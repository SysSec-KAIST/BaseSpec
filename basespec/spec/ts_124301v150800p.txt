between User Equipment (UE) and Mobility Management Entity (MME) in the Evolved Packet System (EPS). These
protocols belong to the non-access stratum (NAS).

The EPS Mobility Management (EMM) protocol defined in the present document provides procedures for the control of
mobility when the User Equipment (UE) is using the Evolved UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network (E-UTRAN).
The EMM protocol also provides control of security for the NAS protocols.

The EPS Session Management (ESM) protocol defined in the present document provides procedures for the handling of
EPS bearer contexts. Together with the bearer control provided by the access stratum, this protocol is used for the
control of user plane bearers.

For both NAS protocols the present document specifies procedures for the support of inter-system mobility between
E-UTRAN and other 3GPP or non-3GPP access networks:

    -     For inter-system mobility between E-UTRAN and GERAN, UTRAN or NG-RAN, this includes rules for a
          mapping between parameters and procedures used by the NAS protocols defined in the present document and the
          NAS protocols specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 [13] for GERAN and UTRAN, and 3GPP TS 24.501 [54] for NG-
          RAN.

    -     For inter-system mobility between E-UTRAN and generic non-3GPP access networks, this includes specific
          NAS procedures to maintain IP connectivity to the PDN Gateway and to provide parameters needed by the UE
          when using mobility management based on Dual-Stack Mobile IPv6 (see 3GPP TS 24.303 [14]) or MIPv4
          (see 3GPP TS 24.304 [15]).

The present document is applicable to the UE and to the Mobility Management Entity (MME) in the EPS.

The present document is also applicable to the relay node in the EPS (see 3GPP TS 23.401 [10]).

The present document also specifies NAS signalling enhancement for the support of efficient transport of IP, non-IP
and SMS data of CIoT capable devices.

Removal of eCall only mode restriction: All the limitations as described in 3GPP TS 22.101 [46] for the eCall only
mode do not apply any more.

The label (S1 mode only) indicates that this subclause or paragraph applies only to a system which operates in S1
mode, i.e. with a functional division that is in accordance with the use of an S1 interface between the radio access
network and the core network. The S1 mode includes WB-S1 mode and NB-S1 mode. In a multi-access system this
case is determined by the current serving radio access network.

In NB-S1 mode: Indicates this paragraph applies only to a system which operates in NB-S1 mode. For a multi-access
system this case applies if the current serving radio access network provides access to network services via E-UTRA by
NB-IoT (see 3GPP TS 36.300 [20], 3GPP TS 36.331 [22], 3GPP TS 36.306 [44]).

In WB-S1 mode: Indicates this paragraph applies only to a system which operates in WB-S1 mode. For a multi-access
system this case applies if the system operates in S1 mode, but not in NB-S1 mode.

In WB-S1/CE mode: Indicates this paragraph applies only when a UE, which is a CE mode B capable UE (see
3GPP TS 36.306 [44]), is operating in CE mode A or B in WB-S1 mode.

SCEF PDN Connection: A PDN connection established between the UE and the Service Capability Exposure Function
(SCEF) for transmitting the UE's non-IP data related to a specific application.

SGi PDN Connection: A PDN connection established between the UE and the Packet Gateway (P-GW) for
transmitting the UE's IP or non-IP data related to a specific application.

S101 mode: Applies to a system that operates with a functional division that is in accordance with the use of an S101
interface. For the definition of the S101 reference point, see 3GPP TS 23.402 [11].

SIPTO at the local network PDN connection: A PDN connection, for which the default EPS bearer context or default
PDP context was activated with an APN authorized to use SIPTO at the local network and it was activated such that the
traffic of the PDN connection will be using an L-GW. The network authorizes an APN for using SIPTO at the local
network based on the subscription profile (see 3GPP TS 29.272 [16C]) and subsequently the network considers this
PDN connection a SIPTO at the local network PDN connection.

SIPTO at the local network PDN connection with a collocated L-GW: A SIPTO at the local network PDN
connection which is established to a L-GW function collocated with the (H)(e)NodeB. The core-network entity (i.e. the
MME or the SGSN) can be aware of whether the SIPTO at the local network PDN connection with a collocated L-GW
is used when the PDN connection is established.

SIPTO at the local network PDN connection with a stand-alone GW: A SIPTO at the local network PDN
connection which is established to a stand-alone GW (with collocated L-GW and S-GW). The core-network entity (i.e.
the MME or the SGSN) can be aware of whether the SIPTO at the local network PDN connection with a stand-alone
GW is used when the PDN connection is established.

"SMS only": A subset of services which includes only Short Message Service. A UE camping on E-UTRAN can
attach to both EPS services and "SMS only".

SMS over NAS: refers to SMS in MME or SMS over SGs.

attach requests from UEs with a certain APN in the subscription.

TAI list: A list of TAIs that identify the tracking areas that the UE can enter without performing a tracking area
updating procedure. The TAIs in a TAI list assigned by an MME to a UE pertain to the same MME area.

Traffic flow aggregate: A temporary aggregate of packet filters that are included in a UE requested bearer resource
allocation procedure or a UE requested bearer resource modification procedure and that is inserted into a traffic flow
template (TFT) for an EPS bearer context by the network once the UE requested bearer resource allocation procedure or
UE requested bearer resource modification procedure is completed.

UE configured for dual priority: A UE which provides dual priority support is configured for NAS signalling low
priority and also configured to override the NAS signalling low priority indicator (see 3GPP TS 24.368 [15A],
3GPP TS 31.102 [17]).

UE configured to use AC11 – 15 in selected PLMN: A UE configured with at least one access class in the range 11-
15 on the USIM, and the access class is applicable in the selected PLMN according to 3GPP TS 22.011 [1A].

UE's availability for voice calls in the IMS: The indication of this availability or non-availability is provided by the
upper layers of the UE as specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [13D] in the annex relevant to the IP-Connectivity Access
Network in use or determined in the NAS layer, as specified in subclause 4.3.1. If availability is indicated, the UE uses
the IM CN Subsystem and can terminate or originate requests for SIP sessions including an audio component with
codecs suited for voice.

UE's usage setting: This is a UE setting that indicates whether the UE has preference for voice services over data
services or vice-versa. If a UE has preference for voice services, then the UE's usage setting is "voice centric". If a UE
has preference for data services, then the UE's usage setting is "data centric". A UE whose setting is "data centric" may
still require access to voice services. A UE whose setting is "voice centric" may still require access to data services.
This definition is derived from 3GPP TS 23.221 [8A] and it applies to voice capable UEs. If the UE is capable of both
S1 mode and N1 mode, there is a single UE's usage setting which applies to both 5GS and EPS (see
3GPP TS 24.501 [54]).

UE using EPS services with control plane CIoT EPS optimization: A UE that is attached for EPS services with the
control plane CIOT EPS optimization accepted by the network.

4             General

4.1           Overview
The non-access stratum (NAS) described in the present document forms the highest stratum of the control plane
between UE and MME at the radio interface (reference point "LTE-Uu"; see 3GPP TS 23.401 [10]).

Main functions of the protocols that are part of the NAS are:

    -   the support of mobility of the user equipment (UE); and




                                                          ETSI
3GPP TS 24.301 version 15.8.0 Release 15                    31                         ETSI TS 124 301 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


   -   the support of session management procedures to establish and maintain IP connectivity between the UE and a
       packet data network gateway (PDN GW).

NAS security is an additional function of the NAS providing services to the NAS protocols, e.g. integrity protection and
ciphering of NAS signalling messages.

For the support of the above functions, the following procedures are supplied within this specification:

   -   elementary procedures for EPS mobility management in clause 5; and

   -   elementary procedures for EPS session management in clause 6.

Complete NAS transactions consist of specific sequences of elementary procedures. Examples of such specific
sequences can be found in 3GPP TS 23.401 [10].

The NAS for EPS follows the protocol architecture model for layer 3 as described in 3GPP TS 24.007 [12]; however,
due to the objective of EPS to provide the subscriber with a "ready-to-use" IP connectivity and an "always-on"
experience, the protocol supports a linkage between mobility management and session management procedures during
the attach procedure (see subclause 4.2).

Signalling procedures for the control of NAS security are described as part of the EPS mobility management in
clause 5. In addition to that, principles for the handing of EPS security contexts and for the activation of ciphering and
integrity protection, when a NAS signalling connection is established, are provided in subclause 4.4.


4.2           Linkage between the protocols for EPS mobility
              management and EPS session management
During the EPS attach procedure, the network can activate a default EPS bearer context (i.e. if the UE requests PDN
connectivity in the attach request). Additionally, the network can activate one or several dedicated EPS bearer contexts
in parallel for PDN connections of IP PDN type. To this purpose the EPS session management messages for the default
EPS bearer context activation can be transmitted in an information element in the EPS mobility management messages.
In this case, the UE and the network execute the attach procedure, the default EPS bearer context activation procedure,
and the dedicated EPS bearer context activation procedure in parallel. The UE and network shall complete the
combined default EPS bearer context activation procedure and the attach procedure before the dedicated EPS bearer
context activation procedure is completed. If EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is not supported by the UE
or the MME, then the success of the attach procedure is dependent on the success of the default EPS bearer context
activation procedure. If the attach procedure fails, then the ESM procedures also fail.

A UE using EPS services with control plane CIoT EPS optimization can initiate transport of user data via the control
plane. For this purpose a UE in EMM-IDLE mode can initiate the service request procedure and transmit the ESM
DATA TRANSPORT message in an information element in the CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message.

Except for the attach procedure and the service request procedure, during EMM procedures the MME shall suspend the
transmission of ESM messages. During the service request procedure the MME may suspend the transmission of ESM
messages.

Except for the attach procedure and the service request procedure for UE initiated transport of user data via the control
plane, during EMM procedures the UE shall suspend the transmission of ESM messages.


4.2A          Handling of NAS signalling low priority indication
A UE configured for NAS signalling low priority (see 3GPP TS 24.368 [15A], 3GPP TS 31.102 [17]) indicates this by
including the Device properties IE in the appropriate NAS message and setting the low priority indicator to "MS is
configured for NAS signalling low priority", except for the following cases in which the UE shall set the low priority
indicator to "MS is not configured for NAS signalling low priority":

   -   the UE is performing an attach for emergency bearer services;

   -   the UE has a PDN connection for emergency bearer services established and is performing EPS mobility
       management procedures, or is establishing a PDN connection for emergency bearer services;




                                                           ETSI
3GPP TS 24.301 version 15.8.0 Release 15                   32                       ETSI TS 124 301 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


   -   the UE configured for dual priority is requested by the upper layers to establish a PDN connection with the low
       priority indicator set to "MS is not configured for NAS signalling low priority";

   -   the UE configured for dual priority is performing EPS session management procedures related to the PDN
       connection established with low priority indicator set to "MS is not configured for NAS signalling low priority";

   -   the UE configured for dual priority has a PDN connection established by setting the low priority indicator to
       "MS is not configured for NAS signalling low priority" and is performing EPS mobility management
       procedures;

   -   the UE is performing a service request procedure for a CS fallback emergency call or 1xCS fallback emergency
       call;

   -   the UE is a UE configured to use AC11 – 15 in selected PLMN; or

   -   the UE is responding to paging.

The network may use the NAS signalling low priority indication for NAS level mobility management congestion
control and APN based congestion control.

If the NAS signalling low priority indication is provided in a PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message, the MME
stores the NAS signalling low priority indication within the default EPS bearer context activated due to the PDN
connectivity request procedure.


4.3           UE mode of operation
4.3.1         General
A UE attached for EPS services shalloperate in one of the following operation modes:

   -   PS mode 1 of operation: the UE registers only to EPS services, and UE's usage setting is "voice centric";

   -   PS mode 2 of operation: the UE registers only to EPS services, and UE's usage setting is "data centric";

   -   CS/PS mode 1 of operation: the UE registers to both EPS and non-EPS services, and UE's usage setting is "voice
       centric"; and

   -   CS/PS mode 2 of operation: the UE registers to both EPS and non-EPS services, and UE's usage setting is "data
       centric".

A UE configured to use CS fallback, shall operate in CS/PS mode 1 or CS/PS mode 2. Such UE may also be configured
to use IMS, in which case the voice domain preference for E-UTRAN as defined in 3GPP TS 24.167 [13B] shall be
used for the selection of the domain for originating voice communication services.

   NOTE 1: The domain selected for originating voice communication services can be ignored by attempting a CS
           emergency call.

Upon request from upper layers to establish a CS emergency call:

   -   if the UE needs to initiate a CS fallback emergency call but it is unable to perform CS fallback, the UE shall
       attempt to select GERAN or UTRAN radio access technology, and a UE with "IMS voice not available" should
       disable the E-UTRA capability (see subclause 4.5) to allow a potential callback, and then progress the CS
       emergency call establishment;

   -   if the UE needs to initiate a 1xCS fallback emergency call but it is unable to perform 1xCS fallback, the UE shall
       attempt to select cdma2000® 1x radio access technology to establish the call.

   NOTE 2: Unable to perform CS fallback or 1xCS fallback means that either the UE was not allowed to attempt CS
           fallback or 1xCS fallback, or CS fallback or 1xCS fallback attempt failed.

A UE configured to use SMS over SGs shall operate in CS/PS mode 1 or CS/PS mode 2.

The behaviour of the UE in CS/PS mode 1 of operation, upon failure to access the CS domain or upon reception of a
"CS fallback not preferred" or "SMS only" indication, will depend on the availability of voice over IMS. In the present
document, "IMS voice not available" refers to one of the following conditions:

   a) the UE is not configured to use IMS;

   b) the UE is not configured to use IMS voice, i.e. when the voice domain preference for E-UTRAN, as defined in
      3GPP TS 24.167 [13B], indicates that voice communication services are allowed to be invoked only over the CS
      domain;

   c) the UE is configured to use IMS voice, but the network indicates in the ATTACH ACCEPT message or the
      TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message that IMS voice over PS sessions are not supported; or

   d) the UE is configured to use IMS voice, the network indicates in the ATTACH ACCEPT message or the
      TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message that IMS voice over PS sessions are supported, but the upper
      layers:

       -   provide no indication that the UE is available for voice call in the IMS within a manufacturer determined
           period of time; or

       -   indicate that the UE is not available for voice calls in the IMS.

   NOTE 3: If conditions a, b and c evaluate to false, the upper layers need time to attempt IMS registration. In the
           event an indication from the upper layers that the UE is available for voice calls in the IMS takes longer
           than the manufacturer determined period of time (e.g. due to delay when attempting IMS registration or
           due to delay obtaining an EPS bearer context for SIP signalling), the NAS layer assumes the UE is not
           available for voice calls in the IMS.

Other conditions may exist but these are implementation specific.

In the present document, "IMS voice available" refers to the conditions a, b, c and d, and other implementation specific
conditions for "IMS voice not available" evaluate to false.


4.3.2         Change of UE mode of operation

4.3.2.1           General
The UE mode of operation can change as a result of e.g.:

   -   a change of UE's usage setting for a CS voice capable UE;

   -   a change of voice domain preference for E-UTRAN as defined in 3GPP TS 24.167 [13B] for a CS voice capable
       UE;

   -   a change in the UE's availability for voice calls in the IMS; or

   -   a change in UE configuration regarding the use of SMS as defined in 3GPP TS 24.167 [13B].

Figure 4.3.2.1.1 and figure 4.3.2.1.2 illustrate the transitions between different UE mode of operations when UE's usage
settings, voice domain preference for E-UTRAN or configuration regarding SMS changes.

4.4           NAS security
4.4.1         General
This clause describes the principles for the handling of EPS security contexts in the UE and in the MME and the
procedures used for the security protection of EPS NAS messages between UE and MME. Security protection involves
integrity protection and ciphering of the EMM and ESM NAS messages.

The signalling procedures for the control of NAS security are part of the EMM protocol and are described in detail in
clause 5.

   NOTE:      The use of ciphering in a network is an operator option. In this subclause, for the ease of description, it is
              assumed that ciphering is used, unless explicitly indicated otherwise. Operation of a network without
              ciphering is achieved by configuring the MME so that it always selects the "null ciphering algorithm",
              EEA0.


4.4.2         Handling of EPS security contexts

4.4.2.1          General
The security parameters for authentication, integrity protection and ciphering are tied together in an EPS security
context and identified by a key set identifier for E-UTRAN (eKSI). The relationship between the security parameters is
defined in 3GPP TS 33.401 [19].

Before security can be activated, the MME and the UE need to establish an EPS security context. Usually, the EPS
security context is created as the result of an EPS authentication procedure between MME and UE. Alternatively:

   -   during inter-system handover from A/Gb mode to S1 mode or from Iu mode to S1 mode, the MME and the UE
       derive a mapped EPS security context from a UMTS security context that has been established while the UE was
       in A/Gb mode or Iu mode; or

   -   during CS to PS SRVCC handover from A/Gb mode to S1 mode or from Iu mode to S1 mode, the MME and the
       UE derive a mapped EPS security context from a CS UMTS security context that has been established while the
       UE was in A/Gb mode or Iu mode.

The EPS security context is taken into use by the UE and the MME, when the MME initiates a security mode control
procedure or during the inter-system handover procedure from A/Gb mode to S1 mode or Iu mode to S1 mode. The
EPS security context which has been taken into use by the network most recently is called current EPS security context.
This current EPS security context can be of type native or mapped, i.e. originating from a native EPS security context or
mapped EPS security context.

The key set identifier eKSI is assigned by the MME either during the EPS authentication procedure or, for the mapped
EPS security context, during the inter-system handover procedure. The eKSI consists of a value and a type of security
context parameter indicating whether an EPS security context is a native EPS security context or a mapped EPS security
context. When the EPS security context is a native EPS security context, the eKSI has the value of KSIASME, and when
the current EPS security context is of type mapped, the eKSI has the value of KSISGSN.

The EPS security context which is indicated by an eKSI can be taken into use to establish the secure exchange of NAS
messages when a new NAS signalling connection is established without executing a new EPS authentication procedure
(see subclause 4.4.2.3) or when the MME initiates a security mode control procedure. For this purpose the initial NAS
messages (i.e. ATTACH REQUEST, TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST, DETACH REQUEST, SERVICE
REQUEST, EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST, and CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST) and the SECURITY
MODE COMMAND message contain an eKSI in the NAS key set identifier IE or the value part of eKSI in the KSI and
sequence number IE indicating the current EPS security context used to integrity protect the NAS message.

In the present document, when the UE is required to delete an eKSI, the UE shall set the eKSI to the value "no key is
available" and consider also the associated keys KASME or K'ASME, EPS NAS ciphering key and EPS NAS integrity key
invalid (i.e. the EPS security context associated with the eKSI as no longer valid).

   NOTE:      In some specifications the term ciphering key sequence number might be used instead of the term Key Set
              Identifier (KSI).

The UE and the MME need to be able to maintain two EPS security contexts simultaneously, i.e. a current EPS security
context and a non-current EPS security context, since:

   -   after an EPS re-authentication, the UE and the MME can have both a current EPS security context and a non-
       current EPS security context which has not yet been taken into use (i.e. a partial native EPS security context);
       and

   -   after an inter-system handover from A/Gb mode to S1 mode or Iu mode to S1 mode, the UE and the MME can
       have both a mapped EPS security context, which is the current EPS security context, and a non-current native
       EPS security context that was created during a previous access in S1 mode or S101 mode.

The number of EPS security contexts that need to be maintained simultaneously by the UE and the MME is limited by
the following requirements:

   -   After a successful EPS (re-)authentication, which creates a new partial native EPS security context, the MME
       and the UE shall delete the non-current EPS security context, if any.

   -   When a partial native EPS security context is taken into use through a security mode control procedure, the
       MME and the UE shall delete the previously current EPS security context.

   -   When the MME and the UE create an EPS security context using null integrity and null ciphering algorithm
       during an attach procedure for emergency bearer services, or a tracking area updating procedure for a UE that
       has a PDN connection for emergency bearer services (see subclause 5.4.3.2), the MME and the UE shall delete
       the previous current EPS security context.

   -   When a new mapped EPS security context or EPS security context created using null integrity and null ciphering
       algorithm is taken into use during the inter-system handover from A/Gb mode to S1 mode or Iu mode to S1
       mode, the MME and the UE shall not delete the previously current native EPS security context, if any. Instead,
       the previously current native EPS security context shall become a non-current native EPS security context, and
       the MME and the UE shall delete any partial native EPS security context.

       If no previously current native EPS security context exists, the MME and the UE shall not delete the partial
       native EPS security context, if any.

   -   When the MME and the UE derive a new mapped EPS security context during inter-system handover from A/Gb
       mode to S1 mode or Iu mode to S1 mode, the MME and the UE shall delete any existing current mapped EPS
       security context.

   -   When a non-current full native EPS security context is taken into use by a security mode control procedure, then
       the MME and the UE shall delete the previously current mapped EPS security context.

   -   When the UE or the MME moves from EMM-REGISTERED to EMM-DEREGISTERED state, if the current
       EPS security context is a mapped EPS security context and a non-current full native EPS security context exists,
       then the non-current EPS security context shall become the current EPS security context. Furthermore, the UE
       and the MME shall delete any mapped EPS security context or partial native EPS security context.

The UE shall mark the EPS security context on the USIM or in the non-volatile memory as invalid when the UE
initiates an attach procedure as described in subclause 5.5.1 or when the UE leaves state EMM-DEREGISTERED for
any other state except EMM-NULL.

The UE shall store the current native EPS security context as specified in annex C and mark it as valid only when the
UE enters state EMM-DEREGISTERED from any other state except EMM-NULL or when the UE aborts the attach
procedure without having left EMM-DEREGISTERED.

4.4.2.2          Establishment of a mapped EPS security context during intersystem
                 handover
In order for the UE to derive a mapped EPS security context for an inter-system change from A/Gb mode or Iu mode to
S1 mode in EMM-CONNECTED mode, the MME shall generate a KSISGSN, create a nonceMME and generate the K'ASME
using the created nonceMME as indicated in 3GPP TS 33.401 [19]. The MME shall include the selected NAS algorithms,
nonceMME and generated KSISGSN (associated with the K'ASME) in the NAS security transparent container for handover to
E-UTRAN. The MME shall derive the EPS NAS keys from K'ASME.

When the UE receives the command to perform handover to E-UTRAN, the UE shall derive K'ASME, as indicated in
3GPP TS 33.401 [19], using the nonceMME received in the NAS security transparent container. Furthermore, the UE
shall associate the derived K'ASME with the received KSISGSN and derive the EPS NAS keys from K'ASME.

When the UE has a PDN connection for emergency bearer services and has no current UMTS security context, the
MME shall set EIA0 and EEA0 as the selected NAS security algorithms in the NAS security transparent container for
handover to E-UTRAN. The MME shall create a locally generated K'ASME. The MME shall set the KSI value of the
associated security context to "000" and the type of security context flag to "mapped security context" in the NAS
security transparent container for handover to E-UTRAN.

When the UE receives the command to perform handover to E-UTRAN and has a PDN connection for emergency
bearer services, if EIA0 and EEA0 as the selected NAS security algorithms are included in the NAS security transparent
container for handover to E-UTRAN, the UE shall create a locally generated K'ASME. The UE shall set the KSI value of
the associated security context to the KSI value received.

If the inter-system change from A/Gb mode or Iu mode to S1 mode in EMM-CONNECTED mode is not completed
successfully, the MME and the UE shall delete the new mapped EPS security context.

The establishment of a mapped EPS security context during inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode in EMM-
CONNECTED mode is specified in 3GPP TS 24.501 [54] subclause 4.4.2.4.

4.4.2.3          Establishment of secure exchange of NAS messages
Secure exchange of NAS messages via a NAS signalling connection is usually established by the MME during the
attach procedure by initiating a security mode control procedure. After successful completion of the security mode
control procedure, all NAS messages exchanged between the UE and the MME are sent integrity protected using the
current EPS security algorithms, and except for the messages specified in subclause 4.4.5, all NAS messages exchanged
between the UE and the MME are sent ciphered using the current EPS security algorithms.

During inter-system handover from A/Gb mode to S1 mode or Iu mode to S1 mode, secure exchange of NAS messages
is established between the MME and the UE by:

   -   the transmission of NAS security related parameters encapsulated in the AS signalling from the MME to the UE
       triggering the inter-system handover (see 3GPP TS 33.401 [19]). The UE uses these parameters to generate the
       mapped EPS security context; and,

   -   after the handover, the transmission of a TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message from the UE to the
       MME. The UE shall send this message integrity protected using the mapped EPS security context, but
       unciphered. From this time onward, all NAS messages exchanged between the UE and the MME are sent
       integrity protected using the mapped EPS security context, and except for the messages specified in
       subclause 4.4.5, all NAS messages exchanged between the UE and the MME are sent ciphered using the mapped
       EPS security context.

During inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode in EMM-CONNECTED mode, secure exchange of NAS
messages is established between the MME and the UE by:

   -   the transmission of NAS security related parameters encapsulated in the AS signalling from the AMF to the UE
       triggering the inter-system handover (see 3GPP TS 33.501 [56]). The UE uses these parameters to generate the
       mapped EPS security context (see subclause 8.6.1 of 3GPP TS 33.501 [56]); and

   -   after the handover, the transmission of a TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message from the UE to the
       MME. The UE shall send this message integrity protected using the mapped EPS security context, but
       unciphered. From this time onward, all NAS messages exchanged between the UE and the MME are sent
       integrity protected using the mapped EPS security context, and except for the messages specified in
       subclause 4.4.5, all NAS messages exchanged between the UE and the MME are sent ciphered using the mapped
       EPS security context.

During inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode in EMM-IDLE mode, if the UE is operating in the single-
registration mode and:

   1) if the tracking area updating procedure is initiated as specified in 3GPP TS 24.501 [54], the UE shall transmit a
      TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message integrity protected with the current 5G NAS security context
      and the UE shall derive a mapped EPS security context (see subclause 8.6.1 of 3GPP TS 33.501 [56]). The UE

      shall include the eKSI indicating the 5G NAS security context value in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE
      REQUEST message.

      After receiving the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message including the eKSI, the MME forwards
      the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message to the source AMF, if possible, to obtain the mapped
      EPS security context from the AMF as specified in 3GPP TS 33.501 [56]. The MME re-establishes the secure
      exchange of NAS messages by either:

      -   replying with a TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message that is integrity protected and ciphered
          using the mapped EPS NAS security context. From this time onward, all NAS messages exchanged between
          the UE and the MME are sent integrity protected and except for the messages specified in subclause 4.4.5, all
          NAS messages exchanged between the UE and the MME are sent ciphered; or

      -   initiating a security mode control procedure. This can be used by the MME to take a non-current EPS
          security context into use or to modify the current EPS security context by selecting new NAS security
          algorithms; or

   2) if the attach procedure is initiated as specified in 3GPP TS 24.501 [54] and:

      -   if the UE has a valid native EPS security context, the UE shall send an ATTACH REQUEST message
          integrity protected with the native EPS security context. The UE shall include the eKSI indicating the native
          EPS security context value in the ATTACH REQUEST message.

      -   if the UE has no valid native EPS security context, the UE shall send an ATTACH REQUEST message
          without integrity protection and encryption.

The secure exchange of NAS messages shall be continued after S1 mode to S1 mode handover. It is terminated after
inter-system handover from S1 mode to A/Gb mode or Iu mode or when the NAS signalling connection is released.

When a UE in EMM-IDLE mode establishes a new NAS signalling connection and has a valid current EPS security
context, secure exchange of NAS messages can be re-established in the following ways:

   1) Except for the cases described in items 3 and 4 below, the UE shall transmit the initial NAS message integrity
      protected with the current EPS security context, but unciphered. The UE shall include the eKSI indicating the
      current EPS security context value in the initial NAS message. The MME shall check whether the eKSI included
      in the initial NAS message belongs to an EPS security context available in the MME, and shall verify the MAC
      of the NAS message. If the verification is successful, the MME may re-establish the secure exchange of NAS
      messages:

      -   by replying with a NAS message that is integrity protected and ciphered using the current EPS security
          context. From this time onward, all NAS messages exchanged between the UE and the MME are sent
          integrity protected and except for the messages specified in subclause 4.4.5, all NAS messages exchanged
          between the UE and the MME are sent ciphered; or

      -   by initiating a security mode control procedure. This can be used by the MME to take a non-current EPS
          security context into use or to modify the current EPS security context by selecting new NAS security
          algorithms; or

   2) If the initial NAS message was a SERVICE REQUEST message or EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST
      message, secure exchange of NAS messages is triggered by the indication from the lower layers that the user
      plane radio bearers are successfully set up. After successful completion of the procedure, all NAS messages
      exchanged between the UE and the MME are sent integrity protected and except for the messages specified in
      subclause 4.4.5, all NAS messages exchanged between the UE and the MME are sent ciphered.

   3) If the UE has no current EPS security context and performs a tracking area updating procedure after an inter-
      system change in idle mode from A/Gb mode to S1 mode or Iu mode to S1 mode, the UE shall send the
      TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message without integrity protection and encryption. The UE shall
      include a nonce and a GPRS ciphering key sequence number for creation of a mapped EPS security context. The
      MME creates a fresh mapped EPS security context and takes this context into use by initiating a security mode
      control procedure and this context becomes the current EPS security context in both the UE and the MME. This
      re-establishes the secure exchange of NAS messages.

   4) If the initial NAS message is a CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message, the UE shall send the
      message integrity protected. If an ESM message container information element or a NAS message container

       information element is included the message shall be sent partially ciphered (see subclause 4.4.5) , otherwise the
       message shall be sent unciphered. Secure exchange of NAS messages is re-established in the UE:

       -   by the indication from the lower layers that the user plane radio bearers are successfully set up;

       -   upon receipt of a NAS message (e.g. a SERVICE ACCEPT message or ESM DATA TRANSPORT
           message) that is integrity protected and ciphered using the current EPS security context; or

       -   upon receipt of a SECURITY MODE COMMAND message that has successfully passed the integrity check.

4.4.2.4           Change of security keys
When the MME initiates a re-authentication to create a new EPS security context, the messages exchanged during the
authentication procedure are integrity protected and ciphered using the current EPS security context, if any.

Both UE and MME shall continue to use the current EPS security context, until the MME initiates a security mode
control procedure. The SECURITY MODE COMMAND message sent by the MME includes the eKSI of the new EPS
security context to be used. The MME shall send the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message integrity protected
with the new EPS security context, but unciphered. When the UE responds with a SECURITY MODE COMPLETE, it
shall send the message integrity protected and ciphered with the new EPS security context.

The MME can also modify the current EPS security context or take the non-current native EPS security context, if any,
into use, by sending a SECURITY MODE COMMAND message including the eKSI of the EPS security context to be
modified and including a new set of selected NAS security algorithms. In this case the MME shall send the SECURITY
MODE COMMAND message integrity protected with the modified EPS security context, but unciphered. When the UE
replies with a SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message, it shall send the message integrity protected and ciphered
with the modified EPS security context.

4.4.2.5           Derivation of keys at CS to PS SRVCC handover from A/Gb mode to S1
                  mode or from Iu mode to S1 mode
At change from A/Gb mode to S1 mode or from Iu mode to S1 mode due to CS to PS SRVCC handover (see
3GPP TS 23.216 [8]), the UE shall derive a mapped EPS security context for the PS domain from the UMTS security
context for the CS domain.

At change from A/Gb mode to S1 mode due to CS to PS SRVCC handover, ciphering may be started and integrity
protection shall be started (see 3GPP TS 36.331 [22]) without any new authentication procedure.

   NOTE 1: CS to PS SRVCC handover from A/Gb mode to S1 mode or from Iu mode to S1 mode is not supported if
           the current CS security context is a GSM security context.

   NOTE 2: For emergency calls, CS to PS SRVCC handover from A/Gb mode to S1 mode or from Iu mode to S1
           mode is not supported.

In order to derive a mapped EPS security context for a CS to PS SRVCC handover from A/Gb mode or Iu mode to S1
mode, the MSC creates a NONCEMSC and generates the CK'PS and IK'PS using the CS UMTS integrity key, the CS
UMTS ciphering key and the created NONCEMSC as specified in annex B.6 in 3GPP TS 33.102 [18]. The MSC
associates the CK'PS and IK'PS with a KSI'PS. The KSI'PS is set to the value of the KSICS associated with the CS UMTS
integrity key and the CS UMTS ciphering key. The MSC transfers the CK'PS, IK'PS and the KSI'PS to the MME. The
MME shall create a mapped EPS security context by setting the K'ASME to the concatenation of the CK'PS and IK'PS
received from the MSC (i.e. CK'PS || IK'PS). The MME shall associate the K'ASME with a KSISGSN. The MME shall set
KSISGSN to the value of the KSI'PS received from the MSC. The MME shall include the selected NAS algorithms,
NONCEMME and generated KSISGSN (associated with the K'ASME) in the NAS security transparent container for the
handover to E-UTRAN. The MME shall derive the EPS NAS keys from K'ASME.

When the UE receives the command to perform CS to PS SRVCC handover to S1 mode, the ME shall generate the
CK'PS and IK'PS using the CS UMTS integrity key, the CS UMTS ciphering key and the received NONCEMSC value in
the transparent container in the CS to PS SRVCC handover command as specified in annex B.6 in
3GPP TS 33.102 [18]. The ME shall ignore the NONCEMME value received in the NAS Security Transparent Container
in the CS to PS SRVCC handover command.

   NOTE 3: The NONCEMME value received in the NAS Security Transparent Container for the handover to E-
           UTRAN is not used by the ME or MME in any key derivation in this handover.

The ME shall create the key K'ASME by concatenating the derived CK'PS and IK'PS (i.e. CK'PS || IK'PS.). The ME shall
associate the derived key K'ASME with a KSISGSN.The ME shall set the KSISGSN associated to K'ASME to the KSISGSN value
received in the NAS Security Transparent Container from the network.

   NOTE 4: Although this case is related to the MSC server enhanced for SRVCC, the name KSISGSN is kept to avoid
           introducing a new name for the same domain.

The ME shall derive the EPS NAS keys (CK' and IK') from the K'ASME as specified in 3GPP TS 33.401 [19]. The ME
shall apply these derived EPS NAS security keys (CK' and IK'), reset the uplink and downlink NAS COUNT values for
the mapped EPS security context (i.e. to the value 0), and replace an already established mapped EPS security context
for the PS domain, if any, in the ME, when the CS to PS SRVCC handover from A/Gb mode or Iu mode has been
completed successfully. If the already established current EPS security context is of type native, then it shall become the
non-current native EPS security context and overwrite any existing non-current native EPS security context in the ME.

The network shall replace an already established mapped EPS security context for the PS domain, if any, when the CS
to PS SRVCC handover from A/Gb mode or Iu mode has been completed successfully. If the already established
current EPS security context is of type native, then it shall become the non-current native EPS security context and
overwrite any existing non-current native EPS security context in the MME.

If the CS to PS SRVCC handover from A/Gb mode or Iu mode has not been completed successfully, the UE and the
network shall delete the new derived mapped EPS security context for the PS domain. Additionally, the network shall
delete an already established mapped EPS security context for the PS domain, if any, if the eKSI of the already
established EPS security context is equal to the KSISGSN of the new derived EPS security context for the PS domain.


4.4.3         Handling of NAS COUNT and NAS sequence number

4.4.3.1           General
Each EPS security context shall be associated with two separate counters NAS COUNT: one related to uplink NAS
messages and one related to downlink NAS messages. The NAS COUNT counters use 24 bit internal representation and
are independently maintained by UE and MME. The NAS COUNT shall be constructed as a NAS sequence number (8
least significant bits) concatenated with a NAS overflow counter (16 most significant bits).

When NAS COUNT is input to NAS ciphering or NAS integrity algorithms it shall be considered to be a 32-bit entity
which shall be constructed by padding the 24-bit internal representation with 8 zeros in the most significant bits.

The value of the uplink NAS COUNT that is stored or read out of the USIM or non-volatile memory as described in
annex C, is the value that shall be used in the next NAS message.

The value of the downlink NAS COUNT that is stored or read out of the USIM or non-volatile memory as described in
annex C, is the largest downlink NAS COUNT used in a successfully integrity checked NAS message.

The NAS sequence number part of the NAS COUNT shall be exchanged between the UE and the MME as part of the
NAS signalling. After each new or retransmitted outbound security protected NAS message, the sender shall increase
the NAS COUNT number by one, except for the initial NAS messages if the lower layers indicated the failure to
establish the RRC connection (see 3GPP TS 36.331 [22]). Specifically, on the sender side, the NAS sequence number
shall be increased by one, and if the result is zero (due to wrap around), the NAS overflow counter shall also be
incremented by one (see subclause 4.4.3.5). The receiving side shall estimate the NAS COUNT used by the sending
side. Specifically, if the estimated NAS sequence number wraps around, the NAS overflow counter shall be
incremented by one.

After the derivation of a NAS token due to an inter-system change from S1mode to A/Gb mode or Iu mode in idle mode
as specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 [13], the UE shall increase the uplink NAS COUNT by one.

When the MME receives a NAS token via SGSN during an idle mode inter-system change from S1 mode to A/Gb
mode or Iu mode, the MME shall check the NAS token as specified in 3GPP TS 33.401 [19], subclause 9.1.1, and
update its uplink NAS COUNT with the uplink NAS COUNT value used for the successful check of the NAS token.

   NOTE 1: The MME does not check the NAS token if it is received via SGSN during a connected mode inter-
           system change from S1 mode to A/Gb mode or Iu mode.

3GPP TS 24.301 version 15.8.0 Release 15                      46                     ETSI TS 124 301 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


During the handover from UTRAN/GERAN to E-UTRAN, when a mapped EPS security context is derived and taken
into use, the MME shall set both the uplink and downlink NAS COUNT counters of this EPS security context to zero.
The UE shall set both the uplink and downlink NAS COUNT counters to zero.

When a mapped EPS security context is derived as specified in 3GPP TS 33.501 [56] and taken into use in the
following cases:

   -   during the inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode; or

   -   during the inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode in EMM-IDLE mode for the UE operating in single-
       registration mode,

the MME shall store the mapped EPS NAS security context with the uplink and downlink NAS COUNT counters
associated with the derived K'ASME key to the uplink and downlink NAS COUNT counters of the mapped EPS NAS
security context respectively. The UE shall set the uplink and downlink NAS COUNT counters to the uplink and
downlink NAS COUNT counters of the current 5G NAS security context respectively.

During the handover from E-UTRAN to UTRAN/GERAN the MME signals the current downlink NAS COUNT value
in a NAS security transparent container (see subclause 9.9.2.6).

During handover to or from E-UTRAN, the MME shall increment downlink NAS COUNT by one after it has created a
NAS security transparent container (see subclause 9.9.2.6 and 9.9.2.7).

   NOTE 2: During the handover from UTRAN/GERAN to E-UTRAN, the NAS security transparent container (see
           subclause 9.9.2.7) is treated as an implicit SECURITY MODE COMMAND message for the UE and the
           MME, and therefore the MME regards the sending of the NAS security transparent container as the
           sending of an initial SECURITY MODE COMMAND message in order to derive and take into use a
           mapped EPS security context for the purpose of the NAS COUNT handling.

In some NAS messages only 5 of the 8 NAS sequence number bits are transmitted. When this is the case, the receiver
shall estimate the remaining 3 most significant bits of the sequence number.

4.4.3.2           Replay protection
Replay protection shall be supported for received NAS messages both in the MME and the UE. However, since the
realization of replay protection does not affect the interoperability between nodes, no specific mechanism is required for
implementation.

Replay protection must assure that one and the same NAS message is not accepted twice by the receiver. Specifically,
for a given EPS security context, a given NAS COUNT value shall be accepted at most one time and only if message
integrity verifies correctly.

Replay protection is not applicable when EIA0 is used.

4.4.3.3           Integrity protection and verification
The sender shall use its locally stored NAS COUNT as input to the integrity protection algorithm.

The receiver shall use the NAS sequence number included in the received message (or estimated from the 5 bits of the
NAS sequence number received in the message) and an estimate for the NAS overflow counter as defined in
subclause 4.4.3.1 to form the NAS COUNT input to the integrity verification algorithm.

The algorithm to calculate the integrity protection information is specified in 3GPP TS 33.401 [19], and the integrity
protection shall include octet 6 to n of the security protected NAS message, i.e. the sequence number IE and the NAS
message IE. The integrity protection of the SERVICE REQUEST message is defined in subclause 9.9.3.28. In addition
to the data that is to be integrity protected, the constant BEARER ID, DIRECTION bit, NAS COUNT and NAS
integrity key are input to the integrity protection algorithm. These parameters are described in 3GPP TS 33.401 [19].

After successful integrity protection validation, the receiver shall update its corresponding locally stored NAS COUNT
with the value of the estimated NAS COUNT for this NAS message.

Integrity verification is not applicable when EIA0 is used.

4.4.3.4           Ciphering and deciphering
The sender shall use its locally stored NAS COUNT as input to the ciphering algorithm.

The receiver shall use the NAS sequence number included in the received message (or estimated from the 5 bits of the
NAS sequence number received in the message) and an estimate for the NAS overflow counter as defined in
subclause 4.4.3.1 to form the NAS COUNT input to the deciphering algorithm.

The input parameters to the NAS ciphering algorithm are the constant BEARER ID, DIRECTION bit, NAS COUNT,
NAS encryption key and the length of the key stream to be generated by the encryption algorithm. When an initial plain
NAS message for transport of user data via control plane (i.e. CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message) is to
be partially ciphered, the length of the key stream is set to the length of the part of the initial plain NAS message (i.e.
the value part of the ESM message container IE or the value part of the NAS message container) that is to be ciphered.

4.4.3.5           NAS COUNT wrap around
If, when increasing the NAS COUNT as specified above, the MME detects that either its downlink NAS COUNT or the
UE's uplink NAS COUNT is "close" to wrap around, (close to 224), the MME shall take the following actions:

   -   If there is no non-current native EPS security context with sufficiently low NAS COUNT values, the MME shall
       initiate a new AKA procedure with the UE, leading to a new established EPS security context and the NAS
       COUNT being reset to 0 in both the UE and the MME when the new EPS security context is activated;

   -   Otherwise, the MME can activate a non-current native EPS security context with sufficiently low NAS COUNT
       values or initiate a new AKA procedure as specified above.

If for some reason a new KASME has not been established using AKA before the NAS COUNT wraps around, the node
(MME or UE) in need of sending a NAS message shall instead release the NAS signalling connection. Prior to sending
the next uplink NAS message, the UE shall delete the eKSI indicating the current EPS security context.

When the EIA0 is used as the NAS integrity algorithm, the UE and the MME shall allow NAS COUNT wrap around. If
NAS COUNT wrap around occurs, the following requirements apply:

   -   the UE and the MME shall continue to use the current security context;

   -   the MME shall not initiate the EPS AKA procedure;

   -   the MME shall not release the NAS signalling connection; and

   -   the UE shall not perform a local release of the NAS signalling connection.


4.4.4         Integrity protection of NAS signalling messages

4.4.4.1           General
For the UE, integrity protected signalling is mandatory for the NAS messages once a valid EPS security context exists
and has been taken into use. For the network, integrity protected signalling is mandatory for the NAS messages once a
secure exchange of NAS messages has been established for the NAS signalling connection. Integrity protection of all
NAS signalling messages is the responsibility of the NAS. It is the network which activates integrity protection.

The use of "null integrity protection algorithm" EIA0 (see subclause 9.9.3.23) in the current security context is only
allowed for an unauthenticated UE for which establishment of emergency bearer services is allowed. For setting the
security header type in outbound NAS messages, the UE and the MME shall apply the same rules irrespective of
whether the "null integrity protection algorithm" or any other integrity protection algorithm is indicated in the security
context.

If the "null integrity protection algorithm" EIA0 has been selected as a integrity protection algorithm, the receiver shall
regard the NAS messages with the security header indicating integrity protection as integrity protected.

Details of the integrity protection and verification of NAS signalling messages are specified in 3GPP TS 33.401 [19].

When a NAS message needs to be sent both ciphered and integrity protected, the NAS message is first ciphered and
then the ciphered NAS message and the NAS sequence number are integrity protected by calculating the MAC. The
same applies when an initial NAS message needs to be sent partially ciphered and integrity protected.

   NOTE:      NAS messages that are ciphered or partially ciphered with the "null ciphering algorithm" EEA0 are
              regarded as ciphered or partially ciphered, respectively (see subclause 4.4.5).

When a NAS message needs to be sent only integrity protected and unciphered, the unciphered NAS message and the
NAS sequence number are integrity protected by calculating the MAC.

When during the EPS attach procedure or service request procedure an ESM message is piggybacked in an EMM
message, there is only one sequence number IE and one message authentication code IE, if any, for the combined NAS
message.

4.4.4.2           Integrity checking of NAS signalling messages in the UE
Except the messages listed below, no NAS signalling messages shall be processed by the receiving EMM entity in the
UE or forwarded to the ESM entity, unless the network has established secure exchange of NAS messages for the NAS
signalling connection:

   -   EMM messages:

       -   IDENTITY REQUEST (if requested identification parameter is IMSI);

       -   AUTHENTICATION REQUEST;

       -   AUTHENTICATION REJECT;

       -   ATTACH REJECT (if the EMM cause is not #25);

       -   DETACH ACCEPT (for non switch off);

       -   TRACKING AREA UPDATE REJECT (if the EMM cause is not #25);

       -   SERVICE REJECT (if the EMM cause is not #25).

   NOTE:      These messages are accepted by the UE without integrity protection, as in certain situations they are sent
              by the network before security can be activated.

All ESM messages are integrity protected.

Once the secure exchange of NAS messages has been established, the receiving EMM or ESM entity in the UE shall not
process any NAS signalling messages unless they have been successfully integrity checked by the NAS. If NAS
signalling messages, having not successfully passed the integrity check, are received, then the NAS in the UE shall
discard that message. The processing of the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message that has not successfully passed
the integrity check is specified in subclause 5.4.3.5. If any NAS signalling message is received as not integrity protected
even though the secure exchange of NAS messages has been established by the network, then the NAS shall discard this
message.

4.4.4.3           Integrity checking of NAS signalling messages in the MME
Except the messages listed below, no NAS signalling messages shall be processed by the receiving EMM entity in the
MME or forwarded to the ESM entity, unless the secure exchange of NAS messages has been established for the NAS
signalling connection:

   -   EMM messages:

       -   ATTACH REQUEST;

       -   IDENTITY RESPONSE (if requested identification parameter is IMSI);

       -   AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE;

       -   AUTHENTICATION FAILURE;

       -   SECURITY MODE REJECT;

       -   DETACH REQUEST;

       -   DETACH ACCEPT;

       -   TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST.

   NOTE 1: The TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message is sent by the UE without integrity protection, if
           the tracking area updating procedure is initiated due to an inter-system change in idle mode and no
           current EPS security context is available in the UE. The other messages are accepted by the MME
           without integrity protection, as in certain situations they are sent by the UE before security can be
           activated.

   NOTE 2: The DETACH REQUEST message can be sent by the UE without integrity protection, e.g. if the UE is
           attached for emergency bearer services and there is no shared EPS security context available, or if due to
           user interaction an attach procedure is cancelled before the secure exchange of NAS messages has been
           established. For these cases the network can attempt to use additional criteria (e.g. whether the UE is
           subsequently still performing periodic tracking area updating or still responding to paging) before
           marking the UE as EMM-DEREGISTERED.

All ESM messages are integrity protected except a PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message if it is sent
piggybacked in ATTACH REQUEST message and NAS security is not activated.

Once a current EPS security context exists, until the secure exchange of NAS messages has been established for the
NAS signalling connection, the receiving EMM entity in the MME shall process the following NAS signalling
messages, even if the MAC included in the message fails the integrity check or cannot be verified, as the EPS security
context is not available in the network:

       -   ATTACH REQUEST;

       -   IDENTITY RESPONSE (if requested identification parameter is IMSI);

       -   AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE;

       -   AUTHENTICATION FAILURE;

       -   SECURITY MODE REJECT;

       -   DETACH REQUEST;

       -   DETACH ACCEPT;

       -   TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST;

       -   SERVICE REQUEST;

       -   EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST;

       -   CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST.

   NOTE 3: These messages are processed by the MME even when the MAC that fails the integrity check or cannot
           be verified, as in certain situations they can be sent by the UE protected with an EPS security context that
           is no longer available in the network.

If an ATTACH REQUEST message is received without integrity protection or fails the integrity check and it is not an
attach request for emergency bearer services, the MME shall authenticate the subscriber before processing the attach
request any further. Additionally, if the MME initiates a security mode control procedure, the MME shall include a
HASHMME IE in the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message as specified in subclause 5.4.3.2. For the case when the
attach procedure is for emergency bearer services see subclause 5.5.1.2.3 and subclause 5.4.2.5.

If a DETACH REQUEST message fails the integrity check, the MME shall proceed as follows:

   -   If it is not a detach request due to switch off, and the MME can initiate an authentication procedure, the MME
       should authenticate the subscriber before processing the detach request any further.

   -   If it is a detach request due to switch off, or the MME does not initiate an authentication procedure for any other
       reason, the MME may ignore the detach request and remain in state EMM-REGISTERED.

   NOTE 4: The network can attempt to use additional criteria (e.g. whether the UE is subsequently still performing
           periodic tracking area updating or still responding to paging) before marking the UE as EMM-
           DEREGISTERED.

If a TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message is received without integrity protection or fails the integrity
check and the UE provided a nonceUE, GPRS ciphering key sequence number, P-TMSI and RAI in the TRACKING
AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, the MME shall initiate a security mode control procedure to take a new mapped
EPS security context into use; otherwise if the UE has only a PDN connection for non-emergency bearer services
established, the MME shall initiate an authentication procedure. Additionally, if the MME initiates a security mode
control procedure, the MME shall include a HASHMME IE in the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message as specified
in subclause 5.4.3.2. For the case when the UE has a PDN connection for emergency bearer services see
subclause 5.5.3.2.3 and subclause 5.4.2.5.

If a SERVICE REQUEST, EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST or CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message
fails the integrity check and the UE has only PDN connections for non-emergency bearer services established, the
MME shall send the SERVICE REJECT message with EMM cause #9 "UE identity cannot be derived by the network"
and keep the EMM-context and EPS security context unchanged. For the case when the UE has a PDN connection for
emergency bearer services and integrity check fails, the MME may skip the authentication procedure even if no EPS
security context is available and proceed directly to the execution of the security mode control procedure as specified in
subclause 5.4.3. After successful completion of the service request procedure, the network shall deactivate all non-
emergency EPS bearers locally. The emergency EPS bearers shall not be deactivated.

Once the secure exchange of NAS messages has been established for the NAS signalling connection, the receiving
EMM or ESM entity in the MME shall not process any NAS signalling messages unless they have been successfully
integrity checked by the NAS. If any NAS signalling message, having not successfully passed the integrity check, is
received, then the NAS in the MME shall discard that message. If any NAS signalling message is received, as not
integrity protected even though the secure exchange of NAS messages has been established, then the NAS shall discard
this message.


4.4.5         Ciphering of NAS signalling messages
The use of ciphering in a network is an operator option subject to MME configuration. When operation of the network
without ciphering is configured, the MME shall indicate the use of "null ciphering algorithm" EEA0 (see
subclause 9.9.3.23) in the current security context for all UEs. For setting the security header type in outbound NAS
messages, the UE and the MME shall apply the same rules irrespective of whether the "null ciphering algorithm" or any
other ciphering algorithm is indicated in the security context.

When the UE establishes a new NAS signalling connection, it shall send the initial NAS message

   -   partially ciphered, if it is a CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message including an ESM message
       container information element or a NAS message container information element; and

   -   unciphered, if it is any other initial NAS message.

The UE shall partially cipher the CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message by ciphering the value part of the
ESM message container IE or the value part of the NAS message container, using the ciphering algorithm of the current
EPS security context.

The UE shall send the ATTACH REQUEST message always unciphered.

The UE shall send the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message always unciphered.

Except for the CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message including an ESM message container information
element or a NAS message container information element, the UE shall start the ciphering and deciphering of NAS
messages when the secure exchange of NAS messages has been established for a NAS signalling connection. From this
time onward, unless explicitly defined, the UE shall send all NAS messages ciphered until the NAS signalling
connection is released, or the UE performs intersystem handover to A/Gb mode or Iu mode.

The MME shall start ciphering and deciphering of NAS messages as described in subclause 4.4.2.3. From this time
onward, except for the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message, the MME shall send all NAS messages ciphered
until the NAS signalling connection is released, or the UE performs intersystem handover to A/Gb mode or Iu mode.

Once the encryption of NAS messages has been started between the MME and the UE, the receiver shall discard the
unciphered NAS messages which shall have been ciphered according to the rules described in this specification. The
MME shall discard any CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message including an ESM message container
information element or a NAS message container information element which has not been partially ciphered according
to the rules described above.

If the "null ciphering algorithm" EEA0 has been selected as a ciphering algorithm, the NAS messages with the security
header indicating ciphering are regarded as ciphered.

Details of ciphering and deciphering of NAS signalling messages are specified in 3GPP TS 33.401 [19].


4.5          Disabling and re-enabling of UE's E-UTRA capability
When the UE is disabling the E-UTRA capability, it should proceed as follows:

   a) select another RAT (GERAN, UTRAN, or NG-RAN if the UE has not disabled its N1 mode capability for 3GPP
      access as specified in 3GPP TS 24.501 [54]) of the registered PLMN or a PLMN from the list of equivalent
      PLMNs;

   b) if another RAT of the registered PLMN or a PLMN from the list of equivalent PLMNs cannot be found, or the
      UE does not have a registered PLMN, then perform PLMN selection as specified in 3GPP TS 23.122 [6]. As an
      implementation option, instead of performing PLMN selection, the UE may select another RAT of the chosen
      PLMN. If disabling of E-UTRA capability was not due to UE initiated detach procedure for EPS services only,
      the UE may re-enable the E-UTRA capability for this PLMN selection; or

   c) if no other allowed PLMN and RAT combinations are available, then the UE may re-enable the E-UTRA
      capability and remain registered for EPS services in E-UTRAN of the registered PLMN. If the UE chooses this
      option, then it may periodically attempt to select another PLMN and RAT combination that can provide non-EPS
      services. How this periodic scanning is done, is UE implementation dependent.

The UE shall re-enable the E-UTRA capability when performing a PLMN selection unless:

   -   the disabling of E-UTRA capability was due to UE initiated detach procedure for EPS services only; or

   -   the UE has already re-enabled the E-UTRA capability when performing bullets b) or c) above.

If due to handover, the UE moves to a new PLMN in A/Gb or Iu mode which is not in the list of equivalent PLMNs and
not a PLMN memorized by the UE for which E-UTRA capability was disabled, and the disabling of E-UTRA capability
was not due to UE initiated detach procedure for EPS services only, the UE shall re-enable the E-UTRA capability after
the RR/RRC connection is released.

If UE that has disabled its E-UTRA capability due to IMS voice not available and CS fallback not available re-enables
it when PLMN selection is performed, then it should memorize the identity of the PLMNs where E-UTRA capability
was disabled and use that stored information in subsequent PLMN selections as specified in 3GPP TS 23.122 [6].

The UE may support "E-UTRA Disabling for EMM cause #15" and implement the following behaviour:

   -   if the "E-UTRA Disabling Allowed for EMM cause #15" parameter as specified in 3GPP TS 24.368 [15A] or
       3GPP TS 31.102 [17] is present and set to enabled; and

   -   if the UE receives an ATTACH REJECT or TRACKING AREA UPDATE REJECT message including both
       EMM cause #15 "no suitable cells in tracking area" and an Extended EMM cause IE with value "E-UTRAN not
       allowed";

then the UE shall disable the E-UTRA capability, memorize the identity of the PLMN where the E-UTRA capability
was disabled and use that stored information in subsequent PLMN selections as specified in 3GPP TS 23.122 [6].

When the UE supporting the A/Gb and/or Iu mode together with the S1 mode needs to stay in A/Gb or Iu mode, in
order to prevent unwanted handover or cell reselection from UTRAN/GERAN to E-UTRAN, the UE shall disable the
E-UTRA capability.

   -   The UE shall not set the E-UTRA support bits of the MS Radio Access capability IE (see 3GPP TS 24.008 [13],
       subclause 10.5.5.12a), the E-UTRA support bits of Mobile Station Classmark 3 IE (see 3GPP TS 24.008 [13],
       subclause 10.5.1.7), the PS inter-RAT HO from GERAN to E-UTRAN S1 mode capability bit and the ISR

       support bit of the MS network capability IE (see 3GPP TS 24.008 [13], subclause 10.5.5.12) in the ATTACH
       REQUEST message and the ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message after it selects GERAN or
       UTRAN;

   -   the UE shall use the same value of the EPC capability bit of the MS network capability IE (see
       3GPP TS 24.008 [13], subclause 10.5.5.12) in the ATTACH REQUEST message and the ROUTING AREA
       UPDATE REQUEST message; and

   -   the UE NAS layer shall indicate the access stratum layer(s) of disabling of the E-UTRA capability.

When the UE supporting N1 mode together with S1 mode needs to stay in N1 mode, in order to prevent unwanted
handover or cell reselection from NG-RAN to E-UTRAN, the UE shall disable the E-UTRA capability.

   -   the UE shall not set the S1 mode bit to "S1 mode supported" in the S1 UE network capability IE (see
       3GPP TS 24.501 [54]) of the REGISTRATION REQUEST message; and

   -   the UE NAS layer shall indicate the access stratum layer(s) of disabling of the E-UTRA capability.

   NOTE 1: The UE can only disable the E-UTRA capability when in EMM-IDLE mode.

   NOTE 2: Disabling and re-enabling the UE's E-UTRA capability does not affect the UE's capability to access the
           5GC via E-UTRA.

If the UE is disabling its E-UTRA capability before selecting to GERAN, UTRAN or NG-RAN radio access
technology, the UE shall not perform the detach procedure of subclause 5.5.2.1.

If the UE is required to disable the E-UTRA capability and select GERAN, UTRAN or NG-RAN radio access
technology, and the UE is in the EMM-CONNECTED mode, the UE shall locally release the established NAS
signalling connection and enter the EMM-IDLE mode before selecting GERAN, UTRAN or NG-RAN radio access
technology.

If the E-UTRA capability was disabled due to the attempt to select GERAN or UTRAN radio access technology
progressing the CS emergency call establishment (see subclause 4.3.1), the criteria to enable the E-UTRA capability
again is UE implementation specific.

If the E-UTRA capability was disabled due to the UE initiated detach procedure for EPS services only (see
subclause 5.5.2.2.2), upon request of the upper layers to re-attach for EPS services the UE shall enable the E-UTRA
capability again. If the E-UTRA capability was disabled due to receipt of EMM cause #14 "EPS services not allowed in
this PLMN", then the UE shall enable the E-UTRA capability when the UE powers off and powers on again or the
USIM is removed. If E-UTRA capability was disabled for any other reason, the UE shall enable the E-UTRA capability
in the following cases:

   -   the UE mode of operation changes from CS/PS mode 1 of operation to CS/PS mode 2 of operation;

   -   the UE mode of operation changes from PS mode 1 of operation to PS mode 2 of operation; or

   -   the UE powers off and powers on again or the USIM is removed;

As an implementation option, the UE may start a timer for enabling E-UTRA when the UE's attach attempt counter or
tracking area updating attempt counter reaches 5 and the UE disables E-UTRA capability for cases described in
subclauses 5.5.1.2.6, 5.5.1.3.4.3, 5.5.1.3.6, 5.5.3.2.6, 5.5.3.3.4.3 and 5.5.3.3.6. The UE should memorize the identity of
the PLMNs where E-UTRA capability were disabled. On expiry of this timer:

   -   if the UE is in Iu mode or A/Gb mode and is in idle mode as specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 [13] on expiry of the
       timer, the UE should enable the E-UTRA capability;

   -   if the UE is in Iu mode or A/Gb mode and an RR connection exists, the UE shall delay enabling E-UTRA
       capability until the RR connection is released;

   -   if the UE is in Iu mode and a PS signalling connection exists but no RR connection exists, the UE may abort the
       PS signalling connection before enabling E-UTRA capability;

   -   if the UE is in N1 mode and is in 5GMM-IDLE mode as specified in 3GPP TS 24.501 [54], on expiry of the
       timer, the UE should enable the E-UTRA capability; and

   -   if the UE is in N1 mode and is in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode as specified in 3GPP TS 24.501 [54], on expiry
       of the timer, the UE shall delay enabling the E-UTRA capability until the N1 NAS signalling connection is
       released.

If the UE attempts to establish an emergency bearer service in a PLMN where the E-UTRA capability was disabled due
to the UE's attach attempt counter or tracking area updating attempt counter have reached 5, the UE may enable the E-
UTRA capability for that PLMN memorized by the UE.

For other cases, it is up to the UE implementation when to enable the E-UTRA capability.

   NOTE 3: If the UE is not operating in CS/PS mode 1 operation, the value of the timer for enabling E-UTRA
           capability is recommended to be not larger than the default value of T3402.


4.6           Applicability of procedures
4.6.1         Relay nodes
A relay node shall support all procedures that are mandatory for a UE supporting S1 mode only.

There is also functionality which is only applicable to a relay node, in which case the specification uses the term "relay
node" instead of "UE".


4.7           EPS mobility management and EPS session management
              in NB-S1 mode
A UE in NB-S1 mode (see 3GPP TS 36.331 [22]) shall calculate the value of the applicable NAS timer:

   -   indicated in table 10.2.1 plus 240s; and

   -   indicated in table 10.3.1 plus 180s.

The timer value obtained is used as described in the appropriate procedure subclause of this specification. The NAS
timer value shall be calculated at start of a NAS procedure and shall not re-calculate the use of the NAS timer value
until the NAS procedure is completed, restarted or aborted.

When an MME that supports NB-S1 mode performs NAS signaling with a UE, which is using NB-S1 mode, the MME
shall calculate the value of the applicable NAS timer:

   -   indicated in table 10.2.2 plus 240s; and

   -   indicated in table 10.3.2 plus 180s.

The timer value obtained is used as described in the appropriate procedure subclause of this specification. The NAS
timer value shall be calculated at start of a NAS procedure and shall not re-calculate the use of the NAS timer value
until the NAS procedure is completed, restarted or aborted.

   NOTE:      If the tracking area update procedure is initiated in EMM-CONNECTED mode, the MME can stop any
              running implementation specific supervision timer if it is started when sending an ESM DATA
              TRANSPORT message to the UE.


4.8           EPS mobility management and EPS session management
              in WB-S1 mode for IoT
In WB-S1 mode, a UE operating in category CE can operate in either CE mode A or CE mode B (see 3GPP TS 36.306
[44]). If a UE that supports CE mode B and operates in WB-S1 mode and the UE's usage setting is not set to "voice
centric" (see 3GPP TS 23.401 [10]), the UE shall apply the value of the applicable NAS timer indicated in tables 10.2.1
and indicated in table 10.3.1 for WB-S1/CE mode.

The NAS timer value obtained is used as described in the appropriate procedure subclause of this specification. The
NAS timer value shall be calculated at start of a NAS procedure, and shall not be re-calculated until the NAS procedure
is completed, restarted or aborted.

The support of CE mode B by a UE is indicated to the MME by lower layers and shall be stored by the MME. When an
MME that supports WB-S1 mode performs NAS signaling with a UE, which supports CE mode B and operates in WB-
S1 mode and the MME determines that

   -   the use of enhanced coverge is not restricted for the UE; or

   -   CE mode B is not restricted for the UE (see 3GPP TS 23.401 [10])

the MME shall calculate the value of the applicable NAS timer indicated in tables 10.2.2 and indicated in table 10.3.2
for WB-S1/CE mode.

The NAS timer value obtained is used as described in the appropriate procedure subclause of this specification. The
NAS timer value shall be calculated at start of a NAS procedure and shall not be re-calculated until the NAS procedure
is completed, restarted or aborted.


4.9           Disabling and re-enabling of UE's NB-IoT capability
If the UE supports disabling and re-enabling of UE's NB-IoT capability and the UE in NB-S1 mode is disabling the NB-
IoT capability, it should proceed as follows:

   a) select E-UTRAN of the registered PLMN or a PLMN from the list of equivalent PLMNs;

   b) if E-UTRAN of the registered PLMN or a PLMN from the list of equivalent PLMNs cannot be found, select
      another RAT (GERAN, UTRAN, or NG-RAN if the UE has not disabled its N1 mode capability for 3GPP
      access as specified in 3GPP TS 24.501 [54]) of the registered PLMN or a PLMN from the list of equivalent
      PLMNs;

   c) if another RAT of the registered PLMN or a PLMN from the list of equivalent PLMNs cannot be found, or the
      UE does not have a registered PLMN, then perform PLMN selection as specified in 3GPP TS 23.122 [6]. As an
      implementation option, instead of performing PLMN selection, the UE may select another RAT of the chosen
      PLMN; or

   d) if no other allowed PLMN and RAT combinations are available, then the UE may re-enable the NB-IoT
      capability and remain registered for EPS services in NB-IoT of the registered PLMN. If the UE chooses this
      option, then it may periodically attempt to select another PLMN and RAT combination that can provide non-EPS
      services. How this periodic scanning is done, is UE implementation dependent.

If the the NB-IoT capability is disabled, the UE shall re-enable the NB-IoT capability when:

   -   performing a PLMN selection unless the UE has already re-enabled the NB-IoT capability when performing
       bullets c) or d) above; or

   -   the UE powers off and powers on again or the USIM is removed.

If the UE in NB-S1 mode receives an ATTACH REJECT or TRACKING AREA UPDATE REJECT message
including both EMM cause #15 "no suitable cells in tracking area" and an Extended EMM cause IE with value "NB-IoT
not allowed" after the UE requests access to the NB-IoT, in order to prevent unwanted cell reselection from GERAN,
UTRAN, E-UTRAN or NG-RAN to NB-IoT, the UE may:

   -   disable the NB-IoT capability:

   -   indicate the access stratum layer(s) of disabling of the NB-IoT capability; and

   -   memorize the identity of the PLMN where the NB-IoT capability was disabled and use that stored information in
       subsequent PLMN selections as specified in 3GPP TS 23.122 [6].

   NOTE:      The UE can only disable the NB-IoT capability when in EMM-IDLE mode.

If the UE in NB-S1 mode is required to disable the NB-IoT capability and select E-UTRAN radio access technology,
and the UE is in the EMM-CONNECTED mode, the UE shall locally release the established NAS signalling connection
and enter the EMM-IDLE mode before selecting E-UTRAN radio access technology.

As an implementation option, the UE may start a timer for enabling the NB-IoT capability. On expiry of this timer, the
UE may enable the NB-IoT capability.



5             Elementary procedures for EPS mobility
              management

5.1           Overview
5.1.1         General
This clause describes the procedures used for mobility management for EPS services (EMM) at the radio interface
(reference point "LTE-Uu").

The main function of the mobility management sublayer is to support the mobility of a user equipment, such as
informing the network of its present location and providing user identity confidentiality.

A further function of the mobility management sublayer is to provide connection management services to the session
management (SM) sublayer and the short message services (SMS) entity of the connection management (CM) sublayer.

All the EMM procedures described in this clause can only be performed if a NAS signalling connection has been
established between the UE and the network. Else, the EMM sublayer has to initiate the establishment of a NAS
signalling connection (see 3GPP TS 36.331 [22]).


5.1.2         Types of EMM procedures
Depending on how they can be initiated, three types of EMM procedures can be distinguished:

    1) EMM common procedures:

       An EMM common procedure can always be initiated whilst a NAS signalling connection exists. The procedures
       belonging to this type are:

          Initiated by the network:

              -   GUTI reallocation;

              -   authentication;

              -   security mode control;

              -   identification;

              -   EMM information.

    2) EMM specific procedures:

       At any time only one UE initiated EMM specific procedure can be running. The procedures belonging to this
       type are:

          Initiated by the UE and used to attach the IMSI in the network for EPS services and/or non-EPS services, and
          to establish an EMM context and if requested by the UE, a default bearer:

              -   attach and combined attach.

          Initiated by the UE and used to attach the IMSI or IMEI for emergency bearer services, and to establish an
          EMM context and a default bearer to a PDN that provides emergency bearer services:

              -   attach.

          Initiated by the UE or the network and used to detach the IMSI in the network for EPS services and/or non-
          EPS services and to release an EMM context and all bearers, if any:



                                                         ETSI
3GPP TS 24.301 version 15.8.0 Release 15                    56                       ETSI TS 124 301 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


              -   detach and combined detach.

          Initiated by the UE and used to detach the IMSI in the network for EPS services or non-EPS services and to
          release an EMM context and all bearers, if any:

              -   eCall inactivity procedure.

          Initiated by the UE when an EMM context has been established:

              -   normal tracking area updating and combined tracking area updating (S1 mode only);

              -   periodic tracking area updating (S1 mode only).

          The tracking area updating procedure can be used to request also the resource reservation for sending data.

   3) EMM connection management procedures (S1 mode only):

          Initiated by the UE and used to establish a secure connection to the network or to request the resource
          reservation for sending data, or both:

              -   service request.

          The service request procedure can only be initiated if no UE initiated EMM specific procedure is ongoing.

          Initiated by the network and used to request the establishment of a NAS signalling connection or to prompt
          the UE to re-attach if necessary as a result of a network failure:

              -   paging procedure.

          Initiated by the UE or the network and used to transport NAS messages:

              -   transport of NAS messages;

              -   generic transport of NAS messages.

          The transport of NAS messages procedure and the generic transport of NAS messages procedure cannot be
          initiated while an EMM specific procedure or a service request procedure is ongoing.


5.1.3         EMM sublayer states

5.1.3.1           General
In the following subclauses, the EMM protocol of the UE and the network is described by means of two different state
machines. In subclause 5.1.3.2, the states of the EMM entity in the UE are introduced. The behaviour of the UE
depends on an EPS update status that is described in subclause 5.1.3.3. The states for the MME side are described in
subclause 5.1.3.4.

5.1.3.2           EMM sublayer states in the UE

5.1.3.2.1            General
In the following subclauses, the possible EMM states of an EMM entity in the UE are described. Subclause 5.1.3.2.2
summarizes the main states of an EMM entity. The substates that have been defined are described in subclause 5.1.3.2.3
and subclause 5.1.3.2.4.

It should be noted, however, that this subclause does not include a description of the detailed behaviour of the UE in the
single states and does not cover abnormal cases. A detailed description of the behaviour of the UE is given in
subclause 5.2. For the behaviour of the UE in abnormal cases refer to the description of the elementary EMM
procedures in subclauses 5.4, 5.5, 5.6 and 5.7.

5.1.3.2.2           Main states

5.1.3.2.2.1             EMM-NULL

EPS services are disabled in the UE. No EPS mobility management function shall be performed in this state.

5.1.3.2.2.2             EMM-DEREGISTERED

In the state EMM-DEREGISTERED, no EMM context has been established and the UE location is unknown to an
MME and hence it is unreachable by an MME. In order to establish an EMM context, the UE shall start the attach or
combined attach procedure (see subclause 5.5.1).

5.1.3.2.2.3             EMM-REGISTERED-INITIATED

A UE enters the state EMM-REGISTERED-INITIATED after it has started the attach or the combined attach procedure
and is waiting for a response from the MME (see subclause 5.5.1).

5.1.3.2.2.4             EMM-REGISTERED

In the state EMM-REGISTERED an EMM context has been established. Additionally a default EPS bearer context has
been activated in the UE:

   -   if EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is not supported by the UE or the MME; or

       -   if EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is supported by the UE and the MME, the UE has
           requested connectivity to a PDN and a default EPS bearer context is successfully established.

When the UE is in EMM-IDLE mode, the UE location is known to the MME with an accuracy of a list of tracking areas
containing a certain number of tracking areas. When the UE is in EMM-CONNECTED mode, the UE location is known
to the MME with an accuracy of a serving eNodeB. The UE may initiate sending and receiving user data and signalling
information and reply to paging. Additionally, tracking area updating or combined tracking area updating procedure is
performed (see subclause 5.5.3).

5.1.3.2.2.5             EMM-DEREGISTERED-INITIATED

A UE enters the state EMM-DEREGISTERED-INITIATED after it has requested release of the EMM context by
starting the detach or combined detach procedure and is waiting for a response from the MME (see subclause 5.5.2).

5.1.3.2.2.6             EMM-TRACKING-AREA-UPDATING-INITIATED

A UE enters the state EMM-TRACKING-AREA-UPDATING-INITIATED after it has started the tracking area
updating or combined tracking area updatingprocedure and is waiting for a response from the MME (see
subclause 5.5.3).

5.1.3.2.2.7             EMM-SERVICE-REQUEST-INITIATED

A UE enters the state EMM-SERVICE-REQUEST-INITIATED after it has started the service request procedure and is
waiting for a response from the MME (see subclause 5.6.1).

5.1.3.2.3            Substates of state EMM-DEREGISTERED

5.1.3.2.3.1               General

The state EMM-DEREGISTERED is subdivided into a number of substates as described in this subclause. Valid
subscriber data are available for the UE before it enters the substates, except for the substate EMM-
DEREGISTERED.NO-IMSI.

5.1.3.2.3.2               EMM-DEREGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE

The substate EMM-DEREGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE is chosen in the UE when a suitable cell has been found
and the PLMN or tracking area is not in the forbidden list.

5.1.3.2.3.3               EMM-DEREGISTERED.LIMITED-SERVICE

The substate EMM-DEREGISTERED.LIMITED-SERVICE is chosen in the UE, when it is known that a selected cell
is unable to provide normal service (e.g. the selected cell is in a forbidden PLMN, is in a forbidden tracking area or the
selected cell is a CSG cell whose CSG ID and associated PLMN identity are not included in the UE's Allowed CSG list
or in the UE's Operator CSG List).




                                                                 ETSI
3GPP TS 24.301 version 15.8.0 Release 15                    59                        ETSI TS 124 301 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


5.1.3.2.3.4              EMM-DEREGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-ATTACH

The substate EMM-DEREGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-ATTACH is chosen in the UE if the attach or combined
attach procedure failed due to a missing response from the network or due to the circumstances described in
subclauses 5.5.1.2.5, 5.5.1.2.6 and 5.5.1.3.5.

5.1.3.2.3.5              EMM-DEREGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH

The substate EMM-DEREGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH is chosen in the UE, if the UE is searching for PLMNs. This
substate is left either when a cell has been selected (the new substate is NORMAL-SERVICE or LIMITED-SERVICE)
or when it has been concluded that no cell is available at the moment (the new substate is NO-CELL-AVAILABLE).

5.1.3.2.3.6              EMM-DEREGISTERED.NO-IMSI

The substate EMM-DEREGISTERED.NO-IMSI is chosen in the UE, if the UE has no valid subscriber data available
(SIM/USIM not available, or the SIM/USIM is considered invalid by the UE) and a cell has been selected.

5.1.3.2.3.7              EMM-DEREGISTERED.ATTACH-NEEDED

Valid subscriber data are available for the UE and for some reason an attach must be performed as soon as possible.
This substate can be entered if the access class is blocked due to access class control, or if the network rejects the NAS
signalling connection establishment.

5.1.3.2.3.8              EMM-DEREGISTERED.NO-CELL-AVAILABLE

No E-UTRAN cell can be selected. This substate is entered after a first intensive search failed when in substate EMM-
DEREGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH. Cells are searched for at a low rhythm. No EPS services are offered.

5.1.3.2.3.9              EMM-DEREGISTERED.eCALL-INACTIVE

The substate EMM-DEREGISTERED.eCALL-INACTIVE is chosen in the UE when:

   -   the UE is configured for eCall only mode as specified in 3GPP TS 31.102 [17];

   -   timer T3444 and timer T3445 have expired or are not running;

   -   a PLMN has been selected as specified in 3GPP TS 23.122 [6];

   -   the UE does not need to perform an eCall over IMS; and

   -   the UE does not need to perform a call to a non-emergency MSISDN or URI for test or terminal reconfiguration
       service.

In this substate, the UE shall not initiate any signalling towards the network, except to originate an eCall over IMS, or a
call to a non-emergency MSISDN or URI for test or terminal reconfiguration service.

5.1.3.2.4            Substates of state EMM-REGISTERED

5.1.3.2.4.1              General

The state EMM-REGISTERED is subdivided into a number of substates as described in this subclause.

5.1.3.2.4.2              EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE

The substate EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE is chosen by the UE as the primary substate when the UE
enters the state EMM-REGISTERED.

5.1.3.2.4.3              EMM-REGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-UPDATE

The substate EMM-REGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-UPDATE is chosen by the UE if the tracking area updating or
combined tracking area updating procedure failed due to a missing response from the network or due to the
circumstances described in subclauses 5.5.3.2.5, 5.5.3.2.6, 5.5.3.3.5, 5.6.1.5 and 5.6.1.6. No EMM procedure except the

tracking area updating or combined tracking area updating procedure shall be initiated by the UE in this substate. No
data shall be sent or received.

5.1.3.2.4.4               EMM-REGISTERED.LIMITED-SERVICE

The substate EMM-REGISTERED.LIMITED-SERVICE is chosen in the UE, if the cell the UE selected is known not
to be able to provide normal service.

5.1.3.2.4.5               EMM-REGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH

The substate EMM-REGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH is chosen in the UE, while the UE is searching for PLMNs.

5.1.3.2.4.6               EMM-REGISTERED.UPDATE-NEEDED

The UE has to perform a tracking area updating or combined tracking area updating procedure, but access to the current
cell is barred. This state can be entered if the access class is blocked due to access class control, or if the network rejects
the NAS signalling connection establishment.

No EMM procedure except:

   -   tracking area updating;

   -   combined tracking area updating; or

   -   service request as a response to paging

shall be initiated by the UE in this substate.

5.1.3.2.4.7               EMM-REGISTERED.NO-CELL-AVAILABLE

E-UTRAN coverage has been lost or PSM is active in the UE. If PSM is active, the UE can deactivate PSM at any time
by activating the AS layer when the UE needs to send mobile originated signalling or user data. Otherwise, the UE shall
not initiate any EMM procedure except for cell and PLMN reselection.

5.1.3.2.4.8               EMM-REGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-UPDATE-MM

A combined attach procedure or a combined tracking area updating procedure was successful for EPS services only.
User data and signalling information may be sent and received.

5.1.3.2.4.9               EMM-REGISTERED.IMSI-DETACH-INITIATED

The UE performs a combined detach procedure for non-EPS services only (detach type "IMSI detach"). This substate is
entered if the UE is attached for EPS and non-EPS services and wants to detach for non-EPS services only. User data
and signalling information may be sent and received.

5.1.3.3           EPS update status
In order to describe the detailed UE behaviour, the EPS update (EU) status pertaining to a specific subscriber is defined.

The EPS update status is stored in a non-volatile memory in the USIM if the corresponding file is present in the USIM,
else in the non-volatile memory in the ME, as described in annex C.

The EPS update status value is changed only after the execution of an attach or combined attach, network initiated
detach, authentication, tracking area update or combined tracking area update, service request or paging for EPS
services using IMSI procedure or due to change in TAI which is not part of TAI list while timer T3346 is running.

   EU1: UPDATED

       The last attach or tracking area updating attempt was successful.

   EU2: NOT UPDATED

       The last attach, service request or tracking area updating attempt failed procedurally, e.g. no response or reject
       message was received from the MME.

   EU3: ROAMING NOT ALLOWED

       The last attach, service request or tracking area updating attempt was correctly performed, but the answer from
       the MME was negative (because of roaming or subscription restrictions).

5.1.3.4          EMM sublayer states in the MME

5.1.3.4.1            EMM-DEREGISTERED
In the state EMM-DEREGISTERED, the MME has no EMM context or the EMM Context is marked as detached. The
UE is detached. The MME may answer to an attach or a combined attach procedure initiated by the UE (see
subclause 5.5.1). The MME may also answer to a tracking area updating procedure or combined tracking area updating
procedure initiated by a UE if the EMM context is marked as detached. The MME may also answer to a detach
procedure initiated by the UE (see subclause 5.5.1.2.7).

If ISR is not activated or ISR is deactivated during a routing area updating or combined routing area updating procedure
or an inter-system handover to A/Gb mode or Iu mode, the MME enters the state EMM-DEREGISTERED after the
successful completion of the procedure.

5.1.3.4.2            EMM-COMMON-PROCEDURE-INITIATED
The MME enters the state EMM-COMMON-PROCEDURE-INITIATED, after it has started a common EMM
procedure (see subclause 5.4) and is waiting for a response from the UE.

5.1.3.4.3            EMM-REGISTERED
In the state EMM-REGISTERED, an EMM context has been established. Additionally a default EPS bearer context has
been activated in the MME:

   -   if EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is not supported by the UE or the MME; or

   -   if EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is supported by the UE and the MME, the UE has requested
       connectivity to a PDN and a default EPS bearer context is successfully established.

5.1.3.4.4            EMM-DEREGISTERED-INITIATED
The MME enters the state EMM-DEREGISTERED-INITIATED after it has started a detach procedure and is waiting
for a response from the UE (see subclause 5.5.2).

5.1.4        Coordination between EMM and GMM
If GMM and EMM are both enabled, a UE capable of S1 mode and A/Gb mode or Iu mode or both shall maintain one
common registration for GMM and EMM indicating whether the UE is registered for packet services or not.

A UE that is not registered shall be in state GMM-DEREGISTERED and in state EMM-DEREGISTERED.

If the UE performs a successful attach or combined attach procedure in S1 mode, it shall enter substates GMM-
REGISTERED.NO-CELL-AVAILABLE and EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE. The UE resets the attach
attempt counter and the GPRS attach attempt counter (see 3GPP TS 24.008 [13]).

If the UE performs a successful GPRS attach or combined GPRS attach procedure in A/Gb or Iu mode, it shall enter
substates GMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE and EMM-REGISTERED.NO-CELL-AVAILABLE. The UE
resets the attach attempt counter and the GPRS attach attempt counter (see 3GPP TS 24.008 [13]).

without PDN connection is not supported by the UE or the MME, the UE shall move to state EMM-DEREGISTERED
and state GMM-DEREGISTERED and then initiate an attach procedure. If EMM-REGISTERED without PDN
connection is supported by the UE and the MME, the UE shall enter substates EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-
SERVICE and GMM-REGISTERED.NO-CELL-AVAILABLE and initiate a tracking area updating procedure.

After successful completion of routing area updating or combined routing area updating and tracking area updating or
combined tracking area updating procedures in both S1 mode and A/Gb or Iu mode, if the network has indicated that
ISR is activated, the UE shall maintain registration and related periodic update timers in both GMM and EMM.

   NOTE:     As specified in subclause 5.5.3.2.4 of this document or subclause 4.7.5.1.3 of 3GPP TS 24.008 [13], the
             UE does not activate the ISR even if the network has indicated that the ISR is activated e.g. in the
             tracking area updating procedure triggered due to a change in UE network capability. In these scenarios,
             the UE only maintains one registration and related periodic update timer in GMM or EMM.

5.1.5         Coordination between EMM and MM
UEs that operate in CS/PS mode 1 or CS/PS mode 2 of operation shall use the combined EPS/IMSI attach procedure in
order to attach to both EPS and non-EPS services.

UEs that operate in CS/PS mode 1 or CS/PS mode 2 of operation and are already attached to both EPS and non-EPS
services shall use the combined tracking area updating and periodic tracking area updating procedures.

UEs that operate in CS/PS mode 1 or CS/PS mode 2 of operation and are already attached to both EPS and non-EPS
services shall perform a combined detach procedure in order to detach for non-EPS services.

UEs that operate in CS/PS mode 1 or CS/PS mode 2 of operation should not use any MM timers related to MM specific
procedures (e.g. T3210, T3211, T3212, T3213) while camped on E-UTRAN, unless the re-activation of these timers is
explicitly described. If the MM timers are already running, the UE should not react on the expiration of the timers.

If the UE is configured for eCall only mode as specified in 3GPP TS 31.102 [17] and moves from GERAN/UTRAN to
E-UTRAN, the UE shall:

   -   if timer T3242 is running, start timer T3444 with the time left on T3242 and stop timer T3242;

   -   if timer T3243 is running, start timer T3445 with the time left on T3243 and stop timer T3243;

   -   if the UE is attached for both EPS services and non-EPS services and timer T3242 or timer T3243 is running,
       perform a combined tracking area updating procedure; and

   NOTE 1: A UE configured for eCall only mode as specified in 3GPP TS 31.102 [17] being attached for both EPS
           services and non-EPS services upon moving from GERAN/UTRAN to E-UTRAN is only possible in the
           case when the UE has performed a combined attach in E-UTRAN, subsequently moved to
           GERAN/UTRAN and returned to E-UTRAN before timer T3242 or timer T3243 expires.

   -   if the UE is attached for non-EPS services only and timer T3242 or timer T3243 is running, perform a combined
       attach procedure.

   NOTE 2: Timers T3242 and T3243 are specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 [13].


5.2           Behaviour of the UE in state EMM-DEREGISTERED and
              state EMM-REGISTERED
5.2.1         General
In this subclause, the detailed behaviour of the UE in the states EMM-DEREGISTERED and EMM-REGISTERED is
described.


5.2.2         UE behaviour in state EMM-DEREGISTERED

5.2.2.1          General
The state EMM-DEREGISTERED is entered in the UE, when:

   -   the detach or combined detach is performed either by the UE or by the MME (see subclause 5.5.2);

   -   the attach request is rejected by the MME (see subclause 5.5.1);

   -   the tracking area update request is rejected by the MME (see subclause 5.5.3);

   -   the service request procedure is rejected by the MME (see subclause 5.6.1);

   -   the UE deactivates all EPS bearer contexts locally (see subclause 6.4.4.6);

   -   the UE is switched on;

   -   an inter-system change from S1 mode to non-3GPP access is completed and the non-3GPP access network
       provides PDN connectivity to the same EPC; or

   -   the UE attached for emergency bearer services is in EMM-IDLE mode and its periodic tracking area update
       timer expires (see subclause 5.3.5).

In state EMM-DEREGISTERED, the UE shall behave according to the substate as explained in subclause 5.2.2.3.

5.2.2.2           Primary substate selection

5.2.2.2.1            Selection of the substate after power on
For a UE configured for eCall only mode as specified in 3GPP TS 31.102 [17], timers T3444 and T3445 are considered
to have expired at power on. When the UE is switched on, the substate shall be PLMN-SEARCH if the USIM is
available and valid. See 3GPP TS 23.122 [6] for further details.

The substate chosen after PLMN-SEARCH, following power on is:

   -   if no cell can be selected, the substate shall be NO-CELL-AVAILABLE;

   -   if no USIM is present, the substate shall be NO-IMSI;

   -   if a suitable cell has been found and the PLMN or tracking area is not in the forbidden list, then the substate shall
       be NORMAL-SERVICE;

   -   if the selected cell is known not to be able to provide normal service, then the UE shall enter the substate
       LIMITED-SERVICE;

   -   if the UE is in manual network selection mode and no cell of the selected PLMN has been found, the UE shall
       enter the substate NO-CELL-AVAILABLE;

   -   if the selected cell is a non-3GPP cell, the substate shall be NO-CELL-AVAILABLE; and

   -   if the UE is configured for eCall only mode as specified in 3GPP TS 31.102 [17], the substate shall be eCALL-
       INACTIVE.

5.2.2.3           Detailed description of UE behaviour in state EMM-DEREGISTERED

5.2.2.3.1            NORMAL-SERVICE
The UE shall initiate an attach or combined attach procedure.

5.2.2.3.2            LIMITED-SERVICE
The UE shall initiate an attach or combined attach procedure when entering a cell which provides normal service.

The UE may initiate attach for emergency bearer services.

5.2.2.3.3            ATTEMPTING-TO-ATTACH
The UE:

   -   shall initiate an attach or combined attach procedure on the expiry of timers T3411, T3402 or T3346 (see
       3GPP TS 24.008 [13]);

   -   may initiate an attach for emergency bearer services even if timer T3346 is running;

   -   shall initiate an attach or combined attach procedure when entering a new PLMN, if timer T3346 is running and
       the new PLMN is not equivalent to the PLMN where the UE started timer T3346, the PLMN identity of the new
       cell is not in one of the forbidden PLMN lists and the tracking area is not in one of the lists of forbidden tracking
       areas;

   -   shall initiate an attach or combined attach procedure when the tracking area of the serving cell has changed, if
       timer T3346 is not running, the PLMN identity of the new cell is not in one of the forbidden PLMN lists and the
       tracking area of the new cell is not in one of the lists of forbidden tracking areas;

   -   shall use requests for non-EPS services for non-emergency call from CM layers to trigger a combined attach
       procedure, if timer T3346 is not running (see subclause 5.5.1.3), or to attempt to select GERAN or UTRAN
       radio access technology and proceed with the appropriate MM and CC specific procedures;

   -   shall use requests for non-EPS services for emergency call from CM layers to attempt to select GERAN or
       UTRAN radio access technology and proceed with the appropriate MM and CC specific procedures;

   -   may initiate an attach procedure upon receiving a request from upper layers to transmit user data related to an
       exceptional event and the UE is allowed to use exception data reporting (see the
       ExceptionDataReportingAllowed leaf of the NAS configuration MO in 3GPP TS 24.368 [15A]) if timer T3346
       is not already running for "MO exception data" and even if timer T3402 or timer T3411 is running; and

   -   may initiate an attach procedure upon request of the upper layers to establish a PDN connection for emergency
       bearer services, if timer T3346 is not running.

5.2.2.3.4            PLMN-SEARCH
The UE shall perform PLMN selection. If a new PLMN is selected, the UE shall reset the attach attempt counter and
initiate the attach or combined attach procedure (see subclause 5.5.1).

If the selected cell is known not to be able to provide normal service, the UE may initiate attach for emergency bearer
services.

5.2.2.3.5            NO-IMSI
The UE shall perform cell selection according to 3GPP TS 36.304 [21].

The UE may initiate attach for emergency bearer services.

5.2.2.3.6            ATTACH-NEEDED
The UE shall initiate the attach or combined attach procedure, if still needed, as soon as the access is allowed in the
selected cell for one of the access classes of the UE.

The UE may initiate attach for emergency bearer services.

5.2.2.3.7            NO-CELL-AVAILABLE
The UE shall perform cell selection according to 3GPP TS 36.304 [21] and choose an appropriate substate when a cell
is found. When the lower layers indicate to prepare for an S101 mode to S1 mode handover and the PLMN identity of
the target cell provided with this indication is not in one of forbidden PLMN lists, the UE shall enter substate
NORMAL-SERVICE.

   NOTE:      It is assumed that the UE can determine the PLMN identity of networks supporting cdma2000® HRPD
              access from the information broadcast over the radio interface. For the purpose of S101 mode to S1 mode
              handover, the UE can use the PLMN identity of the visited cdma2000® HRPD network also as PLMN
              identity of the target cell.

5.2.2.3.8            eCALL-INACTIVE
The UE camps on a suitable cell or an acceptable cell in a PLMN selected as specified in 3GPP TS 23.122 [6] but
initiates no EMM signalling with the network and ignores any paging requests.

The UE shall leave substate EMM-DEREGISTERED.eCALL-INACTIVE state only when one of the following events
occur:

   -   if the USIM is removed, the UE enters substate EMM-DEREGISTERED.NO-IMSI;

   -   if coverage is lost, the UE enters substate EMM-DEREGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH;

   -   if the UE is deactivated (e.g. powered off) by the user, the UE enters state EMM-NULL;

   -   if the UE receives a request from upper layers to establish an eCall over IMS, the UE enters state EMM-
       DEREGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-ATTACH. The UE then uses the relevant EMM and ESM procedures to
       establish the eCall over IMS at the earliest opportunity; or

   -   if the UE receives a request from upper layers to establish a call to an HPLMN designated non-emergency
       MSISDN or URI for test or terminal reconfiguration service, the UE enters state EMM-
       DEREGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-ATTACH. Once the attach procedure is completed, the UE uses the
       relevant EMM and ESM procedures to establish the non-emergency call.

5.2.2.4          Substate when back to state EMM-DEREGISTERED from another EMM
                 state
When returning to state EMM-DEREGISTERED, the UE shall select a cell as specified in 3GPP TS 36.304 [21].

The substate depends on the result of the cell selection procedure, the outcome of the previously performed EMM
specific procedures, on the EPS update status of the UE, on the tracking area data stored in the UE, on the presence of
the USIM, on the UE configuration and on the reason for moving to EMM-DEREGISTERED:

   -   If no cell has been found, the substate is NO-CELL-AVAILABLE, until a cell is found.

   -   If no USIM is present or if the inserted USIM is considered invalid by the UE, the substate shall be NO-IMSI.

   -   If a suitable cell has been found and the PLMN or tracking area is not in the forbidden list, the substate shall be
       NORMAL-SERVICE.

   -   If an attach shall be performed (e.g. network requested re-attach), the substate shall be ATTEMPTING-TO-
       ATTACH.

   -   If a PLMN reselection (according to 3GPP TS 23.122 [6]) is needed, the substate shall be PLMN-SEARCH.

   -   If the selected cell is known not to be able to provide normal service, the substate shall be LIMITED-SERVICE;

   -   If the selected cell is a non-3GPP cell, the substate shall be NO-CELL-AVAILABLE; and

   -   If the UE is configured for eCall only mode as specified in 3GPP TS 31.102 [17], T3444 and T3445 have
       expired or are not running, and substate PLMN-SEARCH is not required, the substate shall be eCALL-
       INACTIVE.

5.3.1         EMM modes and NAS signalling connection

5.3.1.1           Establishment of the NAS signalling connection
When the UE is in EMM-IDLE mode without suspend indication and needs to transmit an initial NAS message, the UE
shall request the lower layer to establish a RRC connection. In this request to the lower layer the NAS shall provide to
the lower layer the RRC establishment cause and the call type as specified in annex D of this specification and, for the
case specified in subclause 5.6.1.2.2, shall also provide the initial NAS message, otherwise NAS may also provide the
initial NAS message.

Initial NAS messages are:

   -   ATTACH REQUEST;

   -   DETACH REQUEST;

   -   TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST;

   -   SERVICE REQUEST;

   -   EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST; and

   -   CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST.

When the UE is in EMM-IDLE mode with suspend indication, the UE shall proceed the behaviour as specified in
subclauses 5.3.1.3.

For the routing of the initial NAS message to the appropriate MME, the UE NAS provides the lower layers with either
the S-TMSI or the registered globally unique MME identifier (GUMMEI) that consists of the PLMN ID, the MME
group ID, and the MME code (see 3GPP TS 23.003 [2]) according to the following rules:

   -   If the TIN indicates "GUTI" or "RAT-related TMSI", or the TIN is not available, and the UE holds a valid
       GUTI:

       a) When the UE in EMM-IDLE mode initiates a tracking area updating or combined tracking area updating
          procedure for load balancing purposes, the UE NAS shall provide the lower layers with neither S-TMSI nor
          registered MME identifier;

       b) When the tracking area of the current cell is in the list of tracking areas that the UE previously registered in
          the MME during the NAS signalling connection establishment, the UE NAS shall provide the lower layers
          with the S-TMSI, but shall not provide the registered MME identifier to the lower layers; or

       c) When the tracking area of the current cell is not in the list of tracking areas that the UE previously registered
          in the MME during the NAS signalling connection establishment, the UE NAS shall provide the lower layers
          with the MME identifier part of the valid GUTI with an indication that the identifier is a native GUMMEI.

   -   If the TIN indicates "P-TMSI" and the UE holds a valid P-TMSI and RAI, the UE NAS shall provide the lower
       layers with the MME identifier part of the mapped GUTI, which is generated from the P-TMSI and RAI with an
       indication that the identifier is a mapped GUMMEI.

If the UE operates in single-registration mode and was previously registered in 5GS, the UE NAS shall provide the
lower layers with the MME identifier part of the mapped GUTI, which is generated from the 5G-GUTI as specified in
3GPP TS 23.003 [4], an indication that the identifier is a native GUMMEI and an indication that the identifier is
mapped from 5GS.

The UE NAS also provides the lower layers with the identity of the selected PLMN (see 3GPP TS 36.331 [22]). In a
shared network, the UE shall choose one of the PLMN identities as specified in 3GPP TS 23.122 [6].

When an ATTACH REQUEST message, or a TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message when the TAI of the
current cell is not included in the TAI list, is sent to establish a signalling connection, the UE NAS also provides the
lower layers with the DCN-ID according to the following rules:

   a) if a DCN-ID for the PLMN code of the selected PLMN is available in the UE, the UE NAS shall provide this
      DCN-ID to the lower layers; or

   b) if no DCN-ID for the PLMN code of the selected PLMN is available but a Default_DCN_ID value is avaialble in
      the UE, as specified in 3GPP TS 24.368 [15A] or in USIM file NASCONFIG as specified in 3GPP TS 31.102 [17],
      the UE NAS shall provide this DCN-ID to the lower layers.

If a relay node is attaching for relay node operation (see 3GPP TS 23.401 [10]), the NAS in the relay node shall indicate
to the lower layers that the establishment of the NAS signalling connection is for a relay node.

In S1 mode, when the RRC connection has been established successfully, the UE shall enter EMM-CONNECTED
mode and consider the NAS signalling connection established.

In S101 mode, when the cdma2000® HRPD access network resources are available for tunnelled NAS signalling, the
UE shall enter EMM-CONNECTED mode and consider the S101 mode NAS signalling connection established.

5.3.1.2           Release of the NAS signalling connection

5.3.1.2.1            General
The signalling procedure for the release of the NAS signalling connection is initiated by the network.

In S1 mode, when the RRC connection has been released, the UE shall enter EMM-IDLE mode and consider the NAS
signalling connection released.

If the UE is configured for eCall only mode as specified in 3GPP TS 31.102 [17] then:

   -   if the NAS signalling connection that was released had been established for eCall over IMS, the UE shall start
       timer T3444; and

   -   if the NAS signalling connection that was released had been established for a call to an HPLMN designated non-
       emergency MSISDN or URI for test or terminal reconfiguration service, the UE shall start timer T3445.

The UE shall start the SGC timer T3447 with the service gap time value available in the UE when the NAS signalling
connection is released if:

   -   the UE supports SGC feature, and the service gap timer value is available in the UE and does not indicate zero;
       and

   -   the NAS signalling connection that was released had been established for mobile originated request for transfer
       of uplink data.

If the UE receives the "Extended wait time" from the lower layers when no attach, tracking area updating or service
request procedure is ongoing, the UE shall ignore the "Extended wait time".

To allow the network to release the NAS signalling connection, the UE:

   a) shall start the timer T3440 if the UE receives any of the EMM cause values #11, #12, #13, #14 (not applicable to
      the service request procedure), #15, #25 or #35;

   b) shall start the timer T3440 if:

       -   the UE receives a TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message;

       -   the UE has not set the "active" flag in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message;

       -   the UE has not set the "signalling active" flag in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message;

       -   the tracking area updating or combined tracking area updating procedure has been initiated in EMM-IDLE
           mode; and

       -   the user plane radio bearers have not been set up;

      to "IMSI detach" in the DETACH REQUEST message and user plane radio bearers have not been set up;

   d) shall start the timer T3440 if the UE receives a TRACKING AREA UPDATE REJECT message indicating:

       -     any of the EMM cause values #9 or #10 and the UE has no CS fallback emergency call, CS fallback call,
             1xCS fallback emergency call, or 1xCS fallback call pending; or

       -     the EMM cause values #40, the TRACKING AREA UPDATE message was not triggered due to receiving a
             paging for CS fallback or a paging for 1xCS fallback, and the UE has no CS fallback emergency call, CS
             fallback call, 1xCS fallback emergency call, or 1xCS fallback call pending;

   e) shall start the timer T3440 if the UE receives a SERVICE REJECT message indicating any of the EMM cause
      values #9, #10 or #40 as a response to a SERVICE REQUEST message CONTROL PLANE SERVICE
      REQUEST message, or an EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST message with service type set to "packet services
      via S1";

   f) may start the timer T3440 if the UE receives any of the EMM cause values #7 or #8; or

   g) shall start the timer T3440 if the UE receives a SERVICE REJECT message indicating the EMM cause value
      #39 and the UE has initiated EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST in EMM-IDLE and the user plane radio bearers
      have not been set up.

   h) shall start the timer T3440 if the UE receives a SERVICE REJECT, SERVICE ACCEPT, ATTACH ACCEPT
      or TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message with control plane data back-off timer.

In the UE, when user plane CIoT EPS optimization is used:

   -   Upon indication from the lower layers that the RRC connection has been suspended, the UE shall enter EMM-
       IDLE mode with suspend indication, shall not consider the NAS signalling connection released and shall not
       consider the secure exchange of NAS messages terminated (see subclause 4.4.2.3 and 4.4.5). Based on further
       indications provided by the lower layers, the UE shall update the status of the suspend indication for the EMM-
       IDLE mode;

   -   Upon trigger of a procedure using an initial NAS message when in EMM-IDLE mode with suspend indication,
       the UE shall:

       i) if the initial NAS message is a TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message which includes a UE
          radio capability information update needed IE, enter EMM-IDLE mode without suspend indication and
          proceed with the tracking area updating procedure; and

       ii) otherwise, request the lower layer to resume the RRC connection. In this request to the lower layer the NAS
           shall provide to the lower layer the RRC establishment cause and the call type according to annex D of this
           document;

   NOTE 1: In NB-S1 mode, in the request to the lower layer the data volume information of the initial NAS message
           is provided to the lower layers. Interactions between the NAS and the lower layers in order to obtain the
           data volume information of the initial NAS message (see 3GPP TS 36.321 [49], 3GPP TS 36.331 [22]) is
           left to implementations.

   -   Upon indication from the lower layers that the RRC connection has been resumed when in EMM-IDLE mode
       with suspend indication, the UE shall enter EMM-CONNECTED mode. If the pending NAS message is:

       i) a SERVICE REQUEST message;

       ii) a CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message, and the UE did not include any ESM message
           container, NAS message container or EPS bearer context status information elements; or

       iii) an EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST message, and the Service type information element indicates "packet
            services via S1" and the UE did not include any EPS bearer context status information element,

       the message shall not be sent. Otherwise the UE shall cipher the message as specified in subclause 4.4.5 and
       send the pending initial NAS message upon entering EMM-CONNECTED mode;

   NOTE 2: If a NAS message is discarded and not sent to the network, the uplink NAS COUNT value corresponding
           to that message is reused for the next uplink NAS message to be sent.

   -   Upon fallback indication from the lower layers at RRC connection resume when in EMM-IDLE mode with
       suspend indication, the UE shall enter EMM-IDLE mode without suspend indication, send any pending initial
       NAS message and proceed as if RRC connection establishment had been requested;

   -   Upon indication from the lower layers that the RRC connection resume has failed and indication from the lower
       layers that the RRC connection is suspended, the UE shall enter EMM-IDLE mode with suspend indication and
       restart the ongoing NAS procedure if required; and

   -   Upon indication from the lower layers that the RRC connection resume has failed and indication from the lower
       layers that the RRC connection is not suspended, the UE shall enter EMM-IDLE mode without suspend
       indication and restart the ongoing NAS procedure if required.

In the network, when user plane CIoT EPS optimization is used:

   -   Upon indication from the lower layers that the RRC connection has been suspended, the network shall enter
       EMM-IDLE mode with suspend indication, shall not consider the NAS signalling connection released and shall
       not consider the secure exchange of NAS messages terminated; and

   -   Upon indication from the lower layers that the RRC connection has been resumed when in EMM-IDLE mode
       with suspend indication, the network shall enter EMM-CONNECTED mode.

   For the case that not all suspended bearers are resumed, see subclause 6.4.4.6.

5.3.2         Lists of forbidden tracking areas
The UE shall store a list of "forbidden tracking areas for roaming", as well as a list of "forbidden tracking areas for
regional provision of service". These lists shall be erased when the UE is switched off or when the UICC containing the
USIM is removed, and periodically (with a period in the range 12 to 24 hours). When the lists are erased, the UE
performs cell selection according to 3GPP TS 36.304 [21]. One or more tracking areas is removed from the list of
"forbidden tracking areas for roaming" in the UE, as well as the list of "forbidden tracking areas for regional provision
of service" if, after a subsequent procedure e.g. attach procedure, tracking area updating procedure and GUTI
reallocation procedure, one or more tracking areas in the lists is received from the network. If the UE has only one PDN
connection established which is for emergency bearer services, the tracking areas shall not be removed from these lists
if one or more tracking areas in the lists are received from the network.

In S1 mode, the UE shall update the suitable list whenever an ATTACH REJECT, TRACKING AREA UPDATE
REJECT, SERVICE REJECT or DETACH REQUEST message is received with the EMM cause #12 "tracking area not
allowed", #13 "roaming not allowed in this tracking area", or #15 "no suitable cells in tracking area".

Each list shall accommodate 40 or more TAIs. When the list is full and a new entry has to be inserted, the oldest entry
shall be deleted.


5.3.3         List of forbidden PLMNs for attach in S101 mode
A UE supporting S101 mode shall store a list of "forbidden PLMNs for attach in S101 mode". The UE shall erase this
list when the UE is switched off or when the USIM is removed.

In S101 mode, the UE shall add to the "forbidden PLMNs for attach in S101 mode" list the PLMN identity provided
with the indication from the lower layers to prepare for an S101 mode to S1 mode handover whenever an ATTACH
REJECT message is received with the EMM cause #11 "PLMN not allowed", #12 "tracking area not allowed", #13
"roaming not allowed in this tracking area", #14 "EPS services not allowed in this PLMN", #15 "no suitable cells in
tracking area", or #35 "Requested service option not authorized in this PLMN" as specified in subclause 5.5.1.2.5.

The maximum number of possible entries in the "forbidden PLMNs for attach in S101 mode" list is implementation
dependent, but the list shall accommodate at least one PLMN identity. When the list is full and a new PLMN identity
has to be inserted, the UE shall delete the oldest PLMN identity.


5.3.3a        Forbidden PLMNs for EPS services
The forbidden PLMNs for EPS services are contained in the "forbidden PLMNs for GPRS service" list, as defined in
3GPP TS 24.008 [13]. The UE updates this list as part of the attach procedure, tracking area updating procedure and
network initiated detach procedure as described respectively in subclauses 5.5.1, 5.5.3 and 5.5.2.3.2.


5.3.4         Equivalent PLMNs list
The UE shall store a list of equivalent PLMNs. These PLMNs shall be regarded by the UE as equivalent to each other
for PLMN selection and cell selection/re-selection. The same list is used by EMM, GMM and MM.

The UE shall update or delete this list at the end of each attach or combined attach or tracking area updating or
combined tracking area updating procedure. The stored list consists of a list of equivalent PLMNs as downloaded by the
network plus the PLMN code of the registered PLMN that downloaded the list. When the UE is switched off, it shall
keep the stored list so that it can be used for PLMN selection after switch on. The UE shall delete the stored list if the
USIM is removed or when the UE attached for emergency bearer services enters the state EMM-DEREGISTERED.
The maximum number of possible entries in the stored list is 16.


5.3.5         Handling of the periodic tracking area update timer and mobile
              reachable timer (S1 mode only)
The periodic tracking area updating procedure is used to periodically notify the availability of the UE to the network.
The procedure is controlled in the UE by timer T3412. The value of timer T3412 is sent by the network to the UE in the
ATTACH ACCEPT message and can be sent in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message. The UE shall
apply this value in all tracking areas of the list of tracking areas assigned to the UE until a new value is received.

If timer T3412 received by the UE in an ATTACH ACCEPT or TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message
contains an indication that the timer is deactivated or the timer value is zero, then timer T3412 is deactivated and the
UE shall not perform the periodic tracking area updating procedure.

Timer T3412 is reset and started with its initial value, when the UE changes from EMM-CONNECTED to EMM-IDLE
mode. Timer T3412 is stopped when the UE enters EMM-CONNECTED mode or the EMM-DEREGISTERED state.

If the UE is attached for emergency bearer services, and timer T3412 expires, the UE shall not initiate a periodic
tracking area updating procedure, but shall locally detach from the network. When the UE is camping on a suitable cell,
it may re-attach to regain normal service.

When a UE is not attached for emergency bearer services, and timer T3412 expires, the periodic tracking area updating
procedure shall be started and the timer shall be set to its initial value for the next start.

If the UE is not attached for emergency bearer services, and is in a state other than EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-
SERVICE when timer T3412 expires, the periodic tracking area updating procedure is delayed until the UE returns to
EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE.

If ISR is activated, the UE shall keep both timer T3412 and timer T3312. The two separate timers run in the UE for
updating MME and SGSN independently. The UE shall start timer T3423, if timer T3412 expires, and timer T3346 is
running or the UE is in one of the following states:

   -   EMM-REGISTERED.NO-CELL-AVAILABLE;

   -   EMM-REGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH;

   -   EMM-REGISTERED.UPDATE-NEEDED; or

   -   EMM-REGISTERED.LIMITED-SERVICE.

The UE shall initiate the tracking area updating procedure and stop timer T3423 when it enters state EMM-
REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE before timer T3423 expires. After expiry of timer T3423 the UE shall set its TIN
to "P-TMSI".

If timer T3423 expires the UE shall memorize that it has to initiate a tracking area updating procedure when it returns to
state EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE.

If the UE is attached to both EPS and non-EPS services, and if timer T3412 expires or timer T3423 expires when the
UE is in EMM-REGISTERED.NO-CELL-AVAILABLE state, then the UE shall initiate the combined tracking area
updating procedure indicating "combined TA/LA updating with IMSI attach" when the UE returns to EMM-
REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE state.

When the network includes T3412 extended value IE in the ATTACH ACCEPT message or TRACKING AREA
UPDATE ACCEPT message, the network uses timer T3412 extended value IE as the value of timer T3412.

The network supervises the periodic tracking area updating procedure of the UE by means of the mobile reachable
timer.

If the UE is not attached for emergency bearer services, the mobile reachable timer shall be longer than T3412. In this
case, by default, the mobile reachable timer is 4 minutes greater than timer T3412.

If ISR is not activated, the network behaviour upon expiry of the mobile reachable timer is network dependent, but
typically the network stops sending paging messages to the UE on the first expiry, and may take other appropriate
actions.

If the UE is attached for emergency bearer services, the MME shall set the mobile reachable timer with a value equal to
timer T3412. When the mobile reachable timer expires, the MME shall locally detach the UE.

The mobile reachable timer shall be reset and started with the value as indicated above, when the MME releases the
NAS signalling connection for the UE. The mobile reachable timer shall be stopped when a NAS signalling connection
is established for the UE.

Upon expiry of the mobile reachable timer the network shall start the implicit detach timer. The value of the implicit
detach timer is network dependent. If ISR is activated, the default value of the implicit detach timer is 4 minutes greater
than timer T3423. If the implicit detach timer expires before the UE contacts the network, the network shall implicitly
detach the UE. If the MME includes timer T3346 in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REJECT message or the

3GPP TS 24.301 version 15.8.0 Release 15                      76                     ETSI TS 124 301 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


SERVICE REJECT message and timer T3346 is greater than timer T3412, the MME sets the mobile reachable timer
and the implicit detach timer such that the sum of the timer values is greater than timer T3346.

If the network includes the T3324 value IE in the ATTACH ACCEPT message or TRACKING AREA UPDATE
ACCEPT message,and if the UE is not attached for emergency bearer services and has no PDN connection for
emergency bearer services the MME shall set the active timer to a value equal to the value of timer T3324.

   NOTE 1: Timer T3324 is specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 [13].

If the UE has established a PDN connection for emergency services after receiving the timer T3324 value IE in the
ATTACH ACCEPT message or the last TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, the active timer shall not be
started.

The active timer shall be reset and started with the value as indicated above, when the MME releases the NAS
signalling connection for the UE. The active timer shall be stopped when an NAS signalling connection is established
for the UE.

The network behaviour upon expiry of the active timer is network dependent, but typically the network stops sending
paging messages to the UE on the first expiry, and may take other appropriate actions.

   NOTE 2: ISR is not activated when the network includes the T3324 value IE in the ATTACH ACCEPT message or
           TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message.

The implicit detach timer shall be stopped when a NAS signalling connection is established for the UE.


5.3.6         Handling of timer T3402
The value of timer T3402 can be sent by the network to the UE in the ATTACH ACCEPT message and TRACKING
AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message. If the value is different from "deactivated", the UE shall apply this value in all
tracking areas of the list of tracking areas assigned to the UE, until a new value is received.

The value of timer T3402 can be sent by the network to the UE in the ATTACH REJECT message. If an ATTACH
REJECT message including timer T3402 value different from "deactivated", was received integrity protected, the UE
shall apply this value until a new value is received with integrity protection or a new PLMN is selected. Otherwise, the
default value of this timer is used.

The default value of this timer is also used by the UE in the following cases:

   -   ATTACH ACCEPT message or TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message is received without a value
       specified;

   -   the UE does not have a stored value for this timer;

   -   a new PLMN which is not in the list of equivalent PLMNs has been entered, the tracking area updating fails and
       the tracking area updating attempt counter is equal to 5; or

   -   a new PLMN which is not in the list of equivalent PLMNs has been entered, the attach procedure fails, the attach
       attempt counter is equal to 5 and no ATTACH REJECT message was received from the new PLMN.


5.3.7         Handling of the Local Emergency Numbers List and the Extended
              Local Emergency Numbers List
The Local Emergency Numbers List and the Extended Local Emergency Numbers list contain additional local
emergency numbers used by the serving network. These lists can be downloaded by the network to the UE at successful
registration and subsequent registration updates. There is only one Local Emergency Numbers List and only one
Extended Local Emergency Numbers list in the UE. The Local Emergency Numbers List can be updated with EMM
procedures if the UE is in S1 mode, with GMM and MM procedures if the UE is in A/Gb or Iu mode, and with 5GMM
procedures, as specified in 3GPP TS 24.501 [54], if UE is in N1 mode. The Extended Local Emergency Numbers List
can be updated with EMM procedures if the UE is in S1 mode and with 5GMM procedures, as specified in
3GPP TS 24.501 [54], if UE is in N1 mode.

3GPP TS 24.301 version 15.8.0 Release 15                   77                       ETSI TS 124 301 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


The UE shall use the stored Local Emergency Numbers List and the stored Extended Local Emergency Numbers List
received from the network in addition to the emergency numbers stored on the USIM or user equipment to detect that
the number dialled is an emergency number.

If the UE determines that the number dialled is an emergency number, the procedures specified in 3GPP TS 23.167 [45]
and 3GPP TS 24.229 [13D] are utilised to select a domain for the emergency session attempt.

If the domain selected for the emergency session attempt is the PS domain, then the UE shall perform the session
establishment procedures specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [13D] to initiate an emergency session.

If the domain selected for the emergency session attempt is the CS domain, then the UE shall use the stored Local
Emergency Numbers List, in addition to the emergency numbers stored on the USIM and the ME, to determine if the
call control entity of the UE specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 [13] is to send an EMERGENCY SETUP message or a
SETUP message to the network.

   NOTE 1: The checking of whether the dialled number is an emergency number and the determination of whether an
           emergency call is to be initiated in the CS domain, can end once a match is found. The Extended Local
           Emergency Numbers List does not apply when the CS domain is selected.

   NOTE 2: The user equipment can use the emergency numbers in each of the stored lists to assist the end user in
           determining whether the dialled number is intended for an emergency service or for another destination,
           e.g. a local directory service. The possible interactions with the end user are implementation specific.

   NOTE 3: A UE that supports procedures specified in 3GPP TS 24.302 [48], can get additional local emergency
           numbers through those procedures, which can be used based on operator policy, see
           3GPP TS 24.302 [48].

The network may send a Local Emergency Numbers List or an Extended Local Emergency Numbers List or both, in the
ATTACH ACCEPT or in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT messages, by including the Emergency number
list IE and the Extended emergency number list IE, respectively. The user equipment shall store the Local Emergency
Numbers List and the Extended Local Emergency Numbers List, as provided by the network. The Local Emergency
Numbers List stored in the user equipment shall be replaced on each receipt of the Emergency number list IE. The
Extended Local Emergency Numbers List stored in the user equipment shall be replaced on each receipt of the
Extended emergency number list IE. The received Local Emergency Numbers List or the received Extended Local
Emergency Numbers list or both shall be provided to the upper layers.

The emergency number(s) received in the Emergency number list IE are valid only in networks in the same country as
the PLMN from which this IE is received. If no Local Emergency Numbers List is contained in the ATTACH ACCEPT
or in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, then the stored Local Emergency Numbers List in the user
equipment shall be kept, except if the user equipment has successfully registered to a PLMN in a country different from
that of the PLMN that sent the list.

The emergency number(s) received in the Extended emergency number list IE are valid only in:

   -   networks in the same country as the PLMN from which this IE is received, if the Extended Emergency Number
       List Validity (EENLV) field within the Extended emergency number list IE indicates "Extended Local
       Emergency Numbers List is valid in the country of the PLMN from which this IE is received"; and

   -    the PLMN from which this IE is received, if the EENLV field within the Extended emergency number list IE
       indicates "Extended Local Emergency Numbers List is valid only in the PLMN from which this IE is received".

If no Extended Local Emergency Numbers List is contained in the ATTACH ACCEPT or in the TRACKING AREA
UPDATE ACCEPT message, and the registered PLMN has not changed, then the stored Extended Local Emergency
Numbers List in the user equipment shall be kept. If no Extended Local Emergency Numbers List is contained in the
ATTACH ACCEPT or in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, but the registered PLMN has changed,
then:

   -   if the last received indication in the EENLV field within the Extended emergency number list IE indicates
       "Extended Local Emergency Numbers List is valid only in the PLMN from which this IE is received", the stored
       Extended Local Emergency Numbers List in the user equipment shall be deleted; and

   -   if the last received indication in the EENLV field within the Extended emergency number list IE indicates
       "Extended Local Emergency Numbers List is valid in the country of the PLMN from which this IE is received"
       the list shall be kept except if the user equipment has successfully registered to a PLMN in a country different
       from that of the PLMN that sent the list.

   NOTE:      To prevent the misrouting of emergency calls, all operators within a country need to follow the regulation
              or agree on the setting of the Extended emergency number list IE in accordance to national agreement –
              either to indicate validity within a country or to indicate validity only within the PLMN.

The Local Emergency Numbers List and the Extended Local Emergency Numbers List shall be deleted at switch off
and removal of the USIM. The user equipment shall be able to store up to ten entries in the Local Emergency Numbers
List and up to twenty entries in the Extended Local Emergency Numbers List, received from the network.


5.3.7a        Specific requirements for UE configured to use timer T3245
The following requirement applies for an UE that is configured to use timer T3245 (see 3GPP TS 24.368 [15A] or
3GPP TS 31.102 [17]):

When the UE adds a PLMN identity to the "forbidden PLMN list", the "forbidden PLMNs for attach in S101 mode" list,
or the "forbidden PLMNs for GPRS service" list or sets the USIM as invalid for non-EPS services or EPS services or
both, and timer T3245 (see 3GPP TS 24.008 [13]) is not running, the UE shall start timer T3245 as specified in
3GPP TS 24.008 [13], subclause 4.1.1.6.

Upon expiry of the timer T3245, the UE shall erase the "forbidden PLMN list", the "forbidden PLMNs for GPRS
service" list, and the "forbidden PLMNs for attach in S101 mode" list and set the USIM to valid for non-EPS and EPS
services. When the lists are erased, the UE performs cell selection according to 3GPP TS 36.304 [21].

If the UE is switched off when the timer T3245 is running, the UE shall behave as follows when the UE is switched on
and the USIM in the UE remains the same:

   -   let t1 be the time remaining for T3245 timeout at switch off and let t be the time elapsed between switch off and
       switch on. If t1 is greater than t, then the timer shall be restarted with the value t1 – t. If t1 is equal to or less than
       t, then the UE will follow the behaviour as defined in the paragraph above upon expiry of the timer T3245. If the
       UE is not capable of determining t, then the UE shall restart the timer with the value t1.


5.3.7b        Specific requirements for UE when receiving non-integrity protected
              reject messages
This subclause specifies the requirements for a UE that is not configured to use timer T3245 (see
3GPP TS 24.368 [15A] or 3GPP TS 31.102 [17]) and receives an ATTACH REJECT, TRACKING AREA UPDATE
REJECT or SERVICE REJECT message without integrity protection with specific EMM causes.

   NOTE 1: Additional UE requirements for this case, requirements for other EMM causes, and requirements for the
           case when the UE receives an integrity protected reject message are specified in subclauses 5.5.1, 5.5.3
           and 5.6.1.

The UE may maintain a list of PLMN-specific attempt counters and a list of PLMN-specific PS-attempt counters (see
3GPP TS 24.008 [13]). The maximum number of possible entries in each list is implementation dependent.

Additionally, the UE may maintain one counter for "SIM/USIM considered invalid for non-GPRS services" events and
one counter for "SIM/USIM considered invalid for GPRS services" events (see 3GPP TS 24.008 [13]).

If the UE receives an ATTACH REJECT, TRACKING AREA UPDATE REJECT or SERVICE REJECT message
without integrity protection with EMM cause value #3, #6, #7, #8, #11, #12, #13, #14, #15 or #35 before the network
has established secure exchange of NAS messages for the NAS signalling connection, the UE shall start timer T3247
(see 3GPP TS 24.008 [13]) with a random value uniformly drawn from the range between 30 minutes and 60 minutes, if
the timer is not running, and take the following actions:

   1) if the EMM cause value received is #3, #6, #7 or #8, and

       a) if the UE maintains a counter for "SIM/USIM considered invalid for GPRS services" events and the counter
          has a value less than a UE implementation-specific maximum value, the UE shall:

          i) set the EPS update status to EU3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED (and shall store it according to
             subclause 5.1.3.3) and shall delete any GUTI, last visited registered TAI, TAI list and eKSI;

          -   delete the list of equivalent PLMNs;

              considered invalid for non-GPRS services" and the counter has a value less than a UE implementation-
              specific maximum value, increment the counter;

          -   if an attach or tracking area updating procedure was performed, reset the attach attempt counter or the

          ii) proceed as specified in subclauses 5.5.1, 5.5.3 and 5.6.1;

          -   increment the counter for "SIM/USIM considered invalid for GPRS services" events; and

          -   if the EMM cause value received is #3, #6 or #8, and if the UE maintains a counter for "SIM/USIM

              specific maximum value, increment the counter; and

      b) else the UE shall proceed as specified in subclauses 5.5.1, 5.5.3 and 5.6.1;

          subclause 5.1.3.3) and shall delete any GUTI, last visited registered TAI, TAI list and eKSI. The UE shall
          delete the list of equivalent PLMNs. Additionally, if an attach or tracking area updating procedure was
          performed, the UE shall reset the attach attempt counter or the tracking area updating attempt counter,
          respectively.

      -   if A/Gb mode or Iu mode is supported by the UE, the UE shall in addition handle the GMM parameters

       areas for roaming";

   -   set the USIM to valid for EPS services, if

       -   the UE does not maintain a counter for "SIM/USIM considered invalid for GPRS services" events; or

   -   if the UE maintains a list of PLMN-specific PS-attempt counters, for each PLMN-specific PS-attempt counter
       that has a value greater than zero and less than a UE implementation-specifc maximum value, remove the
       respective PLMN from the "forbidden PLMNs for GPRS service" list. If the resulting "forbidden PLMNs for

   -   if the UE is supporting A/Gb mode or Iu mode, handle the list of "forbidden location areas for regional provision
       of service" and the list of "forbidden location areas for roaming" as specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 [13] for the
       case when timer T3247 expires;

   -   if the UE is supporting A/Gb mode or Iu mode and maintains a list of "forbidden location areas for non-GPRS
       services" and a list of "forbidden location areas for GPRS services", handle these lists as specified in 3GPP TS
       24.008 [13] for the case when timer T3247 expires; and

   -   initiate an EPS attach procedure or tracking area updating procedure, if still needed, dependent on EMM state
       and EPS update status, or perform PLMN selection according to 3GPP TS 23.122 [6].

If the UE maintains a list of PLMN-specific attempt counters and PLMN-specific PS-attempt counters, when the UE is
switched off, the UE shall, for each PLMN-specific attempt counter that has a value greater than zero and less than the
UE implementation-specific maximum value, remove the respective PLMN from the forbidden PLMN list. When the
USIM is removed, the UE should perform this action.

   NOTE 2: If the respective PLMN was stored in the extension of the "forbidden PLMNs" list, then according to
           3GPP TS 23.122 [6] the UE will delete the contents of this extension when the USIM is removed.


5.3.8         Abnormal cases in the UE
The following abnormal case can be identified:

   a) EMM uplink message transmission failure indication by lower layers

       When it is specified in the relevant procedure that it is up to the UE implementation to rerun the ongoing
       procedure that triggered that procedure, the procedure can typically be re-initiated using a retransmission
       mechanism of the uplink message (the one that has previously failed to be transmitted) with new sequence
       number and message authentication code information thus avoiding to restart the whole procedure.

5.3.9         Handling of NAS level mobility management congestion control
The network may detect EMM signalling congestion and perform NAS level mobility management congestion control.
NAS level mobility management congestion control consists of general NAS level mobility management congestion
control and subscribed APN based congestion control.

Under general overload conditions the network may reject mobility management signalling requests from UEs as
specified in 3GPP TS 23.401 [10]. The network should not reject the following requests:

   -   requests for emergency bearer services;

   -   requests from UEs that were received via NAS signalling connections established with RRC establishment cause
       "High priority access AC 11 – 15"; and

   -   requests for CS fallback emergency call or 1xCS fallback emergency call.

When subscribed APN based mobility management congestion control is active for a particular APN, the network may
reject attach requests from UEs with a subscription to this APN.

In mobility management the network may detect NAS signalling congestion and start or stop performing the subscribed
APN based congestion control based on mobility management level criteria such as:

   -   rate of mobility management NAS messages from a group of UEs with a subscription to a particular APN
       exceeds or falls below certain thresholds; and/or

   -   setting in network management.

When the NAS level mobility management congestion control is active, the network may include a value for the
mobility management back-off timer T3346 in the reject messages. The UE starts the timer T3346 with the value
received in the mobility management reject messages. To avoid that large numbers of UEs simultaneously initiate
deferred requests, the network should select the value for the timer T3346 for the rejected UEs so that timeouts are not
synchronised.

For subscribed APN based congestion control the value of timer T3346 for a particular APN may be APN dependent.

If the timer T3346 is running when the UE enters state EMM-DEREGISTERED, the UE remains switched on, and the
USIM in the UE remains the same, then timer T3346 is kept running until it expires or it is stopped.

If the UE is switched off when the timer T3346 is running, the UE shall behave as follows when the UE is switched on
and the USIM in the UE remains the same:

   -   let t1 be the time remaining for T3346 timeout at switch off and let t be the time elapsed between switch off and
       switch on. If t1 is greater than t, then the timer shall be restarted with the value t1 – t. If t1 is equal to or less than
       t, then the timer need not be restarted. If the UE is not capable of determining t, then the UE shall restart the
       timer with the value t1; and

   -   if prior to switch off, timer T3346 was started due to a NAS request message (ATTACH REQUEST,

       mobility management requests as indicated in subclauses 5.5.1.2.6, 5.5.3.2.6 and 5.6.1.6.

If the UE enters a new PLMN while timer T3346 is running, and the new PLMN is not equivalent to the PLMN where
the UE started timer T3346, the UE shall stop timer T3346 when initiating mobility management procedures in the new
PLMN.

After change in TAI which is not part of TAI list, if the timer T3346 is running and EMM update status is EU1
UPDATED then UE shall set the EMM update status to EU2 NOT UPDATED and enter state EMM-
REGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-UPDATE.

5.3.9A        Handling of congestion control for transport of user data via the
              control plane
The network may activate congestion control for transport of user data via the control plane, as specified in
3GPP TS 23.401 [10].

If the congestion control for transport of user data via the control plane is active and if the UE has indicated support for
the control plane data back-off timer, the network shall include a value for the control plane data back-off timer T3448
in ATTACH ACCEPT, TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT, SERVICE ACCEPT or SERVICE REJECT message,
and shall store an control plane data back-off time on a per UE basis. The UE starts the timer T3448 with the value
informed in the message. To avoid that large numbers of UEs simultaneously initiate deferred requests, the network
should select the value for the timer T3448 for the informed UEs so that timeouts are not synchronised.

The network sends TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message or SERVICE ACCEPT message without T3448
value IE to stop the timer T3448 running in the UE as specified in subclause 5.5.3.2.4 and subclause 5.6.1.4.2.

Based on the stored control plane data back-off time for the UE, the network may reject the transfer of user data via the
control plane initiated by the UE.

While the timer T3448 is running, the UE in EMM-IDLE mode shall not initiate the transport of user data via the
control plane procedure (see subclause 6.6.4), except if the UE is allowed to use exception data reporting (see the
ExceptionDataReportingAllowed leaf of the NAS configuration MO in 3GPP TS 24.368 [15A] or the USIM file
EFNASCONFIG in 3GPP TS 31.102 [17]) and the user data is related to an exceptional event.

Upon entering the state EMM-DEREGISTERED or a new PLMN which is not equivalent to the PLMN where the UE
started the timer T3448, or upon being switched off while the timer T3448 is running, the UE shall stop the timer
T3448. For further criteria to stop of timer T3448, refer to subclause 5.5.3.2.4 and subclause 5.6.1.4.2.


5.3.10        Access class control
The network can restrict the access for certain groups of UEs by means of barring their access class.

The UE shall evaluate the access control information as specified in 3GPP TS 36.331 [22] for:

   -   Access Class Barring;

   -   Access Control for CSFB and Extended Access Barring (EAB);

   -   Access Control for Application specific Congestion control for Data Communication (ACDC), if the UE
       supports ACDC; and

   -   Access Barring.


5.3.11        Power saving mode
The UE can request the use of power saving mode (PSM) during an attach or tracking area updating procedure (see
3GPP TS 23.682 [11A] and 3GPP TS 23.401 [10]). The UE shall not request the use of PSM during:

   -   an attach for emergency bearer services procedure;

   -   an attach procedure for initiating a PDN connection for emergency bearer services with attach type not set to
       "EPS emergency attach";

   -   a tracking area updating procedure for initiating a PDN connection for emergency bearer services; or

   -   a tracking area updating procedure when the UE has a PDN connection established for emergency bearer
       services.

The network accepts the use of PSM by providing a specific value for timer T3324 when accepting the attach or
tracking area updating procedure. The UE may use PSM only if the network has provided the T3324 value IE during the
last attach or tracking area updating procedure with a value different from "deactivated".

   NOTE:      Timer T3324 is specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 [13].

3GPP TS 24.301 version 15.8.0 Release 15                  83                       ETSI TS 124 301 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


Upon expiry of the timer T3324 or if the T3324 value provided by the network is zero, the UE may deactivate the AS
layer and activate PSM by entering the state EMM-REGISTERED.NO-CELL-AVAILABLE if:

   a) the UE is not attached for emergency bearer services;

   b) the UE has no PDN connection for emergency bearer services;

   c) the UE is in EMM-IDLE mode; and

   d) in the EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE state.

If conditions a, b and c are fulfilled, but the UE is in a state other than EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE
when timer T3324 expires, the UE may activate PSM when the MS returns to state EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-
SERVICE.

A UE that has already been allocated timer T3324 with a value different from "deactivated" and the timer T3324 has
expired, may activate PSM if it receives an "Extended wait time" from lower layers.

When PSM is activated all NAS timers are stopped and associated procedures aborted except for T3412, T3346, T3396,
any backoff timers, and the timer T controlling the periodic search for HPLMN or EHPLMN or higher prioritized
PLMNs (see 3GPP TS 23.122 [6]).

If the UE is attached for emergency bearer services or has a PDN connection for emergency bearer services, the UE
shall not activate PSM.

The UE may deactivate PSM and activate the AS layerat any time. Upon deactivating PSM, the UE may initiate EMM
procedures (e.g. for the transfer of mobile originated signalling or user data).


5.3.12       Extended idle-mode DRX cycle
The UE may request the use of extended idle-mode DRX cycle (eDRX) during an attach or tracking area updating
procedure by including the extended DRX parameters IE (see 3GPP TS 23.682 [11A] and 3GPP TS 23.401 [10]). The
UE shall not request the use of eDRX during:

   -   an attach for emergency bearer services procedure; or

   -   a tracking area updating procedure for the UE attached for emergency bearer services.

The UE and the network may negotiate eDRX parameters during a tracking area updating procedure when the UE has a
PDN connection for emergency bearer services.

The network accepts the request to use the eDRX by providing the extended DRX parameters IE when accepting the
attach or the tracking area updating procedure. The UE shall use eDRX only if it received the extended DRX
parameters IE during the last attach or tracking area updating procedure and the UE does not have a PDN connection
for emergency bearer services.

   NOTE:     If the UE wants to keep using eDRX, the UE includes the extended DRX parameters IE in each attach or
             tracking area updating procedure.

If the UE received the extended DRX parameters IE during the last attach or tracking area updating procedure, upon
successful completion of the PDN disconnect procedure of the PDN connection for emergency bearer services or EPS
bearer context deactivation procedure of the EPS bearer context for emergency, the UE shall resume eDRX.

If the network has provided the extended DRX parameters IE during the last attach or tracking area updating procedure,
upon successful completion of the PDN disconnect procedure of the PDN connection for emergency bearer services or
EPS bearer context deactivation procedure of the EPS bearer context for emergency, the network shall resume eDRX.

If the UE or the network locally releases the PDN connection for emergency bearer service, the UE or the network shall
not use eDRX until the UE receives eDRX parameters during a tracking area updating procedure with EPS bearer
context synchronization or upon successful completion of a service request procedure.

If the UE did not receive the extended eDRX parameters IE, or if the UE has a PDN connection for emergency bearer
services, the UE shall use the stored UE specific DRX parameter, if available.

If the network did not accept the request to use eDRX, or if the UE has a PDN connection for emergency bearer
services, the network shall use the stored UE specific DRX parameter, if available.

If the network provided the extended DRX parameters IE which was different from the one requested by the UE and
also assigned a new GUTI for the UE as described in subclause 5.5.3.2.4 during the last tracking area updating
procedure, the network shall use the stored UE specific DRX parameter, if available, with the old GUTI and use the
eDRX provided by the network with the new GUTI until the old GUTI can be considered as invalid by the network (see
subclause 5.4.1.4).


5.3.13       Interaction between power saving mode and extended idle mode
             DRX cycle
The UE can request the use of both PSM and eDRX during an attach or tracking area update procedure but it is up to
the network to decide to enable none, one of them or both (see 3GPP TS 23.682 [11A] and 3GPP TS 23.401 [10]).

If the network accepts the use of both PSM (see subclause 5.3.11) and eDRX (see subclause 5.3.12), the extended DRX
parameters IE provided to the UE should allow for multiple paging occasions before the active timer expires.


5.3.14       Dedicated core network
The network may reject mobility management signalling requests from UEs due to dedicated core network as specified
in 3GPP TS 23.401 [10]. When the network rejects mobility management signalling requests due to dedicated core
network, the mechanism for general NAS level mobility management congestion control as specified in subclause 5.3.9
shall be followed.


5.3.15       CIoT EPS optimizations
CIoT EPS optimizations provide improved support of small data and SMS transfer. A UE supporting CIoT EPS
optimizations can indicate the CIoT network behaviour the UE can support and prefer to use during attach or tracking
area updating procedure (see 3GPP TS 23.401 [10]). The UE may indicate the support for control plane CIoT EPS
optimization, user plane CIoT EPS optimization, EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection, S1-U data transfer
and header compression (see subclause 9.9.3.34). The UE may also request to use SMS transfer without combined
attach procedure during the attach procedure. Furthermore, the UE may, separately from the indication of support,
indicate preference for control plane CIoT EPS optimization or user plane CIoT EPS optimization (see
subclause 9.9.3.0B). The indication of preference is also considered as the request to use.

   NOTE 1: The UE supporting control plane CIoT EPS optimization and S1-U data transfer but not user plane CIoT
           EPS optimization does not indicate preference for user plane CIoT EPS optimization.

The UE can be in NB-S1 mode or WB-S1 mode when requesting the use of CIoT EPS optimizations during an attach or
tracking area updating procedure. A UE in NB-S1 mode always indicates support for control plane CIoT EPS
optimization. A UE in NB-S1 mode can also request SMS transfer without combined procedure by using the normal
attach or tracking area updating procedure (see subclause 5.5.1 and 5.5.3).

In NB-S1 mode, the UE, when requesting the use of CIoT EPS optimization, does not:

   -   request an attach for emergency bearer services procedure;

   -   request an attach procedure for initiating a PDN connection for emergency bearer services with attach type not
       set to "EPS emergency attach"; or

   -   indicate voice domain preference and UE's usage setting.

The network does not indicate to the UE support of emergency bearer services when the UE is in NB-S1 mode (see
subclause 5.5.1.2.4 and 5.5.3.2.4).

The control plane CIoT EPS optimization enables support of efficient transport of user data (IP, non-IP) or SMS
messages over control plane via the MME without triggering data radio bearer establishment. The support of control
plane CIoT EPS optimization is mandatory for the network in NB-S1 mode and optional in WB-S1 mode. Optional
header compression of IP data can be applied to IP PDN type PDN connections that are configured to support header
compression.

3GPP TS 24.301 version 15.8.0 Release 15                   85                       ETSI TS 124 301 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


The user plane CIoT EPS optimization enables support for change from EMM-IDLE mode to EMM-CONNECTED
mode without the need for using the service request procedure (see subclause 5.3.1.3).

If the UE indicates support of EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection in the attach request, the UE may include
an ESM DUMMY MESSAGE instead of a PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message as part of the attach procedure.
If the EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is supported by the network, the UE and the network can at any
time release all the PDN connections and the UE still remains EPS attached.

   NOTE 2: For both the UE and the network, the term "EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection" is equivalent
           to the term "EPS attach without PDN connectivity" as specified in 3GPP TS 23.401 [10].

In NB-S1 mode, if the UE indicates "SMS only" during a normal attach or tracking area updating procedure, the MME
supporting CIoT EPS optimisations provides SMS so that the UE is not required to perform a combined attach or
tracking area updating procedure.

If the UE supports user plane CIoT EPS optimization, it shall also support S1-U data transfer.

If the UE indicates support of one or more CIoT EPS optimizations and the network supports one or more CIoT EPS
optimizations and decides to accept the attach or tracking area update request, the network indicates the supported CIoT
EPS optimizations to the UE per TAI list when accepting the UE request. Network indication of support is interpreted
by the UE as the acceptance to use the respective feature. After completion of the attach or tracking area updating
procedure, the UE and the network can then use the accepted CIoT EPS optimizations for the transfer of user data (IP,
non-IP and SMS).

If the UE and the network support both the control plane CIoT EPS optimization and S1-U data transfer, then when
receiving the UE's request for a PDN connection, the MME decides whether the PDN connection should be SCEF PDN
connection or SGi PDN connection as specified in 3GPP TS 23.401 [10]:

   -   if SCEF PDN connection is to be established for non-IP data type, the MME shall include Control plane only
       indication for the requested PDN connection;

   -   if SGi PDN connection is to be established and existing SGi PDN connections for this UE were established with
       Control plane only indication, the MME shall include Control plane only indication for the newly requested SGi
       PDN connection;

   -   if SGi PDN connection is to be established and existing SGi PDN connections for this UE were established
       without Control plane only indication, the MME shall not include Control plane only indication for the newly
       requested SGi PDN connection; and

   -   if SGi PDN connection is to be established and no SGi PDN connection for this UE exists, the MME determine
       whether to include Control plane only indication for the requested SGi PDN connection based on local policies,
       the UE's preferred CIoT network behaviour and the supported CIoT network behaviour.

If the network supports user plane CIoT EPS optimization, it shall also support S1-U data transfer.

Broadcast system information may provide information about support of CIoT EPS optimizations (see
3GPP TS 36.331 [22]). At reception of new broadcast system information, the lower layers deliver it to the EMM layer
in the UE. The information provided by lower layers is per PLMN and used by the UE to determine whether certain
CIoT EPS optimizations are supported in the cell.

The UE shall not attempt to use CIoT EPS optimizations which are indicated as not supported.

In NB-S1 mode, when the UE requests the lower layer to establish a RRC connection and the UE requests the use of
EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection or user plane CIoT EPS optimization, the UE shall pass an indication of
the requested CIoT EPS optimizations to the lower layers. If the UE requests the use of S1-U data transfer without user
plane CIoT optimization, then the UE shall also pass an indication of user plane CIoT EPS optimization to lower layers.

In WB-S1 mode, when the UE requests the lower layer to establish a RRC connection and the UE requests the use of
EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection, control plane CIoT EPS optimization or user plane CIoT EPS
optimization, the UE shall pass an indication of the requested CIoT EPS optimizations to the lower layers.

5.3.16        Restriction on use of enhanced coverage
In order to deal with use of extensive resources from the network, the operator may prevent specific subscribers from
using enhanced coverage (see 3GPP TS 23.401 [10]). When in NB-S1 mode, the UE shall indicate support for
restriction on use of enhanced coverage. When in WB-S1 mode, the UE supporting either CE mode A or CE mode B
shall indicate support for restriction on use of enhanced coverage. The UE supporting restriction on use of enhanced
coverage indicates its support for restriction on use of enhanced coverage in the ATTACH REQUEST and TRACKING
AREA UPDATE REQUEST message. If the UE supports restriction on use of enhanced coverage, the MME indicates
whether the use of enhanced coverage is restricted or not in the ATTACH ACCEPT message and TRACKING AREA
UPDATE ACCEPT message (see subclause 5.5.1.2 and subclause 5.5.3.2). If the use of enhanced coverage is restricted,
the UE shall not use enhanced coverage in the registered PLMN and in any PLMN which is in the list of equivalent
PLMNs.

If the UE supports CE mode B and the network determines that

   -   the use of enhanced coverge is not restricted for the UE; or

   -   CE mode B is not restricted for the UE;

the applicable NAS timer values shall be calculated by the network as described in subclause 4.8.


5.3.17        Service Gap Control
The network may control the frequency UEs can transit from EMM-IDLE mode to EMM-CONNECTED mode via the
service gap control (SGC) as specified in 3GPP TS 23.401 [10]. If the network supports service gap control (SGC)
feature and the service gap time value is available in the EMM context of the UE, the MME shall consider SGC as
active for the UE.

The UE and the network negotiate usage of the service gap control (SGC) feature during the attach and tracking area
update procedures:

   -   the UE supporting service gap control indicates its support for service gap control in the ATTACH REQUEST
       and TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message. If the UE supports service gap control and the the SGC
       is active for the UE, the MME shall include service gap timer T3447 value in the ATTACH ACCEPT message
       and TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message (see subclause 5.5.1.2 and subclause 5.5.3.2). The UE
       shall store the service gap time value; and

   -   for UEs that do not support the optional SGC feature when the network rejects mobility management signalling
       requests due to service gap control is active in the network, the mechanism for general NAS level mobility
       management congestion control as specified in subclause 5.3.9 applies.

The UE shall start the SGC timer T3447 when the NAS signalling connection is released and if:

   -   the UE supports SGC feature, and the service gap timer value is available in the UE and does not indicate zero;
       and

   -   the NAS signalling connection released was not established for:

       -   paging;

       -   attach requests without PDN connection request; or

       -   tracking area update requests without "active" or "signalling active" flag set.

If the SGC is active in the network, after the UE transitions from EMM-CONNECTED mode to EMM-IDLE mode
except when the UE was in EMM-CONNECTED mode due to:

   -   paging;

   -   attach requests without PDN connection request; or

   -   tracking area update requests without "active" or "signalling active" flag set,

the network shall start the SGC timer T3447:

   -   with the service gap time value available in the EMM context minus 4 minutes, if the UE supports SGC feature
       and the service gap time value has been sent to the UE with a non-zero value; or

   -   with the service gap time value available in the EMM context if the UE does not support SGC feature.

When the SGC timer is running, the network allows:

   -   attach requests for emergency bearer services;

   -   attach requests without PDN connection request;

   -   tracking area update requests without "active" or "signalling active" flag set;

   -   requests from UEs that were received via NAS signalling connections established with RRC establishment cause
       "High priority access AC 11 – 15";

   -   mobile terminated service requests triggered by paging and subsequent MO signalling or MO data, if any, until
       the UE enters EMM-IDLE mode.

The UE or the network with a running service gap timer shall keep the timer running when the UE transits from EMM-
IDLE mode to EMM-CONNECTED mode.

   NOTE:      If the UE transitions from EMM-IDLE mode to EMM-CONNECTED mode due to attach request without
              PDN connection request or tracking area update request without "active" or "signalling active" flag set,
              the UE initiates no further MO signalling except for tracking area update request without "active" or
              "signalling active" flag set until the UE receives network-initiated signalling (e.g. DOWNLINK NAS
              TRANSPORT message for MT SMS) or MT data over user plane, or after the UE has moved to EMM-
              IDLE state and the service gap timer is not running.

If the timer T3447 is running when the UE enters state EMM-DEREGISTERED, the UE remains switched on, and the
USIM in the UE remains the same, then timer T3447 is kept running until it expires.

If the UE is switched off when the timer T3447 is running, the UE shall behave as follows when the UE is switched on
and the USIM in the UE remains the same:

   -   let t1 be the time remaining for T3447 timeout at switch off and let t be the time elapsed between switch off and
       switch on. If t1 is greater than t, then the timer shall be restarted with the value t1 – t. If t1 is equal to or less than
       t, then the timer need not be restarted. If the UE is not capable of determining t, then the UE shall restart the
       timer with the value t1.


5.4           EMM common procedures
5.4.1         GUTI reallocation procedure

5.4.1.1           General
The purpose of the GUTI reallocation procedure is to allocate a GUTI and optionally to provide a new TAI list or a new
DCN-ID or both to a particular UE.

The reallocation of a GUTI is performed by the unique procedure defined in this subclause. This procedure can only be
initiated by the MME in state EMM-REGISTERED.

The GUTI can also be implicitly reallocated at attach or tracking area updating procedures. The implicit reallocation of
a GUTI is described in the subclauses which specify these procedures (see subclause 5.5.1 and 5.5.3).

The PLMN identity in the GUTI indicates the current registered PLMN.

   NOTE 1: The GUTI reallocation procedure is usually performed in ciphered mode.

   NOTE 2: Normally, the GUTI reallocation will take place in conjunction with another mobility management
           procedure, e.g. as part of tracking area updating.

5.4.1.2          GUTI reallocation initiation by the network
The MME shall initiate the GUTI reallocation procedure by sending a GUTI REALLOCATION COMMAND message
to the UE and starting the timer T3450 (see example in figure 5.4.1.2.1).

The GUTI REALLOCATION COMMAND message shall include a GUTI and may include a TAI list or a DCN-ID or
both.

5.4.1.3          GUTI reallocation completion by the UE
Upon receipt of the GUTI REALLOCATION COMMAND message, the UE shall store the GUTI and the TAI list and
the DCN-ID, if provided, and send a GUTI REALLOCATION COMPLETE message to the MME. The UE considers
the new GUTI as valid and the old GUTI as invalid. If the UE receives a new TAI list in the GUTI REALLOCATION
COMMAND message, the UE shall consider the new TAI list as valid and the old TAI list as invalid; otherwise, the UE
shall consider the old TAI list as valid.

If the GUTI REALLOCATION COMMAND message contains the DCN-ID IE, then the UE shall store the included
DCN-ID value together with the PLMN code of the registered PLMN in a DCN-ID list in a non-volatile memory in the
ME as specified in annex C.

5.4.1.4          GUTI reallocation completion by the network
Upon receipt of the GUTI REALLOCATION COMPLETE message, the MME shall stop the timer T3450 and consider
the new GUTI as valid and the old GUTI as invalid. If a new TAI list is provided in the GUTI REALLOCATION
COMMAND message, the MME shall consider the new TAI list as valid and the old TAI list as invalid.

5.4.1.5          Abnormal cases in the UE
The following abnormal cases can be identified:

   a) Transmission failure of GUTI REALLOCATION COMPLETE message indication with TAI change from lower
      layers

      If the current TAI is not in the TAI list, the GUTI reallocation procedure shall be aborted and a tracking area
      updating procedure shall be initiated.

      If the current TAI is still part of the TAI list, it is up to the UE implementation how to re-run the ongoing
      procedure that triggered the GUTI reallocation procedure.

   b) Transmission failure of GUTI REALLOCATION COMPLETE message indication without TAI change from
      lower layers

      It is up to the UE implementation how to re-run the ongoing procedure that triggered the GUTI reallocation
      procedure.

5.4.1.6          Abnormal cases on the network side
The following abnormal cases can be identified:




                                                          ETSI
3GPP TS 24.301 version 15.8.0 Release 15                    89                        ETSI TS 124 301 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


   a) Lower layer failure

      If a lower layer failure is detected before the GUTI REALLOCATION COMPLETE message is received, the old
      and the new GUTI shall be considered as valid until the old GUTI can be considered as invalid by the network.
      If a new TAI list was provided in the GUTI REALLOCATION COMMAND message, the old and new TAI list
      shall also be considered as valid until the old TAI list can be considered as invalid by the network.

      During this period the network:

      -   may first use the old S-TMSI from the old GUTI for paging within the area defined by the old TAI list for an
          implementation dependent number of paging attempts for network originated transactions. If a new TAI list
          was provided with old GUTI in the GUTI REALLOCATION COMMAND message, the new TAI list should
          also be used for paging. Upon response from the UE, the network may re-initiate the GUTI reallocation. If
          the response is received from a tracking area within the old and new TAI list, the network shall re-initiate the
          GUTI reallocation. If no response is received to the paging attempts, the network may use the new S-TMSI
          from the new GUTI for paging for an implementation dependent number of paging attempts. In this case, if a
          new TAI list was provided with new GUTI in the GUTI REALLOCAITON COMMAND message, the new
          TAI list shall be used instead of the old TAI list. Upon response from the UE the network shall consider the
          new GUTI as valid and the old GUTI as invalid. If no response is received to the paging attempts, the
          network may use the IMSI for paging for an implementation dependent number of paging attempts;

   NOTE 1: Paging with IMSI causes the UE to re-attach as described in subclause 5.6.2.2.2.

      -   shall consider the new GUTI as valid if it is used by the UE and, additionally, the new TAI list as valid if it
          was provided with this GUTI in the GUTI REALLOCATION COMMAND message;

      -   may use the identification procedure followed by a new GUTI reallocation if the UE uses the old GUTI; and

      -   if the network accepted to use eDRX for the UE, may determine the next paging window from both old
          GUTI and new GUTI, and may first use the S-TMSI from the GUTI which led the first eDRX for paging. If
          no response is received to the paging attempts for the first eDRX, the network may use the other S-TMSI
          from the other GUTI which led the second eDRX for paging. For this paging procedure, the network shall
          start timer T3415 long enough to care the paging attempts for both eDRXs.

   NOTE 2: If the second eDRX comes during the first eDRX ongoing, the paging attempts for the second eDRX can
           be initiated with stopping further paging attempts for the first eDRX.

   b) Expiry of timer T3450

      The GUTI reallocation procedure is supervised by the timer T3450. The network shall, on the first expiry of
      timer T3450, reset and restart timer T3450 and shall retransmit the GUTI REALLOCATION COMMAND. This
      retransmission is repeated four times, i.e. on the fifth expiry of timer T3450, the network shall abort the
      reallocation procedure and shall follow the rules described for case a above.

   c) GUTI reallocation and attach procedure collision

      If the network receives an ATTACH REQUEST message before the ongoing GUTI reallocation procedure has
      been completed the network shall proceed with the attach procedure after deletion of the EMM context.

   d) GUTI reallocation and UE initiated detach procedure collision

      If the network receives a DETACH REQUEST message before the ongoing GUTI reallocation procedure has
      been completed, the network shall abort the GUTI reallocation procedure and shall progress the detach
      procedure.

   e) GUTI reallocation and tracking area updating procedure collision

      If the network receives a TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message before the ongoing GUTI
      reallocation procedure has been completed, the network shall abort the GUTI reallocation procedure and shall
      progress the tracking area updating procedure. The network may then perform a new GUTI reallocation.

   f) GUTI reallocation and service request procedure collision

      If the network receives an EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST message for CS fallback or 1xCS fallback before
      the ongoing GUTI reallocation procedure has been completed, the network shall progress both procedures.

   g) Lower layer indication of non-delivered NAS PDU due to handover

       If the GUTI REALLOCATION COMMAND message could not be delivered due to an intra MME handover
       and the target TA is included in the TAI list, then upon successful completion of the intra MME handover the
       MME shall retransmit the GUTI REALLOCATION COMMAND message. If a failure of the handover
       procedure is reported by the lower layer and the S1 signalling connection exists, the MME shall retransmit the
       GUTI REALLOCATION COMMAND message.

If there is a different new GUTI and optionally a new TAI list included in a subsequent GUTI REALLOCATION
COMMAND message, the UE always regards the newest GUTI and the newest TAI list as valid for the recovery time.


5.4.2         Authentication procedure

5.4.2.1          General
The purpose of the EPS authentication and key agreement (AKA) procedure is to provide mutual authentication
between the user and the network and to agree on a key KASME (see 3GPP TS 33.401 [19]). The cases when the EPS
AKA procedure should be used are defined in 3GPP TS 33.401 [19].

The EPS AKA procedure is always initiated and controlled by the network. However, the UE can reject the EPS
authentication challenge sent by the network.

The UE shall proceed with an EPS authentication challenge only if a USIM is present.

A partial native EPS security context is established in the UE and the network when an EPS authentication is
successfully performed. During a successful EPS authentication procedure, the CK and IK are computed by the USIM.
CK and IK are then used by the ME as key material to compute a new key, KASME. KASME is stored in the EPS security
contexts (see 3GPP TS 33.401 [19]) of both the network and in the volatile memory of the ME while attached to the
network, and is the root for the EPS integrity protection and ciphering key hierarchy.

5.4.2.2          Authentication initiation by the network
When a NAS signalling connection exists, the network can initiate an authentication procedure at any time. For
restrictions applicable after handover or inter-system handover to S1 mode see subclause 5.5.3.2.3.

The network initiates the authentication procedure by sending an AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message to the UE
and starting the timer T3460 (see example in figure 5.4.2.2.1). The AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message contains
the parameters necessary to calculate the authentication response (see 3GPP TS 33.401 [19]).

If an eKSI is contained in an initial NAS message during an EMM procedure, the network shall include a different eKSI
value in the AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message when it initiates an authentication procedure.

5.4.2.3           Authentication response by the UE
The UE shall respond to an AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message. With the exception of the cases described in
subclause 5.4.2.6, the UE shall process the authentication challenge data and respond with an AUTHENTICATION
RESPONSE message to the network.

Upon a successful EPS authentication challenge, the UE shall determine the PLMN identity to be used for the
calculation of the new KASME from the authentication challenge data according to the following rules:

   a) When the UE moves from EMM-IDLE mode to EMM-CONNECTED mode, until the first handover, the UE
      shall use the PLMN identity of the selected PLMN; and

   b) After handover or inter-system handover to S1 ,mode,

       -   if the target cell is not a shared network cell, the UE shall use the PLMN identity received as part of the
           broadcast system information;

       -   if the target cell is a shared network cell and the UE has a valid GUTI, the UE shall use the PLMN identity
           that is part of the GUTI; and

       -   if the target cell is a shared network cell, the UE does not have a valid GUTI and,

       -   the EPS authentication challenge is performed after inter-system handover from A/Gb mode to S1 mode or
           from Iu mode to S1 mode and the UE has a valid P-TMSI and RAI, the UE shall use the PLMN identity that
           is part of the RAI; or

           -   the EPS authentication challenge is performed after inter-system handover from N1 mode to S1 mode and
               the UE has a valid 5G-GUTI, the UE shall use the PLMN identity that is part of the 5G-GUTI.

Upon a successful EPS authentication challenge, the new KASME calculated from the authentication challenge data shall
be stored in a new EPS security context in the volatile memory of the ME.

The USIM will compute the authentication response (RES) using the authentication challenge data received from the
ME, and pass RES to the ME.

In order to avoid a synchronisation failure, when the UE receives an AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message, the UE
shall store the received RAND together with the RES returned from the USIM in the volatile memory of the ME. When
the UE receives a subsequent AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message, if the stored RAND value is equal to the new
received value in the AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message, then the ME shall not pass the RAND to the USIM,
but shall send the AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message with the stored RES. If there is no valid stored RAND in
the ME or the stored RAND is different from the new received value in the AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message,
the ME shall pass the RAND to the USIM, shall override any previously stored RAND and RES with the new ones and
start, or reset and restart timer T3416.

The RAND and RES values stored in the ME shall be deleted and timer T3416, if running, shall be stopped:

   -   upon receipt of a

       -   SECURITY MODE COMMAND,

       -   SERVICE REJECT,

       -   TRACKING AREA UPDATE REJECT,

       -   TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT, or

       -   AUTHENTICATION REJECT message;

   -   upon expiry of timer T3416;

   -   if the UE enters the EMM state EMM-DEREGISTERED or EMM-NULL; or

   -   if the UE enters EMM-IDLE mode.

5.4.2.4           Authentication completion by the network
Upon receipt of an AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message, the network stops the timer T3460 and checks the
correctness of RES (see 3GPP TS 33.401 [19]).

If the authentication procedure has been completed successfully and the related eKSI is stored in the EPS security
context of the network, the network shall include a different eKSI value in the AUTHENTICATION REQUEST
message when it initiates a new authentication procedure.

Upon receipt of an AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message, the network stops the timer T3460. In the case where the
EMM cause #21 "synch failure" is received, the core network may renegotiate with the HSS/AuC and provide the UE
with new authentication parameters.

5.4.2.5           Authentication not accepted by the network
If the authentication response (RES) returned by the UE is not valid, the network response depends upon the type of
identity used by the UE in the initial NAS message, that is:

   -   if the GUTI was used; or

   -   if the IMSI was used.

If the GUTI was used, the network should initiate an identification procedure. If the IMSI given by the UE during the
identification procedure differs from the IMSI the network had associated with the GUTI, the authentication should be
restarted with the correct parameters. Otherwise, if the IMSI provided by the UE is the same as the IMSI stored in the
network (i.e. authentication has really failed), the network should send an AUTHENTICATION REJECT message to
the UE.

If the IMSI was used for identification in the initial NAS message, or the network decides not to initiate the
identification procedure after an unsuccessful authentication procedure, the network should send an
AUTHENTICATION REJECT message to the UE.

Upon receipt of an AUTHENTICATION REJECT message,

   a) if the message has been successfully integrity checked by the NAS, the UE shall set the update status to EU3
      ROAMING NOT ALLOWED, delete the stored GUTI, TAI list, last visited registered TAI and KSIASME. The
      USIM shall be considered invalid until switching off the UE or the UICC containing the USIM is removed. If the
      UE maintains a counter for "SIM/USIM considered invalid for GPRS services", then the UE shall set this
      counter to UE implementation-specific maximum value. If the UE maintains a counter for "SIM/USIM
      considered invalid for non-GPRS services", then the UE shall set this counter to UE implementation-specific
      maximum value.

       If A/Gb or Iu mode is supported by the UE, the UE shall in addition handle the GMM parameters GMM state,
       GPRS update status, P-TMSI, P-TMSI signature, RAI and GPRS ciphering key sequence number and the MM
       parameters update status, TMSI, LAI and ciphering key sequence number as specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 [13]
       for the case when the authentication and ciphering procedure is not accepted by the network; and

   b) if the message is received without integrity protection, the UE shall start timer T3247 (see 3GPP TS 24.008 [13])
      with a random value uniformly drawn from the range between 30 minutes and 60 minutes, if the timer is not
      running (see subclause 5.3.7b). Additionally, the UE shall:

       -   if the UE maintains a counter for "SIM/USIM considered invalid for GPRS services" events and the counter
           has a value less than a UE implementation-specific maximum value, proceed as specified in subclause 5.3.7b,
           list item 1a for the case that the EMM cause value received is #3; and

       -   otherwise proceed as specified under list item a above for the case that the message has been successfully
           integrity checked.

If the AUTHENTICATION REJECT message is received by the UE, the UE shall abort any EMM signalling
procedure, stop any of the timers T3410, T3416, T3417, T3430, T3418 or T3420 (if they were running) and enter state
EMM-DEREGISTERED.

Depending on local requirements or operator preference for emergency bearer services, if the UE has a PDN connection
for emergency bearer services established or is establishing a PDN connection for emergency bearer services, the MME

need not follow the procedures specified for the authentication failure in the present subclause. The MME may continue
a current EMM specific procedure or PDN connectivity request procedure. Upon completion of the authentication
procedure, if not initiated as part of another procedure, or upon completion of the EMM procedure or PDN connectivity
request procedure, the MME shall deactivate all non-emergency EPS bearers, if any, by initiating an EPS bearer context
deactivation procedure. The network shall consider the UE to be attached for emergency bearer services only.

5.4.2.6          Authentication not accepted by the UE
In an EPS authentication challenge, the UE shall check the authenticity of the core network by means of the AUTN
parameter received in the AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message. This enables the UE to detect a false network.

During an EPS authentication procedure, the UE may reject the core network due to an incorrect AUTN parameter (see
3GPP TS 33.401 [19]). This parameter contains three possible causes for authentication failure:

   a) MAC code failure:

          If the UE finds the MAC code (supplied by the core network in the AUTN parameter) to be invalid, the UE
          shall send an AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message to the network, with the EMM cause #20 "MAC
          failure". The UE shall then follow the procedure described in subclause 5.4.2.7, item c.

   b) Non-EPS authentication unacceptable:

          If the UE finds that the "separation bit" in the AMF field of AUTN supplied by the core network is 0, the UE
          shall send an AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message to the network, with the EMM cause #26 "non-EPS
          authentication unacceptable" (see subclause 6.1.1 in 3GPP TS 33.401 [19]). The UE shall then follow the
          procedure described in subclause 5.4.2.7, item d.

   c) SQN failure:

          If the UE finds the SQN (supplied by the core network in the AUTN parameter) to be out of range, the UE
          shall send an AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message to the network, with the EMM cause #21 "synch
          failure" and a re-synchronization token AUTS provided by the USIM (see 3GPP TS 33.102 [18]). The UE
          shall then follow the procedure described in subclause 5.4.2.7, item e.

If the UE returns an AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message to the network, the UE shall delete any previously stored
RAND and RES and shall stop timer T3416, if running.

If the UE has a PDN connection for emergency bearer services established or is establishing such a PDN connection,
additional UE requirements are specified in subclause 5.4.2.7, under "for items c, d, e".

5.4.2.7          Abnormal cases
   a) Lower layer failure:

      Upon detection of lower layer failure before the AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message is received, the
      network shall abort the procedure.

   b) Expiry of timer T3460:

      The network shall, on the first expiry of the timer T3460, retransmit the AUTHENTICATION REQUEST
      message and shall reset and start timer T3460. This retransmission is repeated four times, i.e. on the fifth expiry
      of timer T3460, the network shall abort the authentication procedure and any ongoing EMM specific procedure
      and release the NAS signalling connection.

   c) Authentication failure (EMM cause #20 "MAC failure"):

      The UE shall send an AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message, with EMM cause #20 "MAC failure" according
      to subclause 5.4.2.6, to the network and start timer T3418 (see example in figure 5.4.2.7.1). Furthermore, the UE
      shall stop any of the retransmission timers that are running (e.g. T3410, T3417, T3421 or T3430). Upon the first
      receipt of an AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message from the UE with EMM cause #20 "MAC failure", the
      network may initiate the identification procedure described in subclause 5.4.4. This is to allow the network to
      obtain the IMSI from the UE. The network may then check that the GUTI originally used in the authentication
      challenge corresponded to the correct IMSI. Upon receipt of the IDENTITY REQUEST message from the
      network, the UE shall send the IDENTITY RESPONSE message.

   NOTE 1: Upon receipt of an AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message from the UE with EMM cause #20 "MAC
           failure", the network may also terminate the authentication procedure (see subclause 5.4.2.5).

      If the GUTI/IMSI mapping in the network was incorrect, the network should respond by sending a new
      AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message to the UE. Upon receiving the new AUTHENTICATION REQUEST
      message from the network, the UE shall stop the timer T3418, if running, and then process the challenge
      information as normal. If the GUTI/IMSI mapping in the network was correct, the network should terminate the
      authentication procedure by sending an AUTHENTICATION REJECT message (see subclause 5.4.2.5).

      If the network is validated successfully (an AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message that contains a valid SQN
      and MAC is received), the UE shall send the AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message to the network and
      shall start any retransmission timers (e.g. T3410, T3417, T3421 or T3430) if they were running and stopped
      when the UE received the first failed AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message.

      If the UE receives the second AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message while T3418 is running, and the MAC
      value cannot be resolved, the UE shall follow the procedure specified in this subclause, item c, starting again
      from the beginning, or if the message contains a UMTS authentication challenge, the UE shall follow the
      procedure specified in item d. If the SQN is invalid, the UE shall proceed as specified in item e.

      It can be assumed that the source of the authentication challenge is not genuine (authentication not accepted by
      the UE) if any of the following occur:

      -   the timer T3418 expires;

      -   the UE detects any combination of the authentication failures: EMM causes #20 "MAC failure", #21 "synch
          failure" or #26 "non-EPS authentication unacceptable", during three consecutive authentication challenges.
          The authentication challenges shall be considered as consecutive only, if the authentication challenges
          causing the second and third authentication failure are received by the UE, while the timer T3418 or T3420
          started after the previous authentication failure is running.

      The UE shall stop timer T3418, if the timer is running and the UE enters EMM-IDLE mode, e.g. upon detection
      of a lower layer failure, release of the NAS signalling connection, or as the result of an inter-system handover to
      A/Gb mode or Iu mode.

      When it has been deemed by the UE that the source of the authentication challenge is not genuine (i.e.
      authentication not accepted by the UE), the UE shall proceed as described in item f.

3GPP TS 24.301 version 15.8.0 Release 15                   95                        ETSI TS 124 301 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


      The UE shall send an AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message, with EMM cause #26 "non-EPS authentication
      unacceptable", to the network and start the timer T3418 (see example in figure 5.4.2.7.1). Furthermore, the UE
      shall stop any of the retransmission timers that are running (e.g. T3410, T3417, T3421 or T3430). Upon the first
      receipt of an AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message from the UE with EMM cause #26 "non-EPS
      authentication unacceptable", the network may initiate the identification procedure described in subclause 5.4.4.
      This is to allow the network to obtain the IMSI from the UE. The network may then check that the GUTI
      originally used in the authentication challenge corresponded to the correct IMSI. Upon receipt of the IDENTITY
      REQUEST message from the network, the UE shall send the IDENTITY RESPONSE message.

   NOTE 2: Upon receipt of an AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message from the UE with EMM cause #26 "non-
           EPS authentication unacceptable", the network may also terminate the authentication procedure (see
           subclause 5.4.2.5).

      If the GUTI/IMSI mapping in the network was incorrect, the network should respond by sending a new
      AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message to the UE. Upon receiving the new AUTHENTICATION REQUEST
      message from the network, the UE shall stop the timer T3418, if running, and then process the challenge
      information as normal. If the GUTI/IMSI mapping in the network was correct, the network should terminate the
      authentication procedure by sending an AUTHENTICATION REJECT message (see subclause 5.4.2.5).

      It can be assumed that the source of the authentication challenge is not genuine (authentication not accepted by
      the UE) if any of the following occur:

      -   the timer T3418 expires;

      -   the UE detects any combination of the authentication failures: EMM causes #20 "MAC failure", #21 "synch
          failure" or #26 "non-EPS authentication unacceptable", during three consecutive authentication challenges.
          The authentication challenges shall be considered as consecutive only, if the authentication challenges
          causing the second and third authentication failure are received by the UE, while the timer T3418 or T3420
          started after the previous authentication failure is running.

      The UE shall stop timer T3420, if the timer is running and the UE enters EMM-IDLE mode, e.g. upon detection
      of a lower layer failure, release of the NAS signalling connection, or as the result of an inter-system handover to
      A/Gb mode or Iu mode.

      When it has been deemed by the UE that the source of the authentication challenge is not genuine (i.e.
      authentication not accepted by the UE), the UE shall proceed as described in item f.

   e) Authentication failure (EMM cause #21 "synch failure"):

      The UE shall send an AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message, with EMM cause #21 "synch failure", to the
      network and start the timer T3420 (see example in figure 5.4.2.7.2). Furthermore, the UE shall stop any of the
      retransmission timers that are running (e.g. T3410, T3417, T3421 or T3430). Upon the first receipt of an
      AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message from the UE with the EMM cause #21 "synch failure", the network
      shall use the returned AUTS parameter from the authentication failure parameter IE in the AUTHENTICATION
      FAILURE message, to re-synchronise. The re-synchronisation procedure requires the MME to delete all unused
      authentication vectors for that IMSI and obtain new vectors from the HSS. When re-synchronisation is complete,
      the network shall initiate the authentication procedure. Upon receipt of the AUTHENTICATION REQUEST
      message, the UE shall stop the timer T3420, if running.

   NOTE 3: Upon receipt of two consecutive AUTHENTICATION FAILURE messages from the UE with EMM
           cause #21 "synch failure", the network may terminate the authentication procedure by sending an
           AUTHENTICATION REJECT message.

      If the network is validated successfully (a new AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message is received which
      contains a valid SQN and MAC) while T3420 is running, the UE shall send the AUTHENTICATION
      RESPONSE message to the network and shall start any retransmission timers (e.g. T3410, T3417, T3421 or
      T3430), if they were running and stopped when the UE received the first failed AUTHENTICATION
      REQUEST message.

      If the UE receives the second AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message while T3420 is running, and the MAC
      value cannot be resolved, the UE shall follow the procedure specified in item c or if the message contains a
      UMTS authentication challenge, the UE shall proceed as specified in item d; if the SQN is invalid, the UE shall
      follow the procedure specified in this subclause, item e, starting again from the beginning.

      The UE shall deem that the network has failed the authentication check and proceed as described in item f if any
      of the following occurs:

      -   the timer T3420 expires;

      -   the UE detects any combination of the authentication failures: EMM cause #20 "MAC failure", #21 "synch
          failure", or #26 "non-EPS authentication unacceptable", during three consecutive authentication challenges.
          The authentication challenges shall be considered as consecutive only if the authentication challenges
          causing the second and third authentication failure are received by the UE while the timer T3418 or T3420
          started after the previous authentication failure is running.

      When it has been deemed by the UE that the source of the authentication challenge is not genuine (i.e.
      authentication not accepted by the UE), the UE shall proceed as described in item f.




          Figure 5.4.2.7.2: Authentication failure procedure (EMM cause #21 "synch failure")

      Upon receipt of an AUTHENTICATION REJECT message, the UE shall perform the actions as specified in
      subclause 5.4.2.5.

   f) Network failing the authentication check:

      If the UE deems that the network has failed the authentication check, then it shall request RRC to locally release
      the RRC connection and treat the active cell as barred (see 3GPP TS 36.304 [21]). The UE shall start any
      retransmission timers (e.g. T3410, T3417, T3421 or T3430), if they were running and stopped when the UE
      received the first AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message containing an incorrect authentication challenge
      data causing the authentication failure.

   g) Transmission failure of AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message or AUTHENTICATION FAILURE
      message indication from lower layers (if the authentication procedure is triggered by a tracking area updating
      procedure)

      The UE shall stop any of the timers T3418 and T3420, if running, and re-initiate the tracking area updating
      procedure.

   h) Transmission failure of AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message or AUTHENTICATION FAILURE
      message indication with TAI change from lower layers (if the authentication procedure is triggered by a service
      request procedure)

      The UE shall stop any of the timers T3418 and T3420, if running.

      If the current TAI is not in the TAI list, the authentication procedure shall be aborted and a tracking area
      updating procedure shall be initiated.

      If the current TAI is still part of the TAI list, it is up to the UE implementation how to re-run the ongoing
      procedure that triggered the authentication procedure.

   i) Transmission failure of AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message or AUTHENTICATION FAILURE
      message indication without TAI change from lower layers (if the authentication procedure is triggered by a
      service request procedure)

       The UE shall stop any of the timers T3418 and T3420, if running. It is up to the UE implementation how to re-
       run the ongoing procedure that triggered the authentication procedure.

   j) Lower layers indication of non-delivered NAS PDU due to handover

       If the AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message could not be delivered due to an intra MME handover and the
       target TA is included in the TAI list, then upon successful completion of the intra MME handover the MME
       shall retransmit the AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message. If a failure of handover procedure is reported by
       the lower layer and the S1 signalling connection exists, the MME shall retransmit the AUTHENTICATION
       REQUEST message.

For items c, d, and e:

       Depending on local requirements or operator preference for emergency bearer services, if the UE has a PDN
       connection for emergency bearer services established or is establishing a PDN connection for emergency bearer
       services, the MME need not follow the procedures specified for the authentication failure specified in the present
       subclause. The MME may respond to the AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message by initiating the security
       mode control procedure selecting the "null integrity protection algorithm" EIA0, null ciphering algorithm or may
       abort the authentication procedure and continue using the current security context, if any. The MME shall
       deactivate all non-emergency EPS bearer contexts, if any, by initiating an EPS bearer context deactivation
       procedure. If there is an ongoing PDN connectivity procedure, the MME shall deactivate all non-emergency EPS
       bearer contexts upon completion of the PDN connectivity procedure. The network shall consider the UE to be
       attached for emergency bearer services only.

       If a UE has a PDN connection for emergency bearer services established or is establishing a PDN connection for
       emergency bearer services and sends an AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message to the MME with the EMM
       cause appropriate for these cases (#20, #21, or #26, respectively) and receives the SECURITY MODE
       COMMAND message before the timeout of timer T3418 or T3420, the UE shall deem that the network has
       passed the authentication check successfully, stop timer T3418 or T3420, respectively, and execute the security
       mode control procedure.

       If a UE has a PDN connection for emergency bearer services established or is establishing a PDN connection for
       emergency bearer services when timer T3418 or T3420 expires, the UE shall not deem that the network has
       failed the authentication check and not behave as described in item f. Instead the UE shall continue using the
       current security context, if any, deactivate all non-emergency EPS bearer contexts, if any, by initiating UE
       requested PDN disconnect procedure. If there is an ongoing PDN connectivity procedure, the UE shall deactivate
       all non-emergency EPS bearer contexts upon completion of the PDN connectivity procedure. The UE shall start
       any retransmission timers (e.g. T3410, T3417, T3421 or T3430) if:

       -   they were running and stopped when the UE received the AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message and
           detected an authentication failure;

       -   the procedures associated with these timers have not yet been completed.

   The UE shall consider itself to be attached for emergency bearer services only.


5.4.3         Security mode control procedure

5.4.3.1           General
The purpose of the NAS security mode control procedure is to take an EPS security context into use, and initialise and
start NAS signalling security between the UE and the MME with the corresponding EPS NAS keys and EPS security
algorithms.

Furthermore, the network may also initiate the security mode control procedure in the following cases:

   -   in order to change the NAS security algorithms for a current EPS security context already in use; and

   -   in order to change the value of uplink NAS COUNT used in the latest SECURITY MODE COMPLETE
       message as described in 3GPP TS 33.401 [19], subclause 7.2.9.2.

For restrictions concerning the concurrent running of a security mode control procedure with other security related
procedures in the AS or inside the core network see 3GPP TS 33.401 [19], subclause 7.2.10.

5.4.3.2          NAS security mode control initiation by the network
The MME initiates the NAS security mode control procedure by sending a SECURITY MODE COMMAND message
to the UE and starting timer T3460 (see example in figure 5.4.3.2.1).

The MME shall reset the downlink NAS COUNT counter and use it to integrity protect the initial SECURITY MODE
COMMAND message if the security mode control procedure is initiated:

   -   to take into use the EPS security context created after a successful execution of the EPS authentication
       procedure;

   -   upon receipt of TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message including a GPRS ciphering key sequence
       number IE, if the MME wishes to create a mapped EPS security context (i.e. the type of security context flag is
       set to "mapped security context" in the NAS key set identifier IE included in the SECURITY MODE
       COMMAND message).

The MME shall send the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message unciphered, but shall integrity protect the message
with the NAS integrity key based on KASME or mapped K'ASME indicated by the eKSI included in the message. The
MME shall set the security header type of the message to "integrity protected with new EPS security context".

The MME shall create a locally generated KASME and send the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message including a
KSI value in the NAS key set identifier IE set to "000" and EIA0 and EEA0 as the selected NAS security algorithms
only when the security mode control procedure is initiated:

   -   during an attach procedure for emergency bearer services if no shared EPS security context is available;

   -   during a tracking area updating procedure for a UE that has a PDN connection for emergency bearer services if
       no shared EPS security context is available;

   -   during a service request procedure for a UE that has a PDN connection for emergency bearer services if no
       shared EPS security context is available; or

   -   after a failed authentication procedure for a UE that has a PDN connection for emergency bearer services or that
       is establishing a PDN connection for emergency bearer services, if continued usage of a shared security context
       is not possible.

The UE shall process a SECURITY MODE COMMAND message including a KSI value in the NAS key set identifier
IE set to "000" and EIA0 and EEA0 as the selected NAS security algorithms and, if accepted, create a locally generated
KASME when the security mode control procedure is initiated:

   -   during an attach procedure for emergency bearer services;

   -   during a tracking area updating procedure when the UE has a PDN connection for emergency bearer services;

   -   during a service request procedure when the UE has a PDN connection for emergency bearer services; or

   -   after an authentication procedure when the UE has a PDN connection for emergency bearer services or is
       establishing a PDN connection for emergency bearer services.

   NOTE 1: The process for creation of the locally generated KASME by the MME and the UE is implementation
           dependent.

Upon receipt of a TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message including a GPRS ciphering key sequence
number IE, if the MME does not have the valid current EPS security context indicated by the UE, the MME shall either:

   -   indicate the use of the new mapped EPS security context to the UE by setting the type of security context flag in
       the NAS key set identifier IE to "mapped security context" and the KSI value related to the security context of
       the source system; or

   -   set the KSI value "000" in the NAS key set identifier IE if the MME sets EIA0 and EEA0 as the selected NAS
       security algorithms for a UE that has a PDN connection for emergency bearer services.

While having a current mapped EPS security context with the UE, if the MME wants to take the native EPS security
context into use, the MME shall include the eKSI that indicates the native EPS security context in the SECURITY
MODE COMMAND message.

The MME shall include the replayed security capabilities of the UE (including the security capabilities with regard to
NAS, RRC and UP (user plane) ciphering as well as NAS and RRC integrity, and other possible target network security
capabilities, i.e. UTRAN/GERAN if the UE included them in the message to network), the replayed nonceUE when
creating a mapped EPS security context and if the UE included it in the message to the network, the selected NAS
ciphering and integrity algorithms and the Key Set Identifier (eKSI). If the MME supports handling of UE additional
security capabilities and the UE included a UE additional security capability IE in the message to the network, the
MME shall include the replayed additional security capabilities of the UE.

The MME shall include both the nonceMME and the nonceUE when creating a mapped EPS security context during inter-
system change from A/Gb mode to S1 mode or Iu mode to S1 mode in EMM-IDLE mode.

The MME may initiate a SECURITY MODE COMMAND in order to change the NAS security algorithms for a current
EPS security context already in use. The MME re-derives the NAS keys from KASME with the new NAS algorithm
identities as input and provides the new NAS algorithm identities within the SECURITY MODE COMMAND
message. The MME shall set the security header type of the message to "integrity protected with new EPS security
context".

If, during an ongoing attach or tracking area updating procedure, the MME is initiating a SECURITY MODE
COMMAND (i.e. after receiving the ATTACH REQUEST or TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, but
before sending a response to that message) and the ATTACH REQUEST or TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST
message is received without integrity protection or does not successfully pass the integrity check at the MME, the MME
shall calculate the HASHMME of the entire plain ATTACH REQUEST or TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST
message as described in 3GPP TS 33.401 [19] and shall include the HASHMME in the SECURITY MODE COMMAND
message.

Additionally, the MME may request the UE to include its IMEISV in the SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message.

   NOTE 2: The AS and NAS security capabilities will be the same, i.e. if the UE supports one algorithm for NAS, the
           same algorithm is also supported for AS.

5.4.3.3           NAS security mode command accepted by the UE
Upon receipt of the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message, the UE shall check whether the security mode
command can be accepted or not. This is done by performing the integrity check of the message and by checking that
the received replayed UE security capabilities, the received replayed UE additional security capabilities, if included in
the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message, and the received nonceUE have not been altered compared to the latest
values that the UE sent to the network. However, the UE is not required to perform the checking of the received

nonceUE if the UE does not want to re-generate the K'ASME (i.e. the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message is to
derive and take into use a mapped EPS security context and the eKSI matches the current EPS security context, if it is a
mapped EPS security context). When the UE has a PDN connection for emergency bearer services established or the
UE is establishing a PDN connection for emergency bearer services, the UE is not required to locally re-generate the
KASME (i.e. the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message is used to derive and take into use a native EPS security
context where the KSI value "000" is included in the NAS key set identifier IE and the EIA0 and EEA0 are included as
the selected NAS security algorithms).

The UE shall accept a SECURITY MODE COMMAND message indicating the "null integrity protection algorithm"
EIA0 as the selected NAS integrity algorithm only if the message is received for a UE that has a PDN connection for
emergency bearer services established or a UE that is establishing a PDN connection for emergency bearer services.

If the type of security context flag included in the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message is set to "native security
context" and if the KSI matches a valid non-current native EPS security context held in the UE while the UE has a
mapped EPS security context as the current EPS security context, the UE shall take the non-current native EPS security
context into use which then becomes the current native EPS security context and delete the mapped EPS security
context.

If the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message can be accepted, the UE shall take the EPS security context indicated
in the message into use. The UE shall in addition reset the uplink NAS COUNT counter if:

   -   the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message is received in order to take an EPS security context into use
       created after a successful execution of the EPS authentication procedure;

   -   the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message received includes the type of security context flag set to "mapped
       security context" in the NAS key set identifier IE the eKSI does not match the current EPS security context, if it
       is a mapped EPS security context.

If the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message can be accepted and a new EPS security context is taken into use and
SECURITY MODE COMMAND message does not indicate the "null integrity protection algorithm" EIA0 as the
selected NAS integrity algorithm, the UE shall:

   -   if the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message has been successfully integrity checked using an estimated
       downlink NAS COUNT equal 0, then the UE shall set the downlink NAS COUNT of this new EPS security
       context to 0;

   -   otherwise the UE shall set the downlink NAS COUNT of this new EPS security context to the downlink NAS
       COUNT that has been used for the successful integrity checking of the SECURITY MODE COMMAND
       message.

If the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message can be accepted, the UE shall send a SECURITY MODE
COMPLETE message integrity protected with the selected NAS integrity algorithm and the EPS NAS integrity key
based on the KASME or mapped K'ASME if the type of security context flag is set to "mapped security context" indicated
by the eKSI. When the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message includes the type of security context flag set to
"mapped security context" in the NAS key set identifier IE, the nonceMME and the nonceUE, then the UE shall either:

   -   generate K'ASME from both the nonceMME and the nonceUE as indicated in 3GPP TS 33.401 [19];or

   -   check whether the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message indicates the eKSI of the current EPS security
       context, if it is a mapped EPS security context, in order not to re-generate the K'ASME.

Furthermore, if the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message can be accepted, the UE shall cipher the SECURITY
MODE COMPLETE message with the selected NAS ciphering algorithm and the EPS NAS ciphering key based on the
KASME or mapped K'ASME indicated by the eKSI. The UE shall set the security header type of the message to "integrity
protected and ciphered with new EPS security context".

From this time onward the UE shall cipher and integrity protect all NAS signalling messages with the selected NAS
ciphering and NAS integrity algorithms.

If the MME indicated in the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message that the IMEISV is requested, the UE shall
include its IMEISV in the SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message.

If, during an ongoing attach or tracking area updating procedure, the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message
includes a HASHMME, the UE shall compare HASHMME with a hash value locally calculated as described in
3GPP TS 33.401 [19] from the entire plain ATTACH REQUEST or TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST

message that the UE had sent to initiate the procedure. If HASHMME and the locally calculated hash value are different,
the UE shall include the complete ATTACH REQUEST or TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message which
the UE had previously sent in the Replayed NAS message container IE of the SECURITY MODE COMPLETE
message.

5.4.3.4           NAS security mode control completion by the network
The MME shall, upon receipt of the SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message, stop timer T3460. From this time
onward the MME shall integrity protect and encipher all signalling messages with the selected NAS integrity and
ciphering algorithms.

If the SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message contains a Replayed NAS container message IE with an ATTACH
REQUEST or TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, the MME shall complete the ongoing attach or
tracking area updating procedure by considering the ATTACH REQUEST or TRACKING AREA UPDATE
REQUEST message contained in the Replayed NAS message container IE as the message that triggered the procedure.

5.4.3.5           NAS security mode command not accepted by the UE
If the security mode command cannot be accepted, the UE shall send a SECURITY MODE REJECT message. The
SECURITY MODE REJECT message contains an EMM cause that typically indicates one of the following cause
values:

   #23:   UE security capabilities mismatch;

   #24:   security mode rejected, unspecified.

Upon receipt of the SECURITY MODE REJECT message, the MME shall stop timer T3460. The MME shall also abort
the ongoing procedure that triggered the initiation of the NAS security mode control procedure.

Both the UE and the MME shall apply the EPS security context in use before the initiation of the security mode control
procedure, if any, to protect the SECURITY MODE REJECT message and any other subsequent messages according to
the rules in subclauses 4.4.4 and 4.4.5.

5.4.3.6           Abnormal cases in the UE
The following abnormal cases can be identified:

   a) Transmission failure of SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message or SECURITY MODE REJECT message
      indication from lower layers (if the security mode control procedure is triggered by a tracking area updating
      procedure)

       The UE shall abort the security mode control procedure and re-initiate the tracking area updating procedure.

   b) Transmission failure of SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message or SECURITY MODE REJECT message
      indication with TAI change from lower layers (if the security mode control procedure is triggered by a service
      request procedure)

       If the current TAI is not in the TAI list, the security mode control procedure shall be aborted and a tracking area
       updating procedure shall be initiated.

       If the current TAI is still part of the TAI list, the security mode control procedure shall be aborted and it is up to
       the UE implementation how to re-run the ongoing procedure that triggered the security mode control procedure.

   c) Transmission failure of SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message or SECURITY MODE REJECT message
      indication without TAI change from lower layers (if the security mode control procedure is triggered by a service
      request procedure)

       The security mode control procedure shall be aborted and it is up to the UE implementation how to re-run the
       ongoing procedure that triggered the security mode control procedure.

5.4.3.7           Abnormal cases on the network side
The following abnormal cases can be identified:

   a) Lower layer failure before the SECURITY MODE COMPLETE or SECURITY MODE REJECT message is
      received

       The network shall abort the security mode control procedure.

   b) Expiry of timer T3460

       The network shall, on the first expiry of the timer T3460, retransmit the SECURITY MODE COMMAND
       message and shall reset and start timer T3460. This retransmission is repeated four times, i.e. on the fifth expiry
       of timer T3460, the procedure shall be aborted.

   NOTE:      If the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message was sent to create a mapped EPS security context
              during inter-system change from A/Gb mode to S1 mode or Iu mode to S1 mode, then the network does
              not generate new values for the nonceMME and the nonceUE, but includes the same values in the
              SECURITY MODE COMMAND message (see the subclause 7.2.4.4 in 3GPP TS 33.401 [19]).

   c) Collision between security mode control procedure and attach, service request, tracking area updating procedure
      or detach procedure not indicating switch off

       The network shall abort the security mode control procedure and proceed with the UE initiated procedure.

   d) Collision between security mode control procedure and other EMM procedures than in item c

       The network shall progress both procedures.

   e) Lower layers indication of non-delivered NAS PDU due to handover

       If the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message could not be delivered due to an intra MME handover and the
       target TA is included in the TAI list, then upon successful completion of the intra MME handover the MME
       shall retransmit the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message. If a failure of the handover procedure is reported
       by the lower layer and the S1 signalling connection exists, the MME shall retransmit the SECURITY MODE
       COMMAND message.


5.4.4         Identification procedure

5.4.4.1          General
The identification procedure is used by the network to request a particular UE to provide specific identification
parameters, e.g. the International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) or the International Mobile Equipment Identity
(IMEI). IMEI and IMSI definition and structure are specified in 3GPP TS 23.003 [2].

For mobile device supporting both 3GPP access and cdma2000® access a single IMEI is used to identify the device as
specified in 3GPP TS 22.278 [1C].

5.4.4.2          Identification initiation by the network
The network initiates the identification procedure by sending an IDENTITY REQUEST message to the UE and starting
the timer T3470 (see example in figure 5.4.4.2.1). The IDENTITY REQUEST message specifies the requested
identification parameters in the Identity type information element.

5.4.4.3          Identification response by the UE
A UE shall be ready to respond to an IDENTITY REQUEST message at any time whilst in EMM-CONNECTED
mode.

Upon receipt of the IDENTITY REQUEST message the UE shall send an IDENTITY RESPONSE message to the
network. The IDENTITY RESPONSE message shall contain the identification parameters as requested by the network.

5.4.4.4          Identification completion by the network
Upon receipt of the IDENTITY RESPONSE the network shall stop the timer T3470.

5.4.4.5          Abnormal cases in the UE
The following abnormal cases can be identified:

   a) Requested identity is not available

      If the UE cannot encode the requested identity in the IDENTITY RESPONSE message, e.g. because no valid
      USIM is available, then it shall encode the identity type as "no identity".

   b) Transmission failure of IDENTITY RESPONSE message indication from lower layers (if the identification
      procedure is triggered by a tracking area updating procedure)

      The UE shall abort the identification procedure and re-initiate the tracking area updating procedure.

   c) Transmission failure of IDENTITY RESPONSE message indication with TAI change from lower layers (if the
      identification procedure is triggered by a service request procedure)

      If the current TAI is not in the TAI list, the identification procedure shall be aborted and a tracking area updating
      procedure shall be initiated.

      If the current TAI is still part of the TAI list, the identification procedure shall be aborted and it is up to the UE
      implementation how to re-run the ongoing procedure that triggered the identification procedure.

   d) Transmission failure of IDENTITY RESPONSE message indication without TAI change from lower layers (if
      the identification procedure is triggered by a service request procedure)

      The identification procedure shall be aborted and it is up to the UE implementation how to re-run the ongoing
      procedure that triggered the identification procedure.

5.4.4.6          Abnormal cases on the network side
The following abnormal cases can be identified:

   a) Lower layer failure

      Upon detection of a lower layer failure before the IDENTITY RESPONSE is received, the network shall abort
      any ongoing EMM procedure.

   b) Expiry of timer T3470

      The identification procedure is supervised by the network by the timer T3470. The network shall, on the first
      expiry of the timer T3470, retransmit the IDENTITY REQUEST message and reset and restart the timer T3470.
      This retransmission is repeated four times, i.e. on the fifth expiry of timer T3470, the network shall abort the
      identification procedure and any ongoing EMM procedure.

   c) Collision of an identification procedure with an attach procedure

      If the network receives an ATTACH REQUEST message before the ongoing identification procedure has been
      completed and no attach procedure is pending on the network (i.e. no ATTACH ACCEPT/REJECT message has
      still to be sent as an answer to an ATTACH REQUEST message), the network shall proceed with the attach
      procedure.

   d) Collision of an identification procedure with an attach procedure when the identification procedure has been
      caused by an attach procedure

      If the network receives an ATTACH REQUEST message before the ongoing identification procedure has been
      completed and an attach procedure is pending (i.e. an ATTACH ACCEPT/REJECT message has to be sent as an
      answer to an earlier ATTACH REQUEST message), then:

      -   If one or more of the information elements in the ATTACH REQUEST message differ from the ones
          received within the previous ATTACH REQUEST message, the network shall proceed with the new attach
          procedure; or

      -   If the information elements do not differ, then the network shall not treat any further this new ATTACH
          REQUEST.

   e) Collision of an identification procedure with a UE initiated detach procedure

      Detach containing cause "switch off" within the Detach type IE:

          If the network receives a DETACH REQUEST message before the ongoing identification procedure has been
          completed, the network shall abort the identification procedure and shall progress the detach procedure.

      Detach containing other causes than "switch off" within the Detach type IE:

          If the network receives a DETACH REQUEST message before the ongoing identification procedure has been
          completed, the network shall complete the identification procedure and shall respond to the detach procedure
          as described in subclause 5.5.2.

   f) Collision of an identification procedure with a tracking area updating procedure

      If the network receives a TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message before the ongoing identification
      procedure has been completed, the network shall progress both procedures.

   g) Collision of an identification procedure with a service request procedure

      If the network receives an EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST message for CS fallback or 1xCS fallback before
      the ongoing identification procedure has been completed, the network shall progress both procedures.

   h) Lower layers indication of non-delivered NAS PDU due to handover

      If the IDENTITY REQUEST message could not be delivered due to an intra MME handover and the target TA
      is included in the TAI list, then upon successful completion of the intra MME handover the MME shall
      retransmit the IDENTITY REQUEST message. If a failure of the handover procedure is reported by the lower
      layer and the S1 signalling connection exists, the MME shall retransmit the IDENTITY REQUEST message.


5.4.5        EMM information procedure

5.4.5.1          General
The purpose of sending the EMM INFORMATION message is to allow the network to provide information to the UE.
The message implementation is optional in the network. The UE may use the received information if the UE supports
implementing this message.

The EMM information procedure may be invoked by the network at any time during an established EMM context.

5.4.5.2          EMM information procedure initiation by the network
The EMM information procedure consists only of the EMM INFORMATION message sent from the network to the UE
(see example in figure 5.4.5.2.1). During an established EMM context, the network may send none, one, or more EMM
INFORMATION messages to the UE. If more than one EMM INFORMATION message is sent, the messages need not
have the same content.

5.4.5.3          EMM information procedure in the UE
When the UE (supporting the EMM information message) receives an EMM INFORMATION message, it shall accept
the message and optionally use the contents to update appropriate information stored within the UE.

If the UE does not support the EMM information message the UE shall ignore the contents of the message and return an
EMM STATUS message with EMM cause #97 "message type non-existent or not implemented".

5.4.5.4          Abnormal cases on the network side
The following abnormal case can be identified:

   a) Lower layers indication of non-delivered NAS PDU due to handover

       If the EMM INFORMATION message could not be delivered due to an intra MME handover and the target TA
       is included in the TAI list, then upon successful completion of the intra MME handover the MME shall
       retransmit the EMM INFORMATION message. If a failure of the handover procedure is reported by the lower
       layer and the S1 signalling connection exists, the MME shall retransmit the EMM INFORMATION message.


5.5           EMM specific procedures
5.5.1         Attach procedure

5.5.1.1          General
The attach procedure is used to attach to an EPC for packet services in EPS.

The attach procedure is used for three purposes:

   -   by a UE in PS mode of operation to attach for EPS services only;

   -   by a UE in CS/PS mode 1 or CS/PS mode 2 of operation to attach for both EPS and non-EPS services;

   -   by a UE supporting NB-S1 mode only in PS mode of operation to attach for EPS services and "SMS only"; or

   -   to attach for emergency bearer services.

The lower layers indicate to NAS that the network does not support emergency bearer services for the UE in limited
service state (3GPP TS 36.331 [22]). This information is taken into account when deciding whether to initiate attach for
emergency bearer services in WB-S1 mode.

If the MME does not support an attach for emergency bearer services, the MME shall reject any request to attach with
an attach type set to "EPS emergency attach".

With a successful attach procedure, a context is established for the UE in the MME. Furthermore, if the UE requested
PDN connectivity, a default bearer is established between the UE and the PDN GW, thus enabling always-on IP
connectivity to the UE. In WB-S1 mode, the network may also initiate the activation of dedicated bearers as part of the
attach procedure. In NB-S1 mode the network shall not initiate the activation of dedicated bearers.

With a successful attach procedure in NB-S1 mode, a context is established for the UE in the MME. If the attach
request included information to request PDN connectivity, a default bearer is also established between the UE and the
PDN.




                                                         ETSI
3GPP TS 24.301 version 15.8.0 Release 15                   106                        ETSI TS 124 301 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


If EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is supported by the UE and the MME, a default bearer need not be
requested by the UE during the attach procedure. If EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is not supported by
the UE or the MME, then the UE shall request establishment of a default bearer.

During the attach procedure with default bearer establishment, the UE may also obtain the home agent IPv4 or IPv6
address or both.

In a shared network, the UE shall choose one of the PLMN identities as specified in 3GPP TS 23.122 [6]. The UE shall
construct the TAI of the cell from this chosen PLMN identity and the TAC received for this PLMN identity as part of
the broadcast system information. The chosen PLMN identity shall be indicated to the E-UTRAN (see
3GPP TS 36.331 [22]). Whenever an ATTACH REJECT message with the EMM cause #11 "PLMN not allowed" is
received by the UE, the chosen PLMN identity shall be stored in the "forbidden PLMN list" and if the UE is configured
to use timer T3245 (see 3GPP TS 24.368 [15A] or 3GPP TS 31.102 [17]) then the UE shall start timer T3245 and
proceed as described in subclause 5.3.7a. Whenever an ATTACH REJECT message with the EMM cause #14 "EPS
services not allowed in this PLMN" is received by the UE, the chosen PLMN identity shall be stored in the "forbidden
PLMNs for GPRS service" and if the UE is configured to use timer T3245 (see 3GPP TS 24.368 [15A] or
3GPP TS 31.102 [17]) then the UE shall start timer T3245 and proceed as described in subclause 5.3.7a. Whenever an
ATTACH REJECT message is received by the UE with the EMM cause #12 "tracking area not allowed", #13 "roaming
not allowed in this tracking area", or #15 "no suitable cells in tracking area", the constructed TAI shall be stored in the
suitable list.

An attach attempt counter is used to limit the number of subsequently rejected attach attempts. The attach attempt
counter shall be incremented as specified in subclause 5.5.1.2.6. Depending on the value of the attach attempt counter,
specific actions shall be performed. The attach attempt counter shall be reset when:

   -   the UE is powered on;

   -   a USIM is inserted;

   -   an attach or combined attach procedure is successfully completed;

   NOTE:      The attach procedure can be initiated in S1 or S101 mode as described in subclause 5.5.1.

   -   a GPRS attach or combined GPRS attach procedure is successfully completed in A/Gb or Iu mode;

   -   a registration procedure for initial registration is successfully completed in N1 mode and the UE is operating in
       single-registration mode;

   -   a combined attach procedure is completed for EPS services only with cause #2, #16, #17, #18 or #22;

   -   an attach or combined attach procedure is rejected with cause #11, #12, #13, #14, #15, #25 or #35:

   -   a network initiated detach procedure is completed with cause #11, #12, #13, #14, #15 or #25; or

   -   a new PLMN is selected.

Additionally the attach attempt counter shall be reset when the UE is in substate EMM-
DEREGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-ATTACH and:

   -   a new tracking area is entered;

   -   timer T3402 expires; or

   -   timer T3346 is started.

5.5.1.2           Attach procedure for EPS services

5.5.1.2.1            General
This procedure can be used by a UE to attach for:

   -   EPS services only; or

   -   EPS services and "SMS only" if the UE supports NB-S1 mode only.

When the UE initiates the attach procedure for normal service, the UE shall indicate "EPS attach" in the EPS attach type
IE.

When the UE initiates the attach procedure for emergency bearer services, the UE shall indicate "EPS emergency
attach" in the EPS attach type IE. The attach procedure for emergency bearer services is not applicable for NB-S1 mode
(see 3GPP TS 23.401 [10]).

5.5.1.2.2             Attach procedure initiation
In state EMM-DEREGISTERED, the UE initiates the attach procedure by sending an ATTACH REQUEST message to
the MME, starting timer T3410 and entering state EMM-REGISTERED-INITIATED (see example in
figure 5.5.1.2.2.1). If timer T3402 is currently running, the UE shall stop timer T3402. If timer T3411 is currently
running, the UE shall stop timer T3411.

The UE shall include the IMSI in the EPS mobile identity IE in the ATTACH REQUEST message if the selected
PLMN is neither the registered PLMN nor in the list of equivalent PLMNs and:

   a) the UE is configured for "AttachWithIMSI" as specified in 3GPP TS 24.368 [15A] or 3GPP TS 31.102 [17]; or

   b) the UE is in NB-S1 mode.

For all other cases, the UE shall handle the EPS mobile identity IE in the ATTACH REQUEST message as follows:

   a) if the UE operating in the single-registration mode is performing an inter-system change from N1 mode to S1
      mode or the UE was previously registered in N1 mode before entering state 5GMM-DEREGISTERED and:

       1) the UE has received the interworking without N26 interface indicator set to "interworking without N26
          interface supported" from the network and:

          i) if the UE holds a valid GUTI, the UE shall include the valid GUTI into the EPS mobile identity IE,
             include Old GUTI type IE with GUTI type set to "native GUTI" and include the UE status IE with a
             5GMM registration status set to:

              -    "UE is in 5GMM-REGISTERED state" if the UE is in 5GMM-REGISTERED state; or

              -    "UE is in 5GMM-DEREGISTERED state" if the UE is in 5GMM-DEREGISTERED state; or

          ii) if the UE does not hold a valid GUTI, the UE shall include the IMSI in the EPS mobile identity IE; or

       2) the UE has received the interworking without N26 interface indicator set to "interworking without N26
          interface not supported" from the network and:

          i) if the UE holds a valid 5G-GUTI, the UE shall include a GUTI, mapped from 5G-GUTI into the EPS
             mobile identity IE, include Old GUTI type IE with GUTI type set to "native GUTI" and include the UE
             status IE with a 5GMM registration status set to "UE is in 5GMM-DEREGISTERED state";

          ii) if the UE holds a valid GUTI and does not hold a valid 5G-GUTI, the UE shall indicate the GUTI in the
              EPS mobile identity IE and include Old GUTI type IE with GUTI type set to "native GUTI"; or

          iii) if the UE holds neither a valid GUTI nor a vaild 5G-GUTI, the UE shall include the IMSI in the EPS
               mobile identity IE; or

   b) otherwise:

       1) if the UE supports neither A/Gb mode nor Iu mode, the UE shall include in the ATTACH REQUEST
          message a valid GUTI together with the last visited registered TAI, if available. In addition, the UE shall
          include Old GUTI type IE with GUTI type set to "native GUTI". If there is no valid GUTI available, the UE
          shall include the IMSI in the ATTACH REQUEST message; or

       2) If the UE supports A/Gb mode or Iu mode or both and:

          i) if the TIN indicates "P-TMSI" and the UE holds a valid P-TMSI and RAI, the UE shall map the P-TMSI
             and RAI into the EPS mobile identity IE, and include Old GUTI type IE with GUTI type set to "mapped
             GUTI". If a P-TMSI signature is associated with the P-TMSI, the UE shall include it in the Old P-TMSI
             signature IE. Additionally, if the UE holds a valid GUTI, the UE shall indicate the GUTI in the

                  identity IE; or

          iv) otherwise the UE shall include the IMSI in the EPS mobile identity IE.

If the UE is operating in the dual-registration mode and it is in 5GMM state 5GMM-REGISTERED, the UE shall
include the UE status IE with the 5GMM registration status set to "UE is in 5GMM-REGISTERED state".

If the UE is attaching for emergency bearer services and does not hold a valid GUTI, P-TMSI or IMSI as described
above, the IMEI shall be included in the EPS mobile identity IE.

If the UE supports A/Gb mode or Iu mode or if the UE needs to indicate its UE specific DRX parameter to the network,

5.5.1.2.3            EMM common procedure initiation
The network may initiate EMM common procedures, e.g. the identification, authentication and security mode control
procedures during the attach procedure, depending on the information received in the ATTACH REQUEST message
(e.g. IMSI, GUTI and KSI).

If the network receives an ATTACH REQUEST message containing the Old GUTI type IE and the EPS mobile identity
IE with type of identity indicating "GUTI", and the network does not follow the use of the most significant bit of the
<MME group id> as specified in 3GPP TS 23.003 [2], subclause 2.8.2.2.2, the network shall use the Old GUTI type IE
to determine whether the mobile identity included in the EPS mobile identity IE is a native GUTI or a mapped GUTI.

During an attach for emergency bearer services, the MME may choose to skip the authentication procedure even if no
EPS security context is available and proceed directly to the execution of the security mode control procedure as
specified in subclause 5.4.3.

5.5.1.2.4            Attach accepted by the network
During an attach for emergency bearer services, if not restricted by local regulations, the MME shall not check for
mobility and access restrictions, regional restrictions, subscription restrictions, or perform CSG access control when
processing the ATTACH REQUEST message. The network shall not apply subscribed APN based congestion control
during an attach procedure for emergency bearer services.

If the attach request is accepted by the network, the MME shall send an ATTACH ACCEPT message to the UE and
start timer T3450.

If the attach request included the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message in the ESM message container
information element to request PDN connectivity, the MME when accepting the attach request shall:

   -   send the ATTACH ACCEPT message together with an ESM DUMMY MESSAGE contained in the ESM
       message container information element and discard the ESM message container information element included in
       the attach request if:

       -   the UE indicated support of EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection in the UE network capability IE
           of the ATTACH REQUEST message;

       -   the MME supports EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection and PDN connection is restricted
           according to the user's subscription data;

       -   the attach type is not set to "EPS emergency attach"; and

       -   the request type of the UE requested PDN connection is not set to "emergency";

   -   otherwise, send the ATTACH ACCEPT message together with an ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER
       CONTEXT REQUEST message contained in the ESM message container information element to activate the
       default bearer (see subclause 6.4.1). In WB-S1 mode, the network may also initiate the activation of dedicated
       bearers towards the UE by invoking the dedicated EPS bearer context activation procedure (see subclause 6.4.2).
       In NB-S1 mode the network shall not initiate the activation of dedicated bearers.

If EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is supported by the UE and the MME, and the UE included an ESM
DUMMY MESSAGE in the ESM message container information element of the ATTACH REQUEST message, the
MME shall send the ATTACH ACCEPT message together with an ESM DUMMY MESSAGE contained in the ESM
message container information element.

If the attach request is accepted by the network, the MME shall delete the stored UE radio capability information, if
any.

In NB-S1 mode, if the attach request is accepted by the network, the MME shall set the EMC BS bit to zero in the EPS
network feature support IE included in the ATTACH ACCEPT message to indicate that support of emergency bearer
services in NB-S1 mode is not available.

If the UE has included the UE network capability IE or the MS network capability IE or both in the ATTACH
REQUEST message, the MME shall store all octets received from the UE, up to the maximum length defined for the
respective information element.

   NOTE 1: This information is forwarded to the new MME during inter-MME handover or to the new SGSN during
           inter-system handover to A/Gb mode or Iu mode.

   NOTE 2: For further details concerning the handling of the MS network capability and UE network capability in
           the MME see also 3GPP TS 23.401 [10].

If the UE specific DRX parameter was included in the DRX Parameter IE in the ATTACH REQUEST message, the
MME shall replace any stored UE specific DRX parameter with the received parameter and use it for the downlink
transfer of signalling and user data.

In NB-S1 mode, if the UE requested "SMS only" in the Additional update type IE, supports NB-S1 mode only and the
MME decides to accept the attach request for EPS services and "SMS only", the MME shall indicate "SMS only" in the
Additional update result IE and shall set the EPS attach result IE to "EPS only" in the ATTACH ACCEPT message.

The MME shall include the extended DRX parameters IE in the ATTACH ACCEPT message only if the extended DRX
parameters IE was included in the ATTACH REQUEST message, and the MME supports and accepts the use of eDRX.

The MME shall assign and include the TAI list the UE is registered to in the ATTACH ACCEPT message. The MME
shall not assign a TAI list containing both tracking areas in NB-S1 mode and tracking areas in WB-S1 mode. The UE,
upon receiving an ATTACH ACCEPT message, shall delete its old TAI list and store the received TAI list.

   NOTE 3: When assigning the TAI list, the MME can take into account the eNodeB's capability of support of CIoT
           EPS optimization.

The MME may include T3412 extended value IE in the ATTACH ACCEPT message only if the UE indicates support
of the extended periodic timer T3412 in the MS network feature support IE in the ATTACH REQUEST message.

The MME shall include the T3324 value IE in the ATTACH ACCEPT message only if the T3324 value IE was
included in the ATTACH REQUEST message, and the MME supports and accepts the use of PSM.

If the MME supports and accepts the use of PSM, and the UE included the T3412 extended value IE in the ATTACH
REQUEST message, then the MME shall take into account the T3412 value requested when providing the T3412 value
IE and the T3412 extended value IE in the ATTACH ACCEPT message.

   NOTE 4: Besides the value requested by the UE, the MME can take local configuration or subscription data
           provided by the HSS into account when selecting a value for T3412 (3GPP TS 23.401 [10]
           subclause 4.3.17.3).

If the UE indicates support for EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection in the ATTACH REQUEST message
and the MME supports EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection, the MME shall indicate support for EMM-
REGISTERED without PDN connection in the EPS network feature support IE of the ATTACH ACCEPT message.
The UE and the MME shall use the information whether the peer entity supports EMM-REGISTERED without PDN
connection as specified in the present clause 5 and in clause 6.

If the UE requests "control plane CIoT EPS optimization" in the Additional update type IE, indicates support of control
plane CIoT EPS optimization in the UE network capability IE and the MME decides to accept the requested CIoT EPS
optimization and the attach request, the MME shall indicate "control plane CIoT EPS optimization supported" in the
EPS network feature support IE.

If the MME supports NB-S1 mode, Non-IP PDN type, or inter-system change with 5GS, then the MME shall support
the extended protocol configuration options IE.

If the MME supports the extended protocol configuration options IE and the UE indicated support of the extended
protocol configuration options IE, then the MME shall set the ePCO bit to "extended protocol configuration options
supported" in the EPS network feature support IE of the ATTACH ACCEPT message.

If the UE indicates support for restriction on use of enhanced coverage in the ATTACH REQUEST message, and the
network decides to restrict the use of enhanced coverage for the UE, then the MME shall set the RestrictEC bit to "Use
of enhanced coverage is restricted" in the EPS network feature support IE of the ATTACH ACCEPT message.

If the UE has indicated support for the control plane data back-off timer, and the MME decides to activate the
congestion control for transport of user data via the control plane, then the MME shall include the T3448 value IE in the
ATTACH ACCEPT message.

If the UE indicates support for dual connectivity with NR in the ATTACH REQUEST message, and the MME decides
to restrict the use of dual connectivity with NR for the UE, then the MME shall set the RestrictDCNR bit to "Use of
dual connectivity with NR is restricted" in the EPS network feature support IE of the ATTACH ACCEPT message.

If the UE indicates support for N1 mode in the ATTACH REQUEST message and the MME supports inter-system
interworking with 5GS, the MME may set the IWK N26 bit to either:

   -   "interworking without N26 interface not supported" if the MME supports N26 interface; or

   -   "interworking without N26 interface supported" if the MME does not support N26 interface

in the EPS network feature support IE in the ATTACH ACCEPT message.

If the UE requests ciphering keys for ciphered broadcast assistance data in the ATTACH REQUEST message and the
MME has valid ciphering key data applicable to the UE's subscription, then the MME shall include the ciphering key
data in the Ciphering key data IE of the ATTACH ACCEPT message.

If due to operator policies unsecured redirection to a GERAN cell is not allowed in the current PLMN, the MME shall
set the redir-policy bit to "Unsecured redirection to GERAN not allowed" in the Network policy IE of the ATTACH
ACCEPT message.

The MME may include the T3447 value IE set to the service gap time value in the ATTACH ACCEPT message if:

   -   the UE has indicated support for service gap control; and

   -   a service gap time value is available in the EMM context.

If the network supports signalling for a maximum number of 15 EPS bearer contexts and the UE indicated support of
signalling for a maximum number of 15 EPS bearer contexts in the ATTACH REQUEST message, then the MME shall
set the 15 bearers bit to "Signalling for a maximum number of 15 EPS bearer contexts supported" in the EPS network
feature support IE of the ATTACH ACCEPT message.

Upon receiving the ATTACH ACCEPT message, the UE shall stop timer T3410.

The GUTI reallocation may be part of the attach procedure. When the ATTACH REQUEST message includes the IMSI
or IMEI, or the MME considers the GUTI provided by the UE is invalid, or the GUTI provided by the UE was assigned
by another MME, the MME shall allocate a new GUTI to the UE. The MME shall include in the ATTACH ACCEPT
message the new assigned GUTI together with the assigned TAI list. In this case the MME shall enter state EMM-
COMMON-PROCEDURE-INITIATED as described in subclause 5.4.1.

For a shared network, the TAIs included in the TAI list can contain different PLMN identities. The MME indicates the
selected core network operator PLMN identity to the UE in the GUTI (see 3GPP TS 23.251 [8B]).

If the ATTACH ACCEPT message contains a GUTI, the UE shall use this GUTI as the new temporary identity. The
UE shall delete its old GUTI and store the new assigned GUTI. If no GUTI has been included by the MME in the
ATTACH ACCEPT message, the old GUTI, if any available, shall be kept.

If A/Gb mode or Iu mode is supported in the UE, the UE shall set its TIN to "GUTI" when receiving the ATTACH
ACCEPT message.

If the ATTACH ACCEPT message contains the T3412 extended value IE, then the UE shall use the value in T3412
extended value IE as periodic tracking area update timer (T3412). If the ATTACH ACCEPT message does not contain
T3412 extended value IE, then the UE shall use the value in T3412 value IE as periodic tracking area update timer
(T3412).

If the ATTACH ACCEPT message contains the T3324 value IE, then the UE shall use the included timer value for
T3324 as specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 [13], subclause 4.7.2.8.

If the ATTACH ACCEPT message contains the DCN-ID IE, then the UE shall store the included DCN-ID value
together with the PLMN code of the registered PLMN in a DCN-ID list in a non-volatile memory in the ME as
specified in annex C.

The MME may also include a list of equivalent PLMNs in the ATTACH ACCEPT message. Each entry in the list
contains a PLMN code (MCC+MNC). The UE shall store the list as provided by the network, and if the attach
procedure is not for emergency bearer services, the UE shall remove from the list any PLMN code that is already in the
list of "forbidden PLMNs" or in the list of "forbidden PLMNs for GPRS service". In addition, the UE shall add to the
stored list the PLMN code of the registered PLMN that sent the list. The UE shall replace the stored list on each receipt
of the ATTACH ACCEPT message. If the ATTACH ACCEPT message does not contain a list, then the UE shall delete
the stored list.

If the attach procedure is not for emergency bearer services, and if the PLMN identity of the registered PLMN is a
member of the list of "forbidden PLMNs" or the list of "forbidden PLMNs for GPRS service", any such PLMN identity
shall be deleted from the corresponding list(s).

The network informs the UE about the support of specific features, such as IMS voice over PS session, location services
(EPC-LCS, CS-LCS), emergency bearer services, or CIoT EPS optimizations, in the EPS network feature support
information element. In a UE with IMS voice over PS capability, the IMS voice over PS session indicator and the
emergency bearer services indicator shall be provided to the upper layers. The upper layers take the IMS voice over PS
session indicator into account as specified in 3GPP TS 23.221 [8A], subclause 7.2a and subclause 7.2b, when selecting
the access domain for voice sessions or calls. When initiating an emergency call, the upper layers also take both the
IMS voice over PS session indicator and the emergency bearer services indicator into account for the access domain
selection. In a UE with LCS capability, location services indicators (EPC-LCS, CS-LCS) shall be provided to the upper
layers. When MO-LR procedure is triggered by the UE's application, those indicators are taken into account as specified
in 3GPP TS 24.171 [13C].

If the RestrictDCNR bit is set to "Use of dual connectivity with NR is restricted" in the EPS network feature support IE
of the ATTACH ACCEPT message, the UE shall provide the indication that dual connectivity with NR is restricted to
the upper layers.

The UE supporting N1 mode shall operate in the mode for inter-system interworking with 5GS as follows:

   -   if the IWK N26 bit in the EPS network feature support IE is set to "interworking without N26 interface not
       supported", the UE shall operate in single-registration mode;

   -   if the IWK N26 bit in the EPS network feature support IE is set to "interworking without N26 interface
       supported" and the UE supports dual-registration mode, the UE may operate in dual-registration mode; or

   NOTE:      The registration mode used by the UE is implementation dependent.

   -   if the IWK N26 bit in the EPS network feature support IE is set to "interworking without N26 interface
       supported" and the UE only supports single-registration mode, the UE shall operate in single-registration mode.

The UE shall treat the interworking without N26 interface indicator as valid in the entire PLMN and equivalent PLMNs.
The interworking procedures required for coordination between 5GMM and EMM without N26 interface are specified
in 3GPP TS 24.501 [54].

If the redir-policy bit is set to "Unsecured redirection to GERAN not allowed" in the Network policy IE of the
ATTACH ACCEPT message, the UE shall set the network policy on unsecured redirection to GERAN for the current
PLMN to "Unsecured redirection to GERAN not allowed" and indicate to the lower layers that unsecured redirection to
a GERAN cell is not allowed. If the redir-policy bit is set to "Unsecured redirection to GERAN allowed" or if the
Network policy IE is not included in the ATTACH ACCEPT message, the UE shall set the network policy for the
current PLMN to "Unsecured redirection to GERAN allowed" and indicate to the lower layers that unsecured
redirection to a GERAN cell is allowed. The UE shall set the network policy on unsecured redirection to GERAN to
"Unsecured redirection to GERAN not allowed" and indicate this to the lower layers when any of the following events
occurs:

   -   the UE initiates an EPS attach or tracking area updating procedure in a PLMN different from the PLMN where
       the UE performed the last successful EPS attach or tracking area updating procedure;

   -   the UE is switched on; or

   -   the UICC containing the USIM is removed.

If the UE has initiated the attach procedure due to manual CSG selection and receives an ATTACH ACCEPT message;
and the UE sent the ATTACH REQUEST message in a CSG cell, the UE shall check if the CSG ID and associated
PLMN identity of the cell are contained in the Allowed CSG list. If not, the UE shall add that CSG ID and associated
PLMN identity to the Allowed CSG list and the UE may add the HNB Name (if provided by lower layers) to the
Allowed CSG list if the HNB Name is present in neither the Operator CSG list nor the Allowed CSG list.

When the UE receives the ATTACH ACCEPT message combined with the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER
CONTEXT REQUEST message, and if the UE has requested PDN connectivity the UE shall forward the ACTIVATE
DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message to the ESM sublayer. Upon receipt of an indication from
the ESM sublayer that the default EPS bearer context has been activated, the UE shall send an ATTACH COMPLETE
message together with an ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT ACCEPT message contained in the ESM
message container information element to the network.

Additionally, the UE shall reset the attach attempt counter, enter state EMM-REGISTERED, and set the EPS update
status to EU1 UPDATED.

If EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is supported by the UE and the MME, and the UE receives the
ATTACH ACCEPT message combined with an ESM DUMMY MESSAGE, the UE shall send an ATTACH
COMPLETE message together with an ESM DUMMY MESSAGE contained in the ESM message container
information element to the network.

If the UE receives the ATTACH ACCEPT message from a PLMN for which a PLMN-specific attempt counter or
PLMN-specific PS-attempt counter is maintained (see subclause 5.3.7b), then the UE shall reset these counters. If the
UE maintains a counter for "SIM/USIM considered invalid for GPRS services", then the UE shall reset this counter.

When the UE receives any ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST messages during the
attach procedure, and if the UE has requested PDN connectivity the UE shall forward the ACTIVATE DEDICATED
EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message(s) to the ESM sublayer. The UE shall send a response to the
ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message(s) after successful completion of the attach
procedure.

If the attach procedure was initiated in S101 mode, the lower layers are informed about the successful completion of the
procedure.

Upon receiving an ATTACH COMPLETE message, the MME shall stop timer T3450, enter state EMM-REGISTERED
and consider the GUTI sent in the ATTACH ACCEPT message as valid.

If the T3448 value IE is present in the received ATTACH ACCEPT message, the UE shall:

   -   stop timer T3448 if it is running; and

   -   start timer T3448 with the value provided in the T3448 value IE.

If the UE is using EPS services with control plane CIoT EPS optimization, the T3448 value IE is present in the
ATTACH ACCEPT message and the value indicates that this timer is either zero or deactivated, the UE shall consider
this case as an abnormal case and proceed as if the T3448 value IE is not present.

5.5.1.2.4A           Attach successful for EPS services and not accepted for SMS services
Apart from the actions on the tracking area updating attempt counter, the description for attach for EPS services as
specified in subclause 5.5.1.2.4 shall be followed. In addition, the following description for attach for SMS services
applies.

In NB-S1 mode, if the UE requested "SMS only" in the Additional update type IE and supports NB-S1 mode only, the
MME decides to accept the attach request for EPS services only and:

   -   the location update for non-EPS services is not accepted by the VLR as specified in 3GPP TS 29.118 [16A]; or

   -   the MME decides to not accept the attach request for "SMS only",

the MME shall set the EPS attach result IE to "EPS only", shall not indicate "SMS only" in the Additional update result
IE in the ATTACH ACCEPT message and shall include an appropriate SMS services status value.

The UE receiving the ATTACH ACCEPT message takes one of the following actions depending on the value included
in the SMS services status IE:

   "SMS services not available"

          The UE shall stop timer T3410 if still running, shall reset the tracking area updating attempt counter, shall set
          the EPS update status to EU1 UPDATED and shall enter state EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE.
          The USIM shall be considered as invalid for SMS services until switching off or the UICC containing the
          USIM is removed or the timer T3245 expires as described in subclause 5.3.7a.

   "SMS services not available in this PLMN"

          The UE shall stop timer T3410 if still running, shall reset the tracking area updating attempt counter, shall set
          the EPS update status to EU1 UPDATED and shall enter state EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE.

          The UE may provide a notification to the user or the upper layers that the SMS services are not available.

          The UE shall not attempt normal attach or tracking area update procedure indicating "SMS only" with current
          PLMN until switching off the UE or the UICC containing the USIM is removed. Additionally, the UE may
          perform a PLMN selection according to 3GPP TS 23.122 [6].

   "Network failure"

          The UE shall stop timer T3410 if still running. The tracking area updating attempt counter shall be
          incremented, unless it was already set to 5.

          If the tracking area updating attempt counter is less than 5:

          -   the UE shall start timer T3411, shall set the EPS update status to EU1 UPDATED and shall enter state
              EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE. When timer T3411 expires the normal tracking area
              updating procedure for EPS services and "SMS only" or the combined tracking area updating procedure
              for EPS services and "SMS only" is triggered.

          If the tracking area updating attempt counter is equal to 5:

          -   the UE shall start timer T3402, shall set the EPS update status to EU1 UPDATED and shall enter state
              EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE. When timer T3402 expires the normal tracking area
              updating procedure for EPS services and "SMS only" or the combined tracking area updating procedure
              for EPS services and "SMS only" is triggered.

   "Congestion"

          The UE shall stop the timer T3410 if still running. The tracking area updating attempt counter shall be set
          to 5. The UE shall start the timer T3402, shall set the EPS update status to EU1 UPDATED, and shall enter
          state EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE. When timer T3402 expires the normal tracking area
          updating procedure for EPS services and "SMS only" or the combined tracking area updating procedure for
          EPS services and "SMS only" is triggered.

Other values and the case that no SMS services status IE was received are considered as abnormal cases. The attach
procedure shall be considered as failed for SMS services. The behaviour of the UE in those cases is specified in
subclause 5.5.1.2.6A.

5.5.1.2.5             Attach not accepted by the network
If the attach request cannot be accepted by the network, the MME shall send an ATTACH REJECT message to the UE
including an appropriate EMM cause value.

If EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is not supported by the UE or the MME, the attach request included a
PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message, the attach procedure fails due to:

   -   a default EPS bearer setup failure;

   -   an ESM procedure failure; or

   -   operator determined barring is applied on default EPS bearer context activation during attach procedure,

the MME shall:

   -   combine the ATTACH REJECT message with a PDN CONNECTIVITY REJECT message contained in the
       ESM message container information element. In this case the EMM cause value in the ATTACH REJECT
       message shall be set to #19 "ESM failure"; or

   -   send the ATTACH REJECT message with the EMM cause set to #15 "No suitable cells in tracking area", if the
       PDN connectivity reject is due to ESM cause #29 subject to operator policies (see 3GPP TS 29.274 [16D] for
       further details). In this case, the network may additionally include the Extended EMM cause IE with value "E-
       UTRAN not allowed".

If the attach request is rejected due to NAS level mobility management congestion control, the network shall set the
EMM cause value to #22 "congestion" and assign a back-off timer T3346.

If the attach request is rejected due to service gap control as specified in subclause 5.3.17 i.e. the T3447 timer is
running, the network shall set the EMM cause value to #22 "congestion" and may assign a back-off timer T3346 with
the remaining time of the running T3447 timer.

If the attach request is rejected due to incompatibility between the CIoT EPS optimizations supported by the UE and
what the network supports and the network sets the EMM cause value to #15 "no suitable cells in tracking area", the
network may additionally include the Extended EMM cause IE with value "requested EPS optimization not supported".

   NOTE 1: How the UE uses the Extended EMM cause IE with value "requested EPS optimization not supported" is
           implementation specific. The UE still behaves according to the EMM cause value #15.

Upon receiving the ATTACH REJECT message, if the message is integrity protected or contains a reject cause other
than EMM cause value #25, the UE shall stop timer T3410.

If the ATTACH REJECT message with EMM cause #25 was received without integrity protection, then the UE shall
discard the message.

The UE shall take the following actions depending on the EMM cause value received in the ATTACH REJECT
message.

   #3 (Illegal UE);

   #6 (Illegal ME); or

   #8 (EPS services and non-EPS services not allowed);

       The UE shall set the EPS update status to EU3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED (and shall store it according to
       subclause 5.1.3.3) and shall delete any GUTI, last visited registered TAI, TAI list and eKSI. The UE shall

      consider the USIM as invalid for EPS services and non-EPS services until switching off or the UICC containing
      the USIM is removed or the timer T3245 expires as described in subclause 5.3.7a. Additionally, the UE shall
      delete the list of equivalent PLMNs and enter state EMM-DEREGISTERED. If the message has been
      successfully integrity checked by the NAS and the UE maintains a counter for "SIM/USIM considered invalid
      for GPRS services", then the UE shall set this counter to UE implementation-specific maximum value. If the
      message has been successfully integrity checked by the NAS and the UE maintains a counter for "SIM/USIM
      considered invalid for non-GPRS services", then the UE shall set this counter to UE implementation-specific
      maximum value.

      If A/Gb mode or Iu mode is supported by the UE, the UE shall in addition handle the MM parameters update
      status, TMSI, LAI and ciphering key sequence number, and the GMM parameters GMM state, GPRS update
      status, P-TMSI, P-TMSI signature, RAI and GPRS ciphering key sequence number as specified in
      3GPP TS 24.008 [13] for the case when the normal attach procedure is rejected with the GMM cause with the
      same value.

      If the UE is operating in single-registration mode, the UE shall in addition handle the 5GMM parameters as
      specified in 3GPP TS 24.501 [54] for the case when the initial registration procedure is rejected with the 5GMM
      cause with the same value.

   NOTE 2: The possibility to configure a UE so that the radio transceiver for a specific RAT is not active, although it
           is implemented in the UE, is out of scope of the present specification.

   #7 (EPS services not allowed);

      The UE shall set the EPS update status to EU3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED (and shall store it according to
      subclause 5.1.3.3) and shall delete any GUTI, last visited registered TAI, TAI list and eKSI. The UE shall
      consider the USIM as invalid for EPS services until switching off or the UICC containing the USIM is removed
      or the timer T3245 expires as described in subclause 5.3.7a. Additionally, the UE shall delete the list of

      checked by the NAS and the UE maintains a counter for "SIM/USIM considered invalid for GPRS services",
      then the UE shall set this counter to UE implementation-specific maximum value.

      If A/Gb mode or Iu mode is supported by the UE, the UE shall in addition handle the GMM parameters GMM

       associated PLMN identity from the Allowed CSG list.

       If the CSG ID and associated PLMN identity of the cell where the UE has sent the ATTACH REQUEST
       message are contained in the Operator CSG list, the UE shall apply the procedures defined in
       3GPP TS 23.122 [6] subclause 3.1A.

       The UE shall search for a suitable cell according to 3GPP TS 36.304 [21].

       If A/Gb mode or Iu mode is supported by the UE, the UE shall in addition handle the GMM parameters GMM
       state, GPRS update status and GPRS attach attempt counter as specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 [13] for the case
       when the normal attach procedure is rejected with the GMM cause with the same value.

   #42    (Severe network failure);

       The UE shall set the EPS update status to EU2 NOT UPDATED, and shall delete any GUTI, last visited
       registered TAI, TAI list, eKSI, and list of equivalent PLMNs, and set the attach attempt counter to 5. The UE
       shall start an implementation specific timer setting its value to 2 times the value of T as defined in
       3GPP TS 23.122 [6]. While this timer is running, the UE shall not consider the PLMN + RAT combination that
       provided this reject cause a candidate for PLMN selection. The UE then enters state EMM-
       DEREGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH in order to perform a PLMN selection according to 3GPP TS 23.122 [6].

       If A/Gb mode or Iu mode is supported by the UE, the UE shall in addition set the GMM state to GMM-
       DEREGISTERED, GPRS update status to GU2 NOT UPDATED, and shall delete the P-TMSI, P-TMSI
       signature, RAI and GPRS ciphering key sequence number.

Other values are considered as abnormal cases. The behaviour of the UE in those cases is specified in
subclause 5.5.1.2.6.

5.5.1.2.5A           Attach for emergency bearer services not accepted by the network
If the attach request for emergency bearer services cannot be accepted by the network, the MME shall send an
ATTACH REJECT message to the UE including EMM cause #5 "IMEI not accepted" or one of the EMM cause values
as described in subclause 5.5.1.2.5.

   b) attempt EPS attach for emergency bearer services.

5.5.1.2.6            Abnormal cases in the UE
The following abnormal cases can be identified:

   a) Access barred because of access class barring, EAB, ACDC or NAS signalling connection establishment
      rejected by the network without "Extended wait time" received from lower layers

       In WB-S1 mode, if access is barred for "originating signalling" (see 3GPP TS 36.331 [22]), the attach procedure
       shall not be started. The UE stays in the current serving cell and applies the normal cell reselection process. The
       attach procedure is started as soon as possible, i.e. when access for "originating signalling" is granted on the
       current cell or when the UE moves to a cell where access for "originating signalling" is granted.

       In NB-S1 mode, if access is barred for "originating signalling" (see 3GPP TS 36.331 [22]), the attach procedure
       shall not be started. The UE stays in the current serving cell and applies the normal cell reselection process.
       Further UE behaviour is implementation specific, e.g. the attach procedure is started again after an
       implementation dependent time.

       In NB-S1 mode, if access is barred for "originating signalling" (see 3GPP TS 36.331 [22]), a request for an
       exceptional event is received from the upper layers, then the attach procedure shall be started.

   NOTE 1: In NB-S1 mode, the EMM layer cannot receive the access barring alleviation indication from the lower
           layers (see 3GPP TS 36.331 [22]).

       If access is barred because of access class barring for "originating signalling" (see 3GPP TS 36.331 [22]), ACDC
       is applicable to the request from the upper layers and the UE supports ACDC, then the attach procedure shall be
       started.

       If access is barred for a certain ACDC category (see 3GPP TS 36.331 [22]), a request with a higher ACDC
       category is received from the upper layers and the UE supports ACDC, then the attach procedure shall be started.



                                                          ETSI
3GPP TS 24.301 version 15.8.0 Release 15                    123                        ETSI TS 124 301 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


      If an access request for an uncategorized application is barred due to ACDC (see 3GPP TS 36.331 [22]), a
      request with a certain ACDC category is received from the upper layers and the UE supports ACDC, then the
      attach procedure shall be started.

   b) Lower layer failure or release of the NAS signalling connection without "Extended wait time" and without
      "Extended wait time CP data" received from lower layers before the ATTACH ACCEPT or ATTACH REJECT
      message is received

      The attach procedure shall be aborted, and the UE shall proceed as described below.

   c) T3410 timeout

      The UE shall abort the attach procedure and proceed as described below. The NAS signalling connection, if any,
      shall be released locally.

   NOTE 2: The NAS signalling connection can also be released if the UE deems that the network has failed the
           authentication check as specified in subclause 5.4.2.7.

   d) ATTACH REJECT, other EMM cause values than those treated in subclause 5.5.1.2.5, and cases of EMM cause
      values #22 and #25, if considered as abnormal cases according to subclause 5.5.1.2.5

      Upon reception of the EMM cause #19 "ESM failure", if the UE is not configured for NAS signalling low
      priority and the ESM cause value received in the PDN CONNECTIVITY REJECT message is not #54 "PDN
      connection does not exist", the UE may set the attach attempt counter to 5. Subsequently, if the UE needs to
      retransmit the ATTACH REQUEST message to request PDN connectivity towards a different APN, the UE may
      stop T3411 or T3402, if running, and send the ATTACH REQUEST message.

   NOTE 3: When receiving EMM cause #19 "ESM failure", coordination is required between the EMM and ESM
           sublayers in the UE to determine whether to set the attach attempt counter to 5.

      If the attach request is neither for emergency bearer services nor for initiating a PDN connection for emergency
      bearer services with attach type not set to "EPS emergency attach", upon reception of the EMM causes #95, #96,
      #97, #99 and #111 the UE should set the attach attempt counter to 5.

      The UE shall proceed as described below.

   e) Change of cell into a new tracking area

      If a cell change into a new tracking area occurs before the attach procedure is completed, the attach procedure
      shall be aborted and re-initiated immediately. If a tracking area border is crossed when the ATTACH ACCEPT
      message has been received but before an ATTACH COMPLETE message is sent, the attach procedure shall be
      re-initiated. If a GUTI was allocated during the attach procedure, this GUTI shall be used in the attach
      procedure.

   f) Mobile originated detach required

      The attach procedure shall be aborted, and the UE initiated detach procedure shall be performed.

   g) Detach procedure collision

      If the UE receives a DETACH REQUEST message from the network in state EMM-REGISTERED-INITIATED
      and the detach type indicates "re-attach not required" and no EMM cause IE, or "re-attach not required" and the
      EMM cause value is not #2 "IMSI unknown in HSS", the detach procedure shall be progressed and the attach
      procedure shall be aborted. If the UE receives a DETACH REQUEST message from the network in state EMM-
      REGISTERED-INITIATED and the detach type indicates "re-attach required", the detach procedure shall be
      progressed and the UE shall locally release the NAS signalling connection, before re-initiating the attach
      procedure. Otherwise the attach procedure shall be progressed and the DETACH REQUEST message shall be
      ignored.

   h) Transmission failure of ATTACH REQUEST message indication from lower layers

      The UE shall restart the attach procedure immediately.

   i) Transmission failure of ATTACH COMPLETE message indication from lower layers

      If the current TAI is not in the TAI list, the UE shall restart the attach procedure.

      If the current TAI is still in the TAI list, it is up to the UE implementation how to re-run the ongoing procedure.
      The EMM sublayer notifies the ESM sublayer that the ESM message in the ESM message container IE of the
      ATTACH COMPLETE has failed to be transmitted.

   j) If EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is not supported by the UE or the MME, and the ACTIVATE
      DEFAULT BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message combined with the ATTACH ACCEPT is not accepted
      by the UE due to failure in the UE ESM sublayer, then the UE shall initiate the detach procedure by sending a
      DETACH REQUEST message to the network. Further UE behaviour is implementation specific.

      If EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is supported by the UE and the MME, and the ACTIVATE
      DEFAULT BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message combined with the ATTACH ACCEPT is not accepted
      by the UE due to failure in the UE ESM sublayer, then the UE shall either send an ATTACH COMPLETE
      message together with an ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REJECT contained in the ESM
      message container information element to the network or initiate the detach procedure by sending a DETACH
      REQUEST message. Further UE behaviour is implementation specific.

   k) Indication from the lower layers that an S101 mode to S1 mode handover has been cancelled (S101 mode only)

      The UE shall abort the attach procedure and enter state EMM-DEREGISTERED.NO-CELL-AVAILABLE.

   l) "Extended wait time" from the lower layers

      If the ATTACH REQUEST message contained the low priority indicator set to "MS is configured for NAS
      signalling low priority", the UE shall start timer T3346 with the "Extended wait time" value and reset the attach
      attempt counter.

      If the ATTACH REQUEST message did not contain the low priority indicator set to "MS is configured for NAS
      signalling low priority", the UE is operating in NB-S1 mode and the UE is not a UE configured to use AC11 –
      15 in selected PLMN, then the UE shall start timer T3346 with the "Extended wait time" value and reset the
      attach attempt counter.

      In other cases the UE shall ignore the "Extended wait time".

      The UE shall abort the attach procedure, stay in the current serving cell, change the state to EMM-
      DEREGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-ATTACH and apply the normal cell reselection process.

      The UE shall proceed as described below.

   la) "Extended wait time CP data" from the lower layers

      If the UE is operating in NB-S1 mode, the UE shall start the timer T3346 with the "Extended wait time CP data"
      value and reset the attach attempt counter.

      In other cases the UE shall ignore the "Extended wait time CP data".

      The UE shall abort the attach procedure, stay in the current serving cell, change the state to EMM-
      DEREGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-ATTACH and apply the normal cell reselection process.

      The UE shall proceed as described below.

   m) Timer T3346 is running

      The UE shall not start the attach procedure unless:

      -   the UE is a UE configured to use AC11 – 15 in selected PLMN;

      -   the UE needs to attach for emergency bearer services;

      -   the UE in NB-S1 mode is requested by the upper layer to transmit user data related to an exceptional event
          and

          i) the UE is allowed to use exception data reporting (see the ExceptionDataReportingAllowed leaf of the
             NAS configuration MO in 3GPP TS 24.368 [15A] or the USIM file EFNASCONFIG in
             3GPP TS 31.102 [17]); and

           ii) timer T3346 was not started when NAS signaling connection was established with RRC establishment
               cause set to "MO exception data"; or

       -   the UE needs to attach without the NAS signalling low priority indication and if the timer T3346 was started
           due to rejection of a NAS request message (e.g. ATTACH REQUEST, TRACKING AREA UPDATE
           REQUEST or EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST) which contained the low priority indicator set to "MS is
           configured for NAS signalling low priority".

       The UE stays in the current serving cell and applies the normal cell reselection process.

   NOTE 4: It is considered an abnormal case if the UE needs to initiate an attach procedure while timer T3346 is
           running independent on whether timer T3346 was started due to an abnormal case or a non successful
           case.

       The UE shall proceed as described below.

   n) If EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is supported by the UE and the MME, an ESM DUMMY
      MESSAGE is included in the ESM message container information element of the ATTACH REQUEST message
      and the UE receives the ATTACH ACCEPT message combined with a PDN CONNECTIVITY REJECT
      message, the UE shall send an ATTACH COMPLETE message together with an ESM DUMMY MESSAGE
      contained in the ESM message container information element to the network. Further UE behaviour is
      implementation specific.

   o) Timer T3447 is running

       The UE shall not start the attach procedure unless:

       -   the UE is a UE configured to use AC11 – 15 in selected PLMN;

       -   the UE attempts to attach for emergency bearer services; or

       -   the UE attempts to attach without PDN connection request.

       The UE stays in the current serving cell and applies the normal cell reselection process. The attach request
       procedure is started, if still necessary, when timer T3447 expires.

For the cases b, c, d, l, la and m:

   -   Timer T3410 shall be stopped if still running.

   -   For the cases b, c, d, l when the "Extended wait time" is ignored, and la when the "Extended wait time CP data"
       is ignore, if the attach request is neither for emergency bearer services nor for initiating a PDN connection for
       emergency bearer services with attach type not set to "EPS emergency attach", the attach attempt counter shall
       be incremented, unless it was already set to 5.

   -   If the attach attempt counter is less than 5:

       -   for the cases l, la and m, the attach procedure is started, if still necessary, when timer T3346 expires or is
           stopped;

       -   for the cases b, c, d, l when the "Extended wait time" is ignored, and la when the "Extended wait time CP
           data" is ignore, if the attach request is neither for emergency bearer services nor for initiating a PDN
           connection for emergency bearer services with attach type not set to "EPS emergency attach", timer T3411 is
           started and the state is changed to EMM-DEREGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-ATTACH. When timer
           T3411 expires the attach procedure shall be restarted, if still required by ESM sublayer.

   -   If the attach attempt counter is equal to 5:

       -   the UE shall delete any GUTI, TAI list, last visited registered TAI, list of equivalent PLMNs and KSI, shall
           set the update status to EU2 NOT UPDATED, and shall start timer T3402. The state is changed to EMM-
           DEREGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-ATTACH or optionally to EMM-DEREGISTERED.PLMN-
           SEARCH in order to perform a PLMN selection according to 3GPP TS 23.122 [6]; and

       -   if A/Gb mode, Iu mode or N1 mode is supported by the UE:

          -   if A/Gb mode or Iu mode is supported by the UE, the UE shall in addition handle the GMM parameters
              GMM state, GPRS update status, P-TMSI, P-TMSI signature, RAI and GPRS ciphering key sequence
              number as specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 [13] for the abnormal case when a normal attach procedure fails
              and the attach attempt counter is equal to 5;

          -   if the UE is operating in single-registration mode, the UE shall in addition handle the 5GMM parameters
              as specified in 3GPP TS 24.501 [54] for the abnormal case when an initial registration procedure fails and
              the registration attempt counter is equal to 5; and

          -   the UE shall attempt to select GERAN, UTRAN or NG-RAN radio access technology and proceed with
              appropriate GMM or 5GMM specific procedures. Additionally, the UE may disable the E-UTRA
              capability as specified in subclause 4.5.

      included in the SMS services status IE not treated in subclause 5.5.1.2.4A or the SMS services status IE is not
      included in the message, the UE shall proceed as follows:

      a) The UE shall stop timer T3410 if still running. The tracking area updating attempt counter shall be
         incremented, unless it was already set to 5;

      b) If the tracking area updating attempt counter is less than 5:

          -   the UE shall start timer T3411, shall set the EPS update status to EU1 UPDATED and shall enter state
              EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE. When timer T3411 expires the normal tracking area
              updating procedure for EPS services and "SMS only" or the combined tracking area updating procedure
              for EPS services and "SMS only" is triggered;

      c) If the tracking area updating attempt counter is equal to 5:

          -   the UE shall start timer T3402, shall set the EPS update status to EU1 UPDATED and shall enter state
              EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE. When timer T3402 expires the normal tracking area
              updating procedure for EPS services and "SMS only" or the combined tracking area updating procedure
              for EPS services and "SMS only" is triggered; and

   2) otherwise, the abnormal cases specified in subclause 5.5.1.2.6 apply.

5.5.1.2.7              Abnormal cases on the network side
The following abnormal cases can be identified:

   a) Lower layer failure

      If a lower layer failure occurs before the message ATTACH COMPLETE has been received from the UE, the
      network shall locally abort the attach procedure, enter state EMM-DEREGISTERED and shall not resend the
      message ATTACH ACCEPT. If a new GUTI was assigned to the UE in the attach procedure, the MME shall
      consider both the old and the new GUTI as valid until the old GUTI can be considered as invalid by the network
      or the EMM context which has been marked as detached in the network is released.

      If the old GUTI was allocated by an MME other than the current MME, the current MME does not need to retain
      the old GUTI. If the old GUTI is used by the UE in a subsequent attach message, the network may use the
      identification procedure to request the UE's IMSI.

   b) Protocol error

      If the ATTACH REQUEST message is received with a protocol error, the network shall return an ATTACH
      REJECT message with one of the following EMM cause values:

      #96:    invalid mandatory information;

      #99:    information element non-existent or not implemented;




                                                          ETSI
3GPP TS 24.301 version 15.8.0 Release 15                  127                       ETSI TS 124 301 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


      #100: conditional IE error; or

      #111: protocol error, unspecified.

   c) T3450 time-out

      On the first expiry of the timer, the network shall retransmit the ATTACH ACCEPT message and shall reset and
      restart timer T3450.

      This retransmission is repeated four times, i.e. on the fifth expiry of timer T3450, the attach procedure shall be
      aborted and the MME enters state EMM-DEREGISTERED. If a new GUTI was allocated in the ATTACH
      ACCEPT message, the network shall consider both the old and the new GUTI as valid until the old GUTI can be
      considered as invalid by the network or the EMM context which has been marked as detached in the network is
      released. If the old GUTI was allocated by an MME other than the current MME, the current MME does not
      need to retain the old GUTI.

      If the old GUTI is used by the UE in a subsequent attach message, the network acts as specified for case a above.

   d) ATTACH REQUEST received after the ATTACH ACCEPT message has been sent and before the ATTACH
      COMPLETE message is received

      -   If one or more of the information elements in the ATTACH REQUEST message differ from the ones
          received within the previous ATTACH REQUEST message, the previously initiated attach procedure shall
          be aborted if the ATTACH COMPLETE message has not been received and the new attach procedure shall
          be progressed; or

      -   if the information elements do not differ, then the ATTACH ACCEPT message shall be resent and the timer
          T3450 shall be restarted if an ATTACH COMPLETE message is expected. In that case, the retransmission
          counter related to T3450 is not incremented.

   e) More than one ATTACH REQUEST received and no ATTACH ACCEPT or ATTACH REJECT message has
      been sent

      -   If one or more of the information elements in the ATTACH REQUEST message differs from the ones
          received within the previous ATTACH REQUEST message, the previously initiated attach procedure shall
          be aborted and the new attach procedure shall be executed;

      -   if the information elements do not differ, then the network shall continue with the previous attach procedure
          and shall ignore the second ATTACH REQUEST message.

   f) ATTACH REQUEST received in state EMM-REGISTERED

      If an ATTACH REQUEST message is received in state EMM-REGISTERED the network may initiate the
      EMM common procedures; if it turned out that the ATTACH REQUEST message was sent by a UE that has
      already been attached, the EMM context, EPS bearer contexts, if any, are deleted and the new ATTACH
      REQUEST is progressed.

   g) TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message received before ATTACH COMPLETE message.

      Timer T3450 shall be stopped. The allocated GUTI in the attach procedure shall be considered as valid and the
      tracking area updating procedure shall be rejected with the EMM cause #10 "implicitly detached" as described in
      subclause 5.5.3.2.5.

   h) DETACH REQUEST message received before ATTACH COMPLETE message.

      The network shall abort the attach procedure and shall progress the detach procedure as described in
      subclause 5.5.2.2.

   i) If EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is supported by the UE and the MME, the MME receives an
      ATTACH REQUEST message with an ESM message included in the ESM message container information
      element, and the ESM sublayer in the MME detects a message error according to clause 7, the MME may decide
      to proceed with the attach procedure or to reject it. When sending the ATTACH ACCEPT or ATTACH REJECT
      message to the UE, the MME shall include the ESM message provide by the ESM layer in the ESM message
      container information element.

   j) UE security capabilities invalid or unacceptable



                                                         ETSI
3GPP TS 24.301 version 15.8.0 Release 15                    128                       ETSI TS 124 301 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


       If the ATTACH REQUEST message is received with invalid or unacceptable UE security capabilities (e.g. no
       EPS encryption algorithms (all bits zero), no EPS integrity algorithms (all bits zero), mandatory EPS encryption
       algorithms not supported or mandatory EPS integrity algorithms not supported, etc.), the MME shall return an
       ATTACH REJECT message.

   NOTE:      EMM cause value to be used in ATTACH REJECT message is up to the network implementation.

5.5.1.3           Combined attach procedure for EPS services and non-EPS services
                  (S1 mode only)

5.5.1.3.1            General
The combined attach procedure is used by a UE in CS/PS mode 1 or CS/PS mode 2 of operation to attach for both EPS
and non-EPS services, or both EPS services and "SMS only".

The combined attach procedure is also used by a UE in CS/PS mode 1 or CS/PS mode 2 of operation to attach for EPS
services if it is already IMSI attached for non-EPS services.

When the UE initiates a combined attach procedure, the UE shall indicate "combined EPS/IMSI attach" in the EPS
attach type IE.

The combined attach procedure follows the attach procedure for EPS described in subclause 5.5.1.2 with exception of
subclause 5.5.1.2.4A and subclause 5.5.1.2.6A.

5.5.1.3.2            Combined attach procedure initiation
If the UE is in EMM state EMM-DEREGISTERED, the UE initiates the combined attach procedure by sending an
ATTACH REQUEST message to the network, starting timer T3410 and entering state EMM-REGISTERED-
INITIATED (see example in figure 5.5.1.2.2.1).

The UE shall include the TMSI status IE if no valid TMSI is available. Furthermore, if the UE has stored a valid
location area identification, the UE shall include it in the Old location area identification IE in the ATTACH REQUEST
message.

If the UE has stored a valid TMSI, the UE shall include the TMSI based NRI container IE in the ATTACH REQUEST
message.

If the UE initiates a combined attach procedure for EPS services and "SMS only", the UE shall indicate "SMS only" in
the Additional update type IE.

5.5.1.3.3            EMM common procedure initiation
The network may initiate EMM common procedures, e.g. the identification, authentication and security mode control
procedures, depending on the received information such as IMSI, GUTI and KSI.

5.5.1.3.4            Combined attach accepted by the network

5.5.1.3.4.1              General

Depending on the value of the EPS attach result IE received in the ATTACH ACCEPT message, the following different
cases can be distinguished:

   1) The EPS attach result IE value indicates "combined EPS/IMSI attach": attach for EPS and non-EPS services, or
      for EPS services and "SMS only" have been successful.

   2) The EPS attach result IE value indicates "EPS only": attach for EPS services has been successful but attach for
      non-EPS services or "SMS only" has failed.

5.5.1.3.4.2              Combined attach successful

The description for attach for EPS services as specified in subclause 5.5.1.2.4 shall be followed. In addition, the
following description for attach for non-EPS services or "SMS only" applies.



                                                           ETSI
3GPP TS 24.301 version 15.8.0 Release 15                    129                        ETSI TS 124 301 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


The TMSI reallocation may be part of the combined attach procedure. The TMSI allocated is then included in the
ATTACH ACCEPT message, together with the location area identification (LAI). In this case the MME shall start timer
T3450 as described in subclause 5.4.1.4, and enter state EMM-COMMON-PROCEDURE-INITIATED. If the MME
does not indicate "SMS only" in the ATTACH ACCEPT message, subject to operator policies the MME should allocate
a TAI list that does not span more than one location area.

For a shared network in CS domain, the MME indicates the selected PLMN for CS domain in the LAI to the UE as
specified in 3GPP TS 23.272 [9].

The UE, receiving an ATTACH ACCEPT message, stores the received location area identification, stops timer T3410,
resets the location update attempt counter and sets the update status to U1 UPDATED. If the message contains an IMSI,
the UE is not allocated any TMSI, and shall delete any TMSI accordingly. If the message contains a TMSI, the UE shall
use this TMSI as the new temporary identity. The UE shall delete its old TMSI and shall store the new TMSI. If neither
a TMSI nor an IMSI has been included by the network in the ATTACH ACCEPT message, the old TMSI, if any
available, shall be kept.

If the UE maintains a counter for "SIM/USIM considered invalid for non-GPRS services" events (see subclause 5.3.7b),
then the UE shall reset this counter.

If the UE requested "SMS only" in the Additional update type IE, or if the UE requested a combined attach for EPS and
non-EPS services, but the network decides to accept the attach request for EPS services and "SMS only", the network
shall indicate "SMS only" in the Additional update result IE. In addition, if the SMS services are provided via SMS in
MME, the network shall provide a non-broadcast LAI in the ATTACH ACCEPT message. If a TMSI has to be
allocated, then the network shall also provide a TMSI value which cannot cause any ambiguity with assigned TMSI
values.

If the ATTACH ACCEPT message includes the Additional update result IE with value "SMS only", a UE operating in
CS/PS mode 2 and a UE operating in CS/PS mode 1 with "IMS voice available" shall not attempt to use CS fallback for
mobile originating services.

As an implementation option, if the ATTACH ACCEPT message does not include the Additional update result IE with
value "SMS only" and the UE is not configured for NAS signaling low priority then the UE may stop timer T3246 if
running.

If the ATTACH ACCEPT message includes the Additional update result IE with value "CS Fallback not preferred", this
indicates to a UE operating in CS/PS mode 2 and a UE operating in CS/PS mode 1 with "IMS voice available" that it is
attached for EPS and non-EPS services and that it can use CS fallback.

If the LAI contained in the ATTACH ACCEPT message is a member of the list of "forbidden location areas for
regional provision of service" or the list of "forbidden location areas for roaming" then such entry shall be deleted.

If the PLMN identity for the CS domain which is provided as part of the LAI contained in the ATTACH ACCEPT
message differs from the PLMN identity provided as part of the GUTI, the MME shall include the PLMN identity for
the CS domain in the list of equivalent PLMNs in the ATTACH ACCEPT message.

The UE, when having requested PDN connectivity as contained in the ATTACH REQUEST and on receiving the
ATTACH ACCEPT message combined with the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST
message, shall send an ATTACH COMPLETE message combined with an ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER
CONTEXT ACCEPT message to the network.

Upon transmission of the ATTACH COMPLETE message the UE shall enter state EMM-REGISTERED and MM state
MM-IDLE and set the EPS update status to EU1 UPDATED.

If the ATTACH ACCEPT message includes the Additional update result IE with value "SMS only" or "CS Fallback not
preferred", a UE operating in CS/PS mode 1 with "IMS voice not available" shall attempt to select GERAN or UTRAN
radio access technology and disable the E-UTRA capability (see subclause 4.5).

Upon receiving an ATTACH COMPLETE message, the MME shall stop timer T3450, enter state EMM-
REGISTERED.

   NOTE:      Upon receiving an ATTACH COMPLETE message, the MME sends an SGsAP-TMSI-
              REALLOCATION-COMPLETE message as specified in 3GPP TS 29.118 [16A].

5.5.1.3.4.3              Combined attach successful for EPS services only

Apart from the actions on the tracking area updating attempt counter, the description for attach for EPS services as
specified in subclause 5.5.1.2.4 shall be followed. In addition, the following description for attach for non-EPS services
applies.

The UE receiving the ATTACH ACCEPT message takes one of the following actions depending on the EMM cause
value:

   #2 (IMSI unknown in HSS)

          The UE shall stop T3410 if still running and shall reset the tracking area updating attempt counter. The UE
          shall set the update status to U3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED and shall delete any TMSI, LAI and ciphering
          key sequence number. The UE shall enter state EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE. The new MM
          state is MM IDLE. The USIM shall be considered as invalid for non-EPS services until switching off or the
          UICC containing the USIM is removed.or the timer T3245 expires as described in subclause 5.3.7a. If the UE
          maintains a counter for "SIM/USIM considered invalid for non-GPRS services", then the UE shall set this
          counter to UE implementation-specific maximum value.

   #16    (MSC temporarily not reachable); or

   #17    (Network failure)

          The UE shall stop timer T3410 if still running, and shall enter state MM IDLE. The tracking area updating
          attempt counter shall be incremented, unless it was already set to 5.

          If the tracking area updating attempt counter is less than 5:

          -   the UE shall start timer T3411, shall set the EPS update status to EU1 UPDATED and shall enter state
              EMM-REGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-UPDATE-MM. When timer T3411 expires the combined
              tracking area updating procedure indicating "combined TA/LA updating with IMSI attach" is triggered.

          If the tracking area updating attempt counter is equal to 5:

          -   a UE operating in CS/PS mode 2 of operation and a UE operating in CS/PS mode 1 of operation with
              "IMS voice available" shall start timer T3402, shall set the EPS update status to EU1 UPDATED and
              shall enter state EMM-REGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-UPDATE-MM. When timer T3402 expires
              the combined tracking area updating procedure indicating "combined TA/LA updating with IMSI attach"
              is triggered;

          -   a UE operating in CS/PS mode 1 of operation with "IMS voice not available" shall attempt to select
              GERAN or UTRAN radio access technology and proceed with appropriate MM or GMM specific
              procedures and disable the E-UTRA capability (see subclause 4.5).

   #18    (CS domain not available)

          The UE shall stop timer T3410 if still running, shall reset the tracking area updating attempt counter, shall set
          the EPS update status to EU1 UPDATED and shall enter state EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE.

          The UE shall enter state MM IDLE and shall set the update status to U2 NOT UPDATED.

          A UE in CS/PS mode 1 of operation with "IMS voice not available" shall attempt to select GERAN or
          UTRAN radio access technology and disable the E-UTRA capability (see subclause 4.5).

          A UE in CS/PS mode 2 of operation and a UE operating in CS/PS mode 1 of operation with "IMS voice
          available" may provide a notification to the user or the upper layers that the CS domain is not available.

          The UE shall not attempt combined attach or combined tracking area update procedure with current PLMN
          until switching off the UE or the UICC containing the USIM is removed.

   #22    (Congestion)

          The UE shall stop the timer T3410 if still running. The tracking area updating attempt counter shall be set
          to 5. The UE shall start the timer T3402, shall set the EPS update status to EU1 UPDATED, shall enter state
          EMM-REGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-UPDATE-MM, and shall enter state MM IDLE.

Other EMM cause values and the case that no EMM cause IE was received are considered as abnormal cases. The
combined attach procedure shall be considered as failed for non-EPS services. The behaviour of the UE in those cases is
specified in subclause 5.5.1.3.6.

5.5.1.3.5             Combined attach not accepted by the network
If the attach request can neither be accepted by the network for EPS nor for non-EPS services, the MME shall send an
ATTACH REJECT message to the UE including an appropriate EMM cause value. If EMM-REGISTERED without
PDN connection is not supported by the UE or the MME, the attach request included a PDN CONNECTIVITY
REQUEST message, and the attach procedure fails due to a default EPS bearer setup failure, an ESM procedure failure
or operator determined barring, the MME shall:

   -   combine the ATTACH REJECT message with a PDN CONNECTIVITY REJECT message contained in the
       ESM message container information element. In this case the EMM cause value in the ATTACH REJECT
       message shall be set to #19, "ESM failure"; or

   -   send the ATTACH REJECT message with the EMM cause set to #15 "No suitable cells in tracking area" ,if the
       PDN connectivity reject is due to ESM cause #29 subject to operator policies (see 3GPP TS 29.274 [16D] for
       further details). In this case, the network may additionally include the Extended EMM cause IE with value "E-
       UTRAN not allowed".

If the attach request is rejected due to NAS level mobility management congestion control, the network shall set the
EMM cause value to #22 "congestion" and assign a back-off timer T3346.

If the attach request is rejected due to service gap control as specified in subclause 5.3.17 i.e. the T3447 timer is
running, the network shall set the EMM cause value to #22 "congestion" and may assign a back-off timer T3346 with
the remaining time of the running T3447 timer.

Upon receiving the ATTACH REJECT message, if the message is integrity protected or contains a reject cause other
than EMM cause value #25, the UE shall stop timer T3410 and enter MM state MM IDLE.

If the ATTACH REJECT message with EMM cause #25 was received without integrity protection, then the UE shall
discard the message.

The UE shall take the following actions depending on the EMM cause value received in the ATTACH REJECT
message.

   #3 (Illegal UE);

   #6 (Illegal ME); or

   #8 (EPS services and non-EPS services not allowed);

       The UE shall set the EPS update status to EU3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED (and shall store it according to
       subclause5.1.3.3) and shall delete any GUTI, last visited registered TAI, TAI list and eKSI.

       The UE shall consider the USIM as invalid for EPS and non-EPS services until switching off or the UICC
       containing the USIM is removed or the timer T3245 expires as described in subclause 5.3.7a. Additionally, the
       UE shall delete the list of equivalent PLMNs and shall enter the state EMM-DEREGISTERED. If the message
       has been successfully integrity checked by the NAS and the UE maintains a counter for "SIM/USIM considered
       invalid for GPRS services", then the UE shall set this counter to UE implementation-specific maximum value. If
       the message has been successfully integrity checked by the NAS and the UE maintains a counter for "SIM/USIM
       considered invalid for non-GPRS services", then the UE shall set this counter to UE implementation-specific
       maximum value.

       If A/Gb mode or Iu mode is supported by the UE, the UE shall in addition handle the MM parameters update
       status, TMSI, LAI and ciphering key sequence number, and the GMM parameters GMM state, GPRS update
       status, P-TMSI, P-TMSI signature, RAI and GPRS ciphering key sequence number as specified in
       3GPP TS 24.008 [13] for the case when the combined attach procedure is rejected with the GMM cause with the
       same value.

       If the UE is operating in single-registration mode, the UE shall in addition handle the 5GMM parameters as
       specified in 3GPP TS 24.501 [54] for the case when the initial registration procedure is rejected with the 5GMM
       cause with the same value.

   #7 (EPS services not allowed);

      The UE shall set the EPS update status to EU3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED (and shall store it according to
      subclause 5.1.3.3) and shall delete any GUTI, last visited registered TAI, TAI list and eKSI. The UE shall
      consider the USIM as invalid for EPS services until switching off or the UICC containing the USIM is removed
      or the timer T3245 expires as described in subclause 5.3.7a. Additionally, the UE shall delete the list of
      equivalent PLMNs and shall enter the state EMM-DEREGISTERED. If the message has been successfully
      integrity checked by the NAS and the UE maintains a counter for "SIM/USIM considered invalid for GPRS
      services", then the UE shall set this counter to UE implementation-specific maximum value.

      A UE which is already IMSI attached for non-EPS services is still IMSI attached for non-EPS services and shall
      set the update status to U2 NOT UPDATED.

      The UE shall attempt to select GERAN or UTRAN radio access technology and shall proceed with the
      appropriate MM specific procedure according to the MM service state. The UE shall not reselect E-UTRAN
      radio access technology until switching off or the UICC containing the USIM is removed.

      If A/Gb mode or Iu mode is supported by the UE, the UE shall in addition handle the GMM parameters GMM
      state, GPRS update status, P-TMSI, P-TMSI signature, RAI and GPRS ciphering key sequence number as
      specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 [13] for the case when the combined attach procedure is rejected with the GMM
      cause with the same value.

      If the UE is operating in single-registration mode, the UE shall in addition handle the 5GMM parameters as
      specified in 3GPP TS 24.501 [54] for the case when the initial registration procedure is rejected with the 5GMM
      cause with the same value.

   #11   (PLMN not allowed); or

   #35   (Requested service option not authorized in this PLMN);

      The UE shall set the EPS update status to EU3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED (and shall store it according to
      subclause 5.1.3.3) and shall delete any GUTI, last visited registered TAI, TAI list and eKSI, and reset the attach
      attempt counter. The UE shall delete the list of equivalent PLMNs and enter the state EMM-

   #22    (Congestion);

      If the T3346 value IE is present in the ATTACH REJECT message and the value indicates that this timer is
      neither zero nor deactivated, the UE shall proceed as described below; otherwise it shall be considered as an
      abnormal case and the behaviour of the UE for this case is specified in subclause 5.5.1.3.6.

      The UE shall abort the attach procedure, reset the attach attempt counter, set the EPS update status to EU2 NOT

      The UE shall stop timer T3346 if it is running.

      If the ATTACH REJECT message is integrity protected, the UE shall start timer T3346 with the value provided
      in the T3346 value IE.

      If the ATTACH REJECT message is not integrity protected, the UE shall start timer T3346 with a random value

   #42    (Severe network failure);

       The UE shall set the EPS update status to EU2 NOT UPDATED, and shall delete any GUTI, last visited
       registered TAI, TAI list, eKSI, and list of equivalent PLMNs, and set the attach attempt counter to 5. The UE
       shall start an implementation specific timer, setting its value to 2 times the value of T as defined in
       3GPP TS 23.122 [6]. While this timer is running, the UE shall not consider the PLMN + RAT combination that
       provided this reject cause as a candidate for PLMN selection. The UE then enters state EMM-
       DEREGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH in order to perform a PLMN selection according to 3GPP TS 23.122 [6].

       DEREGISTERED, GPRS update status to GU2 NOT UPDATED, and shall delete the P-TMSI, P-TMSI
       signature, RAI and GPRS ciphering key sequence number.

Other values are considered as abnormal cases. The behaviour of the UE in those cases is specified in
subclause 5.5.1.3.6.

5.5.1.3.6            Abnormal cases in the UE
The UE shall proceed as follows:

   1) if the UE requested the combined attach for EPS services and "SMS only" and the ATTACH ACCEPT message
      indicates a combined attach successful for EPS and non-EPS services, the UE shall behave as if the combined
      attach was successful for EPS services and "SMS only";

   NOTE:      In this case the UE can ignore the CS SERVICE NOTIFICATION message or the Paging with CN
              domain indicator set to "CS", as specified in subclause 5.6.2.3.2.

   2) if the combined attach was successful for EPS services only and the ATTACH ACCEPT message contained an
      EMM cause value not treated in subclause 5.5.1.3.4.3 or the EMM cause IE is not included in the message, the
      UE shall proceed as follows:

       a) The UE shall stop timer T3410 if still running, and shall enter state MM IDLE. The tracking area updating
          attempt counter shall be incremented, unless it was already set to 5;

       b) If the tracking area updating attempt counter is less than 5:

          -   the UE shall start timer T3411, shall set the EPS update status to EU1 UPDATED and shall enter state
              EMM-REGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-UPDATE-MM. When timer T3411 expires the combined
              tracking area updating procedure indicating "combined TA/LA updating with IMSI attach" is triggered;

       c) If the tracking area updating attempt counter is equal to 5:

          -   a UE operating in CS/PS mode 2 of operation and a UE operating in CS/PS mode 1 of operation with
              "IMS voice available" shall start timer T3402, shall set the EPS update status to EU1 UPDATED and
              shall enter state EMM-REGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-UPDATE-MM. When timer T3402 expires
              the combined tracking area updating procedure indicating "combined TA/LA updating with IMSI attach"
              is triggered; and

          -   a UE operating in CS/PS mode 1 of operation with "IMS voice not available" shall attempt to select
              GERAN or UTRAN radio access technology and proceed with appropriate MM or GMM specific
              procedures and disable the E-UTRA capability (see subclause 4.5); and

       d) If there is a CS fallback emergency call pending or CS fallback call pending, the UE shall attempt to select
          GERAN or UTRAN radio access technology. If the UE finds a suitable GERAN or UTRAN cell, it then

           proceeds with the appropriate MM and CC specific procedures; otherwise the EMM sublayer shall indicate
           the abort of the EMM procedure to the MM sublayer; and

   3) otherwise, the abnormal cases specified in subclause 5.5.1.2.6 apply with the following modification.

       If the attach attempt counter is incremented according to subclause 5.5.1.2.6 the next actions depend on the value
       of the attach attempt counter:

       -   if the attach attempt counter is less than 5, the UE shall set the update status to U2 NOT UPDATED but shall
           not delete any LAI, TMSI, ciphering key sequence number and list of equivalent PLMNs; or

       -   if the attach attempt counter is equal to 5, then the UE shall delete any LAI, TMSI, ciphering key sequence
           number and list of equivalent PLMNs and set the update status to U2 NOT UPDATED. The UE shall attempt
           to select GERAN, UTRAN or NG-RAN radio access technology and proceed with appropriate MM, GMM
           or 5GMM specific procedures. Additionally, the UE may disable the E-UTRA capability as specified in
           subclause 4.5.

       If there is a CS fallback emergency call pending or CS fallback call pending, the UE shall attempt to select
       GERAN or UTRAN radio access technology. If the UE finds a suitable GERAN or UTRAN cell, it then
       proceeds with the appropriate MM and CC specific procedures; otherwise the EMM sublayer shall indicate the
       abort of the EMM procedure to the MM sublayer.

5.5.1.3.7            Abnormal cases on the network side
The abnormal cases specified in subclause 5.5.1.2.7 apply.


5.5.2         Detach procedure

5.5.2.1          General
The detach procedure is used:

   -   by the UE to detach for EPS services only;

   -   by the UE to disconnect from the last remaining PDN it is connected to if EMM-REGISTERED without PDN
       connection is not supported by the UE or the MME;

   -   by the UE in CS/PS mode 1 or CS/PS mode 2 of operation to detach for both EPS services and non-EPS services
       or for non-EPS services only via a combined detach procedure;

   -   by the network to inform the UE that it is detached for EPS services or non-EPS services or both;

   -   by the network to disconnect the UE from the last remaining PDN to which it is connected if EMM-
       REGISTERED without PDN connection is not supported by the UE or the MME; and

   -   by the network to inform the UE to re-attach to the network and re-establish all PDN connections.

   NOTE 1: After a successful completion of an inter-system change of the UE from S1 mode to non-3GPP access, if
           the non-3GPP network provides PDN connectivity to the same EPC and EMM-REGISTERED without
           PDN connection is not supported by the UE or the MME, the MME performs a local detach of the UE.

   NOTE 2: If EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is supported by the UE and the MME, the detach
           procedure is not triggered when disconnecting the UE from the last remaining PDN to which it is
           connected.

The detach procedure also applies to the UE which is IMSI attached for "SMS only".

The detach procedure with appropriate detach type shall be invoked by the UE if the UE is switched off, the USIM card
is removed from the UE, the UE wishes to detach for EPS services, the UE wishes to detach for non-EPS services or as
part of the eCall inactivity procedure defined in subclause 5.5.4.

If the detach procedure is triggered due to USIM removal, the UE shall indicate "switch off" in the detach type IE.

When upper layers indicates that emergency bearer services are no longer required, the UE if still attached for
emergency bearer services, may perform a detach followed by a re-attach to regain normal services, if the UE is in or
moves to a suitable cell.

If a detach is requested by the HSS for a UE that has bearers for emergency services, the MME shall not send a
DETACH REQUEST message to the UE, and shall follow the procedures in subclause 6.4.4.1 for a UE that has bearers
for emergency services.

If the detach procedure for EPS services is performed, the EPS bearer context(s), if any, for this particular UE are
deactivated locally without peer-to-peer signalling between the UE and the MME.

If the UE supports A/Gb mode or Iu mode or both, the UE shall store the TIN in the non-volatile memory in the ME, as
described in annex C, for a subsequent attach procedure.

The UE is allowed to initiate the detach procedure even if the timer T3346 is running.

The network proceeds with the detach procedure even if NAS level mobility management congestion control is active.

5.5.2.2           UE initiated detach procedure

5.5.2.2.1            UE initiated detach procedure initiation
The detach procedure is initiated by the UE by sending a DETACH REQUEST message (see example in
figure 5.5.2.2.1.1). The Detach type IE included in the message indicates whether detach is due to a "switch off" or not.
The Detach type IE also indicates whether the detach is for EPS services only, for non-EPS services only, or for both. If
the UE has a mapped EPS security context as the current EPS security context, the UE shall set the type of security
context flag to "mapped security context". Otherwise, the UE shall set the type of security context flag to "native
security context".

If the UE has a valid GUTI, the UE shall populate the EPS mobile identity IE with the valid GUTI. If the UE does not
have a valid GUTI, the UE shall populate the EPS mobile identity IE with its IMSI.

If the UE does not have a valid GUTI and it does not have a valid IMSI, then the UE shall populate the EPS mobile
identity IE with its IMEI.

   NOTE:      During the attach for emergency service when the UE (with no USIM or invalid USIM) is in EMM-
              REGISTERED-INITIATED STATE, the UE has neither a valid GUTI nor a valid IMSI.

If the detach is not due to switch off and the UE is in the state EMM-REGISTERED or EMM-REGISTERED-
INITIATED, timer T3421 shall be started in the UE after the DETACH REQUEST message has been sent. If the detach
type indicates that the detach is for non-EPS services only the UE shall enter the state EMM-REGISTERED.IMSI-
DETACH-INITIATED, otherwise the UE shall enter the state EMM-DEREGISTERED-INITIATED. If the detach type
indicates that the detach is for non-EPS services or both EPS and non-EPS services, the UE shall enter the state MM
IMSI DETACH PENDING.

If the UE to be switched off is not operating in NB-S1 mode and not operating in WB-S1 mode in any enhanced
coverage CE mode, the UE shall try for a period of 5 seconds to send the DETACH REQUEST message. If the UE to
be switched off:-

   -   is operating in NB-S1 mode, then the UE should try for at least a period of 85 seconds to send the DETACH
       REQUEST; or

   -   is operating in WB-S1 mode in any enhanced coverage CE mode, then the UE should try for at least a period of
       14 seconds to send the DETACH REQUEST.

During this period, the UE may be switched off as soon as the DETACH REQUEST message has been sent.

After the last DETACH REQUEST message is sent, the UE shall proceed as follows:

   -   if the current EPS security context is a native EPS security context, then the UE shall store the current EPS
       security context as specified in annex C and mark it as valid;

   -   else if the current EPS security context is a mapped EPS security context and a non-current full native EPS
       security context exists, then the UE shall store the non-current EPS security context as specified in annex C and

5.5.2.2.2             UE initiated detach procedure completion for EPS services only
When the DETACH REQUEST message is received by the network, the network shall send a DETACH ACCEPT
message to the UE, if the Detach type IE does not indicate "switch off". Otherwise, the procedure is completed when
the network receives the DETACH REQUEST message.

The network and the UE shall deactivate the EPS bearer context(s), if any, for this UE locally without peer-to-peer
signalling between the UE and the MME.

The UE is marked as inactive in the network for EPS services. The network shall enter the state EMM-
DEREGISTERED.

The UE, when receiving the DETACH ACCEPT message, shall stop timer T3421. Furthermore, if the UE is operating
in PS mode of operation, or is operating in CS/PS mode of operation and supports S1 mode only then:

   -   If the detach procedure was performed due to disabling of EPS services, then the UE shall enter the EMM-
       NULL state.

   -   Otherwise, the UE shall enter the EMM-DEREGISTERED state.

The UE operating in CS/PS mode 1 or CS/PS mode 2 of operation, and supporting A/Gb mode or Iu mode, shall further
set the update status to U2 NOT UPDATED, disable the E-UTRA capability (see subclause 4.5) and attempt to select
GERAN or UTRAN access technology.

5.5.2.2.3             UE initiated combined detach procedure completion
When the DETACH REQUEST message is received by the network, a DETACH ACCEPT message shall be sent to the
UE, if the Detach type IE does not indicate "switch off". Otherwise, the procedure is completed when the network
receives the DETACH REQUEST message.

Depending on the value of the Detach type IE the following applies:

   -   combined EPS/IMSI detach:

       The network and the UE shall deactivate the EPS bearer context(s) for this UE locally without peer-to-peer
       signalling between the UE and the MME. The UE is marked as inactive in the network for EPS and for non-EPS
       services. The states EMM-DEREGISTERED and MM-NULL are entered in both the UE and the network.

   -   IMSI detach:

3GPP TS 24.301 version 15.8.0 Release 15                  139                        ETSI TS 124 301 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


      The UE is marked as inactive in the network for non-EPS services. The states MM-NULL and EMM-
      REGISTERED are entered in both the UE and the network.

The UE, when receiving the DETACH ACCEPT message, shall stop timer T3421.

5.5.2.2.4           Abnormal cases in the UE
The following abnormal cases can be identified:

   a) Access barred because of access class barring, EAB or NAS signalling connection establishment rejected by the
      network

      In WB-S1 mode, if access is barred for "originating signalling" (see 3GPP TS 36.331 [22]), the detach signalling
      procedure shall not be started. The UE stays in the current serving cell and applies the normal cell reselection
      process. The detach signalling procedure is started as soon as possible and if still necessary, i.e. when access for
      "originating signalling" is granted on the current cell or when the UE moves to a cell where access for
      "originating signalling" is granted. The UE may perform a local detach either immediately or after an
      implementation dependent time.

      In NB-S1 mode, if access is barred for "originating signalling" (see 3GPP TS 36.331 [22]), the detach signalling
      procedure shall not be started. The UE stays in the current serving cell and applies the normal cell reselection
      process. Further UE behaviour is implementation specific, e.g. the detach signalling procedure is started again
      after an implementation dependent time.

   NOTE 1: In NB-S1 mode, the EMM layer cannot receive the access barring alleviation indication from the lower
           layers (see 3GPP TS 36.331 [22]).

   b) Lower layer failure or release of the NAS signalling connection before reception of DETACH ACCEPT message

      The detach procedure shall be aborted and the UE proceeds as follows:

      -   if the detach procedure was performed due to disabling of EPS services, the UE shall enter the EMM-NULL
          state;

      -   if "EPS detach" was requested for reasons other than disabling of EPS services, the UE shall enter the EMM-
          DEREGISTERED state;

      -   if "IMSI detach" was requested, the UE shall enter the EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE state and
          the MM-NULL state; or

      -   if "combined EPS/IMSI detach" was requested, the UE shall enter the EMM-DEREGISTERED state and the
          MM-NULL state.

   c) T3421 timeout

      On the first four expiries of the timer, the UE shall retransmit the DETACH REQUEST message and shall reset
      and restart timer T3421. On the fifth expiry of timer T3421, the detach procedure shall be aborted and the UE
      proceeds as follows:

      -   if the detach procedure was performed due to disabling of EPS services, the UE shall enter the EMM-NULL
          state;

      -   if "EPS detach" was requested for reasons other than disabling of EPS services, the UE shall enter the EMM-
          DEREGISTERED state;

      -   if "IMSI detach" was requested, the UE shall enter the EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE state and
          the MM-NULL state; or

      -   if "combined EPS/IMSI detach" was requested, the UE shall enter the EMM-DEREGISTERED state and the
          MM-NULL state.

   d) Detach procedure collision

      Detach containing cause "switch off" within the Detach type IE:




                                                          ETSI
3GPP TS 24.301 version 15.8.0 Release 15                    140                         ETSI TS 124 301 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


      -   If the UE receives a DETACH REQUEST message before the UE initiated detach procedure has been
          completed, this message shall be ignored and the UE initiated detach procedure shall continue.

      Detach containing other causes than "switch off" within the Detach type IE:

      -   If the UE receives a DETACH REQUEST message before the UE initiated detach procedure has been
          completed, it shall treat the message as specified in subclause 5.5.2.3.2 with the following modifications:

          -   If the DETACH REQUEST message received by the UE contains detach type "re-attach required", and
              the UE initiated detach procedure is with detach type "EPS detach" or "combined EPS/IMSI detach", the
              UE need not initiate the attach or combined attach procedure.

          -   If the DETACH REQUEST message received by the UE contains detach type "IMSI detach", and the UE
              initiated detach procedure is with detach type "IMSI detach", the UE need not re-attach to non-EPS
              services.

          -   If the DETACH REQUEST message received by the UE contains detach type "IMSI detach", and the UE
              initiated detach procedure is with detach type "EPS detach" or "combined EPS/IMSI detach", the UE
              shall progress both procedures. The UE need not re-attach to non-EPS services.

   e) Detach and EMM common procedure collision

      Detach containing cause "switch off":

      -   If the UE receives a message used in an EMM common procedure before the detach procedure has been
          completed, this message shall be ignored and the detach procedure shall continue.

      Detach containing other causes than "switch off" and containing detach type "IMSI detach":

      -   If the UE receives a message used in an EMM common procedure before the detach procedure has been
          completed, both the EMM common procedure and the detach procedure shall continue.

      Detach containing other causes than "switch off" and containing other detach types than "IMSI detach":

      -   If the UE receives a GUTI REALLOCATION COMMAND, an EMM STATUS or an EMM
          INFORMATION message before the detach procedure is completed, this message shall be ignored and the
          detach procedure shall continue.

      -   If the UE receives an AUTHENTICATION REQUEST, SECURITY MODE COMMAND or IDENTITY
          REQUEST message before the detach procedure has been completed, the UE shall respond to it as described
          in subclause 5.4.2, 5.4.3 and 5.4.4 respectively and the detach procedure shall continue.

   f) Change of cell into a new tracking area

      If a cell change into a new tracking area that is not in the stored TAI list occurs before the UE initiated detach
      procedure is completed, the detach procedure shall be aborted and re-initiated after successfully performing a
      tracking area updating procedure. If the detach procedure was initiated due to removal of the USIM or the UE is
      to be switched off, the UE shall abort the detach procedure and enter the state EMM-DEREGISTERED.

   g) Transmission failure of DETACH REQUEST message indication with TAI change from lower layers

      If the current TAI is not in the TAI list, the detach procedure shall be aborted and re-initiated after successfully
      performing a tracking area updating procedure. If the detach procedure was initiated due to removal of the USIM
      or the UE is to be switched off, the UE shall abort the detach procedure and enter the state EMM-
      DEREGISTERED.

      If the current TAI is still part of the TAI list, the UE shall restart the detach procedure.

   h) Transmission failure of DETACH REQUEST message indication without TAI change from lower layers

      The UE shall restart the detach procedure.

   i) Detach and paging procedure collision




                                                           ETSI
3GPP TS 24.301 version 15.8.0 Release 15                    141                        ETSI TS 124 301 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


       If the UE receives a CS SERVICE NOTIFICATION message before the UE initiated combined detach
       procedure with detach type "IMSI detach" or "combined EPS/IMSI detach" has been completed, then this
       message shall be ignored and the UE initiated combined detach procedure shall continue.

5.5.2.2.5             Abnormal cases on the network side
The following abnormal cases can be identified:

   a) Detach request received in a CSG cell for which the UE has no valid CSG subscription

       If the UE initiates a detach procedure in a CSG cell the CSG ID of which is not valid for the UE, and the detach
       procedure is not due to "switch off", the network shall proceed as follows:

       -   if the detach type is "IMSI detach" and the UE has a PDN connection for emergency bearer services active,
           the MME shall send a DETACH ACCEPT message and deactivate all non-emergency EPS bearers, if any, by
           initiating an EPS bearer context deactivation procedure;

       -   otherwise, the network shall initiate the detach procedure. The MME shall send a DETACH REQUEST
           message including the EMM cause #25,"not authorized for this CSG".

   b) Lower layers indication of non-delivered NAS PDU due to handover

       If the DETACH ACCEPT message could not be delivered due to an intra MME handover and the target TA is
       included in the TAI list, then upon successful completion of the intra MME handover the MME shall retransmit
       the DETACH ACCEPT message. If a failure of the handover procedure is reported by the lower layer and the S1
       signalling connection exists, the MME shall retransmit the DETACH ACCEPT message.

5.5.2.3           Network initiated detach procedure

5.5.2.3.1             Network initiated detach procedure initiation
The network initiates the detach procedure by sending a DETACH REQUEST message to the UE (see example in
figure 5.5.2.3.1).

   NOTE:      If the MME performs a local detach, it will inform the UE with an EMM messages (e.g. SERVICE
              REJECT or TRACKING AREA UPDATE reject) with EMM cause #10 "implicitly detached" only when
              the UE initiates an EMM procedure.

The network may include an EMM cause IE to specify the reason for the detach request. The network shall start timer
T3422. If the Detach type IE indicates "re-attach required" or "re-attach not required" and the EMM cause value is not
#2 "IMSI unknown in HSS", or if the MME performs a local detach, the MME shall either store the current EPS
security context if it is a native EPS security context, or the MME shall delete the current EPS security context if it is a
mapped EPS security context. If the detach type IE indicates "re-attach required" or "re-attach not required" and the
EMM cause value is not #2 "IMSI unknown in HSS", the network shall deactivate the EPS bearer context(s), if any, for
the UE locally and enter state EMM-DEREGISTERED-INITIATED.

3GPP TS 24.301 version 15.8.0 Release 15                   142                       ETSI TS 124 301 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


5.5.2.3.2             Network initiated detach procedure completion by the UE
When receiving the DETACH REQUEST message and the detach type indicates "re-attach required", the UE shall
deactivate the EPS bearer context(s), if any, including the default EPS bearer context locally without peer-to-peer
signalling between the UE and the MME. The UE shall stop the timer T3346, if it is running. The UE shall also stop
timer(s) T3396, if it is running. The UE shall send a DETACH ACCEPT message to the network and enter the state
EMM-DEREGISTERED. Furthermore, the UE shall, after the completion of the detach procedure, and the release of
the existing NAS signalling connection, initiate an attach or combined attach procedure. The UE should also re-
establish any previously established PDN connection(s).

   NOTE 1: When the detach type indicates "re-attach required", user interaction is necessary in some cases when the
           UE cannot re-activate the EPS bearer(s), if any, automatically.

A UE which receives a DETACH REQUEST message with detach type indicating "re-attach required" or "re-attach not
required" and no EMM cause IE, is detached only for EPS services.

When receiving the DETACH REQUEST message and the detach type indicates "IMSI detach", the UE shall not
deactivate the EPS bearer context(s) including the default EPS bearer context. The UE shall set the MM update status to
U2 NOT UPDATED. A UE may send a DETACH ACCEPT message to the network, and shall re-attach to non-EPS
services by performing the combined tracking area updating procedure according to subclause 5.5.3.3, sending a
TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message with EPS update type IE indicating "combined TA/LA updating
with IMSI attach".

If the UE is attached for EPS and non-EPS services, then the UE shall set the update status to U2 NOT UPDATED if:

   -   the Detach type IE indicates "re-attach required"; or

   -   the Detach type IE indicates "re-attach not required" and no EMM cause IE is included.

When receiving the DETACH REQUEST message and the detach type indicates "re-attach not required" and no EMM
cause IE, or "re-attach not required" and the EMM cause value is not #2 "IMSI unknown in HSS", the UE shall
deactivate the EPS bearer context(s), if any, including the default EPS bearer context locally without peer-to-peer
signalling between the UE and the MME. The UE shall then send a DETACH ACCEPT message to the network and
enter state EMM-DEREGISTERED.

If the detach type indicates "IMSI detach" or "re-attach required", then the UE shall ignore the EMM cause IE if
received.

If the detach type indicates "re-attach not required", the UE shall take the following actions depending on the received
EMM cause value:

   #2 (IMSI unknown in HSS);

       The UE shall handle the MM parameters update status, TMSI, LAI and ciphering key sequence number as
       specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 [13] for the case when a DETACH REQUEST is received with the GMM cause
       with the same value and with detach type set to "re-attach not required". The USIM shall be considered as
       invalid for non-EPS services until switching off or the UICC containing the USIM is removed or the timer
       T3245 expires as described in subclause 5.3.7a. If the UE maintains a counter for "SIM/USIM considered invalid
       for non-GPRS services", then the UE shall set this counter to UE implementation-specific maximum value.

       The UE is still attached for EPS services in the network.

   #3 (Illegal UE);

   #6 (Illegal ME); or

   #8 (EPS services and non-EPS services not allowed);

       The UE shall set the EPS update status to EU3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED (and shall store it according to
       subclause 5.1.3.3) and shall delete any GUTI, last visited registered TAI, TAI list and KSI. The UE shall
       consider the USIM as invalid for EPS services until switching off or the UICC containing the USIM is removed
       or the timer T3245 expires as described in subclause 5.3.7a. The UE shall delete the list of equivalent PLMNs
       and shall enter the state EMM-DEREGISTERED. If the UE maintains a counter for "SIM/USIM considered
       invalid for GPRS services", then the UE shall set this counter to UE implementation-specific maximum value. If

      the UE maintains a counter for "SIM/USIM considered invalid for non-GPRS services", then the UE shall set
      this counter to UE implementation-specific maximum value.

      If A/Gb mode or Iu mode is supported by the UE, the UE shall handle the MM parameters update status, TMSI,
      LAI and ciphering key sequence number and the GMM parameters GMM state, RAI, P-TMSI, P-TMSI
      signature, GPRS ciphering key sequence number and GPRS update status as specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 [13]
      for the case when a DETACH REQUEST is received with the GMM cause with the same value and with detach
      type set to "re-attach not required". The USIM shall also be considered as invalid for non-EPS services until
      switching off or the UICC containing the USIM is removed or the timer T3245 expires as described in
      subclause 5.3.7a.

      If the UE is operating in single-registration mode, the UE shall handle the 5GMM parameters as specified in
      3GPP TS 24.501 [54] for the case when a DEREGISTRATION REQUEST is received with the 5GMM cause
      with the same value and with de-registration type set to "re-registration not required".

   NOTE 2: The possibility to configure a UE so that the radio transceiver for a specific radio access technology is not
           active, although it is implemented in the UE, is out of scope of the present specification.

   #7 (EPS services not allowed);

      The UE shall set the EPS update status to EU3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED (and shall store it according to
      subclause 5.1.3.3) and shall delete any GUTI, last visited registered TAI, TAI list and KSI. The UE shall
      consider the USIM as invalid for EPS services until switching off or the UICC containing the USIM is removed
      or the timer T3245 expires as described in subclause 5.3.7a. The UE shall delete the list of equivalent PLMNs
      and shall enter the state EMM-DEREGISTERED. If the UE maintains a counter for "SIM/USIM considered
      invalid for GPRS services", then the UE shall set this counter to UE implementation-specific maximum value.

      If A/Gb mode or Iu mode is supported by the UE, the UE shall handle the GMM parameters GMM state, RAI,
      P-TMSI, P-TMSI signature, GPRS ciphering key sequence number and GPRS update status as specified in
      3GPP TS 24.008 [13] for the case when a DETACH REQUEST is received with the GMM cause with the same
      value and with detach type set to "re-attach not required".

      A UE operating in CS/PS mode 1 or CS/PS mode 2 of operation which is IMSI attached for non-EPS services is
      still IMSI attached for non-EPS services in the network. The UE operating in CS/PS mode 1 or CS/PS mode 2 of
      operation shall set the update status to U2 NOT UPDATED, shall attempt to select GERAN or UTRAN access
      technology and shall proceed with the appropriate MM specific procedure according to the MM service state.
      The UE shall not reselect E-UTRAN radio access technology until switching off or the UICC containing the
      USIM is removed.

      If the UE is operating in single-registration mode, the UE shall handle the 5GMM parameters as specified in
      3GPP TS 24.501 [54] for the case when a DEREGISTRATION REQUEST is received with the 5GMM cause
      with the same value and with de-registration type set to "re-registration not required".

   #11    (PLMN not allowed);

      The UE shall set the EPS update status to EU3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED (and shall store it according to
      subclause 5.1.3.3) and shall delete any GUTI, last visited registered TAI, TAI list and KSI. The UE shall delete
      the list of equivalent PLMNs, shall reset the attach attempt counter and enter the state EMM-
      DEREGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH.

      The UE shall store the PLMN identity in the "forbidden PLMN list" and if the UE is configured to use timer
      T3245 (see 3GPP TS 24.368 [15A] or 3GPP TS 31.102 [17]) then the UE shall start timer T3245 and proceed as
      described in subclause 5.3.7a. If the message has been successfully integrity checked by the NAS and the UE
      maintains a PLMN-specific attempt counter for that PLMN, then the UE shall set this counter to the UE
      implementation-specific maximum value.

      The UE shall perform a PLMN selection according to 3GPP TS 23.122 [6].

      If A/Gb mode or Iu mode is supported by the UE, the UE shall handle the MM parameters update status, TMSI,
      LAI and ciphering key sequence number and the GMM parameters GMM state, RAI, P-TMSI, P-TMSI
      signature, GPRS ciphering key sequence number, GPRS update status and GPRS attach attempt counter as

      TAI as specified in 3GPP TS 24.501 [54] for the case when a DEREGISTRATION REQUEST is received with
      the 5GMM cause with the same value and with de-registration type set to "re-registration not required".

   #14   (EPS services not allowed in this PLMN);

      The UE shall set the EPS update status to EU3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED (and shall store it according to
      subclause 5.1.3.3). Furthermore, the UE shall delete any GUTI, last visited registered TAI, TAI list and KSI. The
      UE shall reset the attach attempt counter and shall enter the state EMM-DEREGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH.

      The UE shall store the PLMN identity in the "forbidden PLMNs for GPRS service" list and if the UE is
      configured to use timer T3245 (see 3GPP TS 24.368 [15A] or 3GPP TS 31.102 [17]) then the UE shall start
      timer T3245 and proceed as described in subclause 5.3.7a. If the message has been successfully integrity
      checked by the NAS and the UE maintains a PLMN-specific PS-attempt counter for that PLMN, then the UE
      shall set this counter to the UE implementation-specific maximum value.

      A UE in PS mode 1 or PS mode 2 of operation shall delete the list of equivalent PLMNs and perform a PLMN
      selection according to 3GPP TS 23.122 [6].

       when a DETACH REQUEST is received with the GMM cause with the same value and with detach type set to
       "re-attach not required".

Other EMM cause values or if no EMM cause IE is included is considered as abnormal cases. The behaviour of the UE
in those cases is described in subclause 5.5.2.3.4.

5.5.2.3.3            Network initiated detach procedure completion by the network
The network shall stop timer T3422 upon receipt of the DETACH ACCEPT message. If the Detach type IE indicates
"IMSI detach", or "re-attach not required" and the EMM cause value is #2 "IMSI unknown in HSS", the network shall
not change the current EMM state; otherwise the network shall enter state EMM-DEREGISTERED.

5.5.2.3.4            Abnormal cases in the UE
The following abnormal cases can be identified:

   a) Transmission failure of DETACH ACCEPT message indication from lower layers

       The detach procedure shall be progressed and the UE shall send the DETACH ACCEPT message.

   b) DETACH REQUEST, other EMM cause values than those treated in subclause 5.5.2.3.2 or no EMM cause IE is
      included, and the Detach type IE indicates "re-attach not required"

       The UE shall delete any GUTI, TAI list, last visited registered TAI, list of equivalent PLMNs, KSI, shall set the
       update status to EU2 NOT UPDATED and shall start timer T3402.

       A UE operating in CS/PS mode 1 or CS/PS mode 2 of operation which is IMSI attached for non-EPS services is
       still IMSI attached for non-EPS services and shall set the update status to U2 NOT UPDATED.

   -   A UE not supporting A/Gb mode or Iu mode, or operating in PS mode of operation may enter the state EMM-
       DEREGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH in order to perform a PLMN selection according to 3GPP TS 23.122 [6];
       otherwise the UE shall enter the state EMM-DEREGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-ATTACH.

       A UE supporting A/Gb mode or Iu mode and operating in CS/PS mode 1 of operation or CS/PS mode 2 of
       operation shall

       -   enter the state EMM-DEREGISTERED and attempt to select GERAN or UTRAN radio access technology
           and proceed with the appropriate MM or GMM specific procedures. In this case, the UE may disable the E-
           UTRA capability (see subclause 4.5); or

       -   enter the state EMM-DEREGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH in order to perform a PLMN selection according to

5.5.2.3.5            Abnormal cases on the network side
The following abnormal cases can be identified:

   a) T3422 time-out

       On the first expiry of the timer, the network shall retransmit the DETACH REQUEST message and shall start
       timer T3422. This retransmission is repeated four times, i.e. on the fifth expiry of timer T3422, the detach
       procedure shall be aborted. If the detach type is "IMSI detach", or "re-attach not required" and the EMM cause
       value is #2 "IMSI unknown in HSS", the network shall not change the current EMM state; otherwise the network
       shall change to state EMM-DEREGISTERED.

   b) Lower layer failure

       The detach procedure is aborted. If the detach type indicates "IMSI detach", or "re-attach not required" and the
       EMM cause value is #2 "IMSI unknown in HSS", the network shall not change the current EMM state;
       otherwise the network shall change to state EMM-DEREGISTERED.

   c) Detach procedure collision

      If the network receives a DETACH REQUEST message with "switch off" indication, before the network
      initiated detach procedure has been completed, both procedures shall be considered completed.

      If the network receives a DETACH REQUEST message without "switch off" indication, before the network
      initiated detach procedure has been completed, the network shall send a DETACH ACCEPT message to the UE.

   d) Detach and attach procedure collision

      If the network receives an ATTACH REQUEST message before the network initiated detach procedure with
      detach type "re-attach not required" and the EMM cause value not #2 "IMSI unknown in HSS", has been
      completed, the network shall ignore the ATTACH REQUEST message. If the Detach type IE, sent in the
      DETACH REQUEST message, indicates "re-attach required" the detach procedure is aborted and the attach
      procedure shall be progressed after the EPS bearer context(s) have been deleted. If the Detach type IE, sent in
      DETACH REQUEST message, indicates "IMSI detach", or "re-attach not required" and the EMM cause value is
      #2 "IMSI unknown in HSS", the detach procedure is aborted and the attach procedure shall be progressed.

   e) Detach and tracking area updating procedure collision

      If the Detach type IE, sent in DETACH REQUEST message, indicates "re-attach not required" with EMM cause
      other than #2 "IMSI unknown in HSS" or indicates "re-attach required", and the network receives a TRACKING
      AREA UPDATE REQUEST message before the network initiated detach procedure has been completed, the
      detach procedure shall be progressed, i.e. the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message shall be
      ignored.

      If the Detach type IE, sent in DETACH REQUEST message, indicates "re-attach not required" with EMM cause
      #2 "IMSI unknown in HSS" or indicates "IMSI detach" and the network receives a TRACKING AREA
      UPDATE REQUEST message before the network initiated detach procedure has been completed, the network
      shall abort the detach procedure, shall stop T3422 and shall progress the tracking area updating procedure.

   f) Detach and service request procedure collision

      If the network receives a SERVICE REQUEST message or an EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST message for
      packet services before the network initiated detach procedure has been completed (e.g. the DETACH REQUEST
      message is pending to be sent to the UE) and the DETACH REQUEST contains detach type "re-attach not
      required" with EMM cause #2 "IMSI unknown in HSS" or detach type "IMSI detach", the network shall
      progress both procedures. If the DETACH REQUEST message contains detach type "re-attach not required"
      with EMM cause other than #2 "IMSI unknown in HSS" or detach type "re-attach required", the network shall
      progress the detach procedure.

      If the network receives an EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST message for CS fallback, but not for CS fallback
      for emergency call, before the network initiated detach procedure has been completed (e.g. the DETACH
      REQUEST message is pending to be sent to the UE) and the DETACH REQUEST contains detach type "re-
      attach not required" with EMM cause #2 "IMSI unknown in HSS" or detach type "IMSI detach", the network
      shall ignore the EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST message and progress the detach procedure.

      If the network receives an EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST message for CS fallback for emergency call
      before the network initiated detach procedure has been completed (e.g. the DETACH REQUEST message is
      pending to be sent to the UE) and the DETACH REQUEST contains detach type "re-attach not required" with
      EMM cause #2 "IMSI unknown in HSS" or detach type "IMSI detach", the network shall progress both
      procedures.

   g) Lower layers indication of non-delivered NAS PDU due to handover

      If the DETACH REQUEST message could not be delivered due to an intra MME handover and the target TA is
      included in the TAI list, then upon successful completion of the intra MME handover the MME shall retransmit
      the DETACH REQUEST message. If a failure of the handover procedure is reported by the lower layer and the
      S1 signalling connection exists, the MME shall retransmit the DETACH REQUEST message.

5.5.3         Tracking area updating procedure (S1 mode only)

5.5.3.1           General
The tracking area updating procedure is always initiated by the UE and is used for the following purposes:

   -   normal tracking area updating to update the registration of the actual tracking area of a UE in the network;

   -   combined tracking area updating to update the registration of the actual tracking area for a UE in CS/PS mode 1
       or CS/PS mode 2 of operation;

   -   periodic tracking area updating to periodically notify the availability of the UE to the network;

   -   IMSI attach for non-EPS services when the UE is attached for EPS services. This procedure is used by a UE in
       CS/PS mode 1 or CS/PS mode 2 of operation;

   -   in various cases of inter-system change from Iu mode to S1 mode or from A/Gb mode to S1 mode;

   -   in various cases of inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode if the UE operates in single-registration mode
       and as described in 3GPP TS 24.501 [54];

   -   S101 mode to S1 mode inter-system change;

   -   MME load balancing;

   -   to update certain UE specific parameters in the network;

   -   recovery from certain error cases;

   -   to indicate that the UE enters S1 mode after CS fallback or 1xCS fallback;

   -   to indicate to the network that the UE has selected a CSG cell whose CSG identity and associated PLMN identity
       are not included in the UE's Allowed CSG list or in the UE's Operator CSG list;

   -   to indicate the current radio access technology to the network for the support of terminating access domain
       selection for voice calls or voice sessions; and

   -   to indicate to the network that the UE has locally released EPS bearer context(s).

Details on the conditions for the UE to initiate the tracking area updating procedure are specified in subclause 5.5.3.2.2
and subclause 5.5.3.3.2.

While a UE has a PDN connection for emergency bearer services, the UE shall not perform manual CSG selection.

If control plane CIoT EPS optimization is not used by the UE, a UE initiating the tracking area updating procedure in
EMM-IDLE mode may request the network to re-establish the radio and S1 bearers for all active EPS bearer contexts
during the procedure. If control plane CIoT EPS optimization is used by the UE, a UE initiating the tracking area
updating procedure in EMM-IDLE mode may request the network to re-establish the radio and S1 bearers for all active
EPS bearer contexts associated with PDN connections established without control plane only indication during the
procedure.

In a shared network, the UE shall choose one of the PLMN identities as specified in 3GPP TS 23.122 [6]. The UE shall
construct the TAI of the cell from this chosen PLMN identity and the TAC received for this PLMN identity on the
broadcast system information. The chosen PLMN identity shall be indicated to the E-UTRAN (see
3GPP TS 36.331 [22]). Whenever a TRACKING AREA UPDATE REJECT message with the EMM cause #11 "PLMN
not allowed" is received by the UE, the chosen PLMN identity shall be stored in the "forbidden PLMN list" and if the
UE is configured to use timer T3245 (see 3GPP TS 24.368 [15A] or 3GPP TS 31.102 [17]) then the UE shall start timer
T3245 and proceed as described in subclause 5.3.7a. Whenever a TRACKING AREA UPDATE REJECT message with
the EMM cause #14 "EPS services not allowed in this PLMN" is received by the UE, the chosen PLMN identity shall
be stored in the "forbidden PLMNs for GPRS service". Whenever a TRACKING AREA UPDATE REJECT message is
received by the UE with the EMM cause #12 "tracking area not allowed", #13 "roaming not allowed in this tracking
area", or #15 "no suitable cells in tracking Area", the constructed TAI shall be stored in the suitable list.

In a shared network, if TRACKING AREA UPDATE REJECT is received as a response to a tracking area update
procedure initiated in EMM-CONNECTED mode, the UE need not update forbidden lists.

A tracking area updating attempt counter is used to limit the number of subsequently rejected tracking area update
attempts. The tracking area updating attempt counter shall be incremented as specified in subclause 5.5.3.2.6.
Depending on the value of the tracking area updating attempt counter, specific actions shall be performed. The tracking
area updating attempt counter shall be reset when:

   -   a normal or periodic tracking area updating or a combined tracking area updating procedure is successfully
       completed;

   -   a normal or periodic tracking area updating or a combined tracking area updating procedure is rejected with
       EMM cause #11, #12, #13, #14, #15, #25 or #35:

   -   a combined attach procedure or a combined tracking area updating procedure is completed for EPS services only
       with cause #2 or #18;or

   -   a new PLMN is selected.

Additionally the tracking area updating attempt counter shall be reset when the UE is in substate EMM-
REGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-UPDATE or EMM-REGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-UPDATE-MM, and:

   -   a new tracking area is entered;

   -   timer T3402 expires; or

   -   timer T3346 is started.

5.5.3.2          Normal and periodic tracking area updating procedure

5.5.3.2.1            General
The periodic tracking area updating procedure is controlled in the UE by timer T3412. When timer T3412 expires, the
periodic tracking area updating procedure is started. Start and reset of timer T3412 is described in subclause 5.3.5.

5.5.3.2.2            Normal and periodic tracking area updating procedure initiation
The UE in state EMM-REGISTERED shall initiate the tracking area updating procedure by sending a TRACKING
AREA UPDATE REQUEST message to the MME,

   a) when the UE detects entering a tracking area that is not in the list of tracking areas that the UE previously
      registered in the MME, unless the UE is configured for "AttachWithIMSI" as specified in
      3GPP TS 24.368 [15A] or 3GPP TS 31.102 [17] and is entering a tracking area in a new PLMN that is neither
      the registered PLMN nor in the list of equivalent PLMNs;

   e) when the UE receives an indication from the lower layers that the RRC connection was released with cause "load
      balancing TAU required";

   f) when the UE deactivated EPS bearer context(s) locally while in EMM-REGISTERED, because it could not
      establish a NAS signalling connection, and then returns to EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE and no
      EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST message, CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message or DETACH
      REQUEST message with detach type is "EPS detach" or "combined EPS/IMSI detach" is pending to be sent by
      the UE;

   g) when the UE changes the UE network capability information or the MS network capability information or both;

   h) when the UE changes the UE specific DRX parameter;

   i) when the UE receives an indication of "RRC Connection failure" from the lower layers and has no signalling or
      user uplink data pending (i.e when the lower layer requests NAS signalling connection recovery);

   j) when the UE enters S1 mode after 1xCS fallback or 1xSRVCC;

If the UE is using only control plane CIoT EPS optimization, the case i only applies to the case that the UE has
indicated to the network that subsequent to the uplink data transmission a downlink data transmission is expected during
the transport of uplink user data via the control plane procedure (see subclause 6.6.4).

If the UE has to request resources for ProSe direct discovery or Prose direct communication (see 3GPP TS 36.331 [22]),
then the UE shall set the "active" flag to 1 in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message.

If the UE does not have any established PDN connection, the "active" flag in the EPS update type IE shall be set to 0.

When the UE has user data pending and performs an inter-system change from S101 mode to S1 mode to a tracking
area included in the TAI list stored in the UE, the UE shall perform a service request procedure instead of a tracking
area updating procedure.

When initiating a tracking area updating procedure while in S1 mode, the UE shall use the current EPS NAS integrity
key to integrity protect the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, unless the UE is performing inter-
system change from N1 mode to S1 mode.

In order to indicate its UE specific DRX parameter while in E-UTRAN coverage, the UE shall send the TRACKING
AREA UPDATE REQUEST message containing the UE specific DRX parameter in the DRX parameter IE to the
network, with the exception of the case if the UE had indicated its DRX parameter (3GPP TS 24.008 [13]) to the
network while in GERAN or UTRAN coverage. In this case, when the UE enters E-UTRAN coverage and initiates a
tracking area updating procedure, the UE shall not include the UE specific DRX parameter in the DRX parameter IE in
the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message.

   NOTE 4: The UE specific DRX parameter is not used by the E-UTRAN for paging from NB-IoT cells (see
           3GPP TS 23.401 [10] and 3GPP TS 36.304 [21]).

If the UE supports eDRX and requests the use of eDRX, the UE shall include the extended DRX parameters IE in the
TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message.

If the UE supports PSM and requests the use of PSM, the UE shall include the T3324 value IE with a requested timer
value in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message. When the UE includes the T3324 value IE and the UE
indicates support for extended periodic timer value in the MS network feature support IE, it may also include the T3412
extended value IE to request a particular T3412 value to be allocated.

If a UE supporting CIoT EPS optimizations in NB-S1 mode initiates the tracking area updating procedure for EPS
services and "SMS only", the UE shall indicate "SMS only" in the Additional update type IE and shall set the EPS
update type IE to "TA updating".

If the UE supports S1-U data transfer and multiple user plane radio bearers (see 3GPP TS 36.306 [44],
3GPP TS 36.331 [22]) in NB-S1 mode, then the UE shall set the Multiple DRB support bit to "Multiple DRB
supported" in the UE network capability IE of the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message.

If the UE has to request resources for V2X communication over PC5 (see 3GPP TS 23.285 [47]), then the UE shall set
the "active" flag to 1 in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message.

After sending the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message to the MME, the UE shall start timer T3430 and
enter state EMM-TRACKING-AREA-UPDATING-INITIATED (see example in figure 5.5.3.2.2.1). If timer T3402 is
currently running, the UE shall stop timer T3402. If timer T3411 is currently running, the UE shall stop timer T3411. If
timer T3442 is currently running, the UE shall stop timer T3442.

For all cases except cases z and zd:

   1) if the UE supports neither A/Gb mode nor Iu mode, the UE shall include a valid GUTI in the Old GUTI IE in the
      TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message. In addition, the UE shall include Old GUTI type IE with
      GUTI type set to "native GUTI"; or

   2) if the UE supports A/Gb mode or Iu mode or both, the UE shall handle the Old GUTI IE as follows:

       -   If the TIN indicates "P-TMSI" and the UE holds a valid P-TMSI and RAI, the UE shall map the P-TMSI and
           RAI into the Old GUTI IE, and include Old GUTI type IE with GUTI type set to "mapped GUTI". If a P-
           TMSI signature is associated with the P-TMSI, the UE shall include it in the Old P-TMSI signature IE.
           Additionally, if the UE holds a valid GUTI, the UE shall indicate the GUTI in the Additional GUTI IE.

If a UE has established PDN connection(s) and uplink user data pending to be sent via user plane when it initiates the
tracking area updating procedure, or uplink signalling not related to the tracking area updating procedure when the UE
does not support control plane CIoT EPS optimization, it may also set an "active" flag in the TRACKING AREA
UPDATE REQUEST message to indicate the request to establish the user plane to the network and to keep the NAS
signalling connection after the completion of the tracking area updating procedure.

If a UE is using EPS services with control plane CIoT EPS optimization and has user data pending to be sent via control
plane over MME but no user data pending to be sent via user plane, or uplink signalling not related to the tracking area
updating procedure, the UE may set a "signalling active" flag in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message

5.5.3.2.3            EMM common procedure initiation
If the network receives a TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message containing the Old GUTI type IE, and the
network does not follow the use of the most significant bit of the <MME group id> to distinguish the node type as
specified in 3GPP TS 23.003 [2], subclause 2.8.2.2.2, the network shall use the Old GUTI type IE to determine whether
the mobile identity included in the Old GUTI IE is a native GUTI or a mapped GUTI.

During the tracking area updating procedure, the MME may initiate EMM common procedures, e.g. the EMM
authentication and security mode control procedures.

The MME may be configured to skip the authentication procedure even if no EPS security context is available and
proceed directly to the execution of the security mode control procedure as specified in subclause 5.4.3, during a
tracking area updating procedure for a UE that has only a PDN connection for emergency bearer services.

The MME shall not initiate an EMM authentication procedure before completion of the tracking area updating
procedure, if the following conditions apply:

   a) the UE initiated the tracking area updating procedure after handover or inter-system handover to S1 mode;

   b) the target cell is a shared network cell; and

       -   the UE has provided its GUTI in the Old GUTI IE or the Additional GUTI IE in the TRACKING AREA
           UPDATE REQUEST message, and the PLMN identity included in the GUTI is different from the selected
           PLMN identity of the target cell; or

       -   the UE has mapped the P-TMSI and RAI into the Old GUTI IE and not included an Additional GUTI IE in

           different from the selected PLMN identity of the target cell.

5.5.3.2.4            Normal and periodic tracking area updating procedure accepted by the network
If the tracking area update request has been accepted by the network, the MME shall send a TRACKING AREA
UPDATE ACCEPT message to the UE. If the MME assigns a new GUTI for the UE, a GUTI shall be included in the
TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message. In this case, the MME shall start timer T3450 and enter state EMM-
COMMON-PROCEDURE-INITIATED as described in subclause 5.4.1. The MME may include a new TAI list for the
UE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message. The MME shall not assign a TAI list containing both
tracking areas in NB-S1 mode and tracking areas in WB-S1 mode.

   NOTE 1: When assigning the TAI list, the MME can take into account the eNodeB's capability of support of CIoT
           EPS optimization.

If the UE has included the UE network capability IE or the MS network capability IE or both in the TRACKING AREA
UPDATE REQUEST message, the MME shall store all octets received from the UE, up to the maximum length defined
for the respective information element.

   NOTE 2: This information is forwarded to the new MME during inter-MME handover or to the new SGSN during
           inter-system handover to A/Gb mode or Iu mode.

   NOTE 3: For further details concerning the handling of the MS network capability and UE network capability in
           the MME see also 3GPP TS 23.401 [10].

In NB-S1 mode, if the tracking area update request is accepted by the network, the MME shall set the EMC BS bit to
zero in the EPS network feature support IE included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message to indicate
that support of emergency bearer services in NB-S1 mode is not available.

If a UE radio capability information update needed IE is included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST
message, the MME shall delete the stored UE radio capability information, if any.

If the UE specific DRX parameter was included in the DRX Parameter IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE
REQUEST message, the network shall replace any stored UE specific DRX parameter with the received parameter and
use it for the downlink transfer of signalling and user data.

If the UE requests "control plane CIoT EPS optimization" in the Additional update type IE, indicates support of control
plane CIoT EPS optimization in the UE network capability IE and the MME decides to accept the requested CIoT EPS
optimization and the tracking area update request, the MME shall indicate "control plane CIoT EPS optimization
supported" in the EPS network feature support IE.

In NB-S1 mode, if the UE requested "SMS only" in the Additional update type IE, supports NB-S1 mode only and the
MME decides to accept the tracking area update request for EPS services and "SMS only", the MME shall indicate
"SMS only" in the Additional update result IE and shall set the EPS update type IE to "TA updating" in the
TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message.

The MME shall include the extended DRX parameters IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message only
if the extended DRX parameters IE was included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, and the
MME supports and accepts the use of eDRX.

If the UE indicates support for EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE

MME shall use the information whether the peer entity supports EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection as
specified in the present clause 5 and in clause 6.

If an EPS bearer context status IE is included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, the MME shall
deactivate all those EPS bearer contexts locally (without peer-to-peer signalling between the MME and the UE) which
are in ESM state BEARER CONTEXT ACTIVE or BEARER CONTEXT MODIFY PENDING on the network side,
but are indicated by the UE as being in ESM state BEARER CONTEXT INACTIVE. If a default EPS bearer context is
marked as inactive in the EPS bearer context status IE included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST
message, and this default bearer is not associated with the last remaining PDN connection of the UE in the MME, the
MME shall locally deactivate all EPS bearer contexts associated to the PDN connection with the default EPS bearer
context without peer-to-peer ESM signalling to the UE. If the default bearer is associated with the last remaining PDN
connection of the UE in the MME, and EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is supported by the UE and the
MME, the MME shall locally deactivate all EPS bearer contexts associated to the PDN connection with the default EPS
bearer context without peer-to-peer ESM signalling to the UE.

If the EPS bearer context status IE is included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST, the MME shall include
an EPS bearer context status IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, indicating which EPS bearer
contexts are active in the MME except for the case no EPS bearer context exists on the network side.

If the EPS update type IE included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message indicates "periodic
updating", and the UE was previously successfully attached for EPS and non-EPS services, subject to operator policies
the MME should allocate a TAI list that does not span more than one location area.

The MME shall indicate "combined TA/LA updated" or "combined TA/LA updated and ISR activated" in the EPS
update result IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, if the following conditions apply:

   -   the EPS update type IE included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message indicates "periodic
       updating" and the UE was previously successfully attached for EPS and non-EPS services; and

   -   location area updating for non-EPS services as specified in 3GPP TS 29.118 [16A] is successful.

The MME may include T3412 extended value IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message only if the
UE indicates support of the extended periodic timer T3412 in the MS network feature support IE in the TRACKING
AREA UPDATE REQUEST message.

The MME shall include the T3324 value IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message only if the T3324
value IE was included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, and the MME supports and accepts
the use of PSM.

If the MME supports and accepts the use of PSM, and the UE included the T3412extended value IE in the TRACKING
AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, then the MME shall take into account the T3412 value requested when
providing the T3412 value IE and the T3412 extended value IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT
message.

   NOTE 4: Besides the value requested by the MS, the MME can take local configuration or subscription data
           provided by the HSS into account when selecting a value for T3412 (see 3GPP TS 23.401 [10]
           subclause 4.3.17.3).

If the MME includes the T3324 value IE indicating a value other than deactivated in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE
ACCEPT message, then the MME shall indicate in the EPS update result IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE
ACCEPT message that ISR is not activated.

Also during the tracking area updating procedure without "active" flag, if the MME has deactivated EPS bearer
context(s) locally for any reason, the MME shall inform the UE of the deactivated EPS bearer context(s) by including
the EPS bearer context status IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message.

Also during the tracking area updating procedure with "active" flag, if the MME has deactivated EPS bearer context(s)
associated with control plane only indication locally for any reason, the MME shall inform the UE of the deactivated
EPS bearer context(s) by including the EPS bearer context status IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT
message.

If the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message contains the DCN-ID IE, then the UE shall store the included
DCN-ID value together with the PLMN code of the registered PLMN in a DCN-ID list in a non-volatile memory in the
ME as specified in annex C.

If due to regional subscription restrictions or access restrictions the UE is not allowed to access the TA, but it has a
PDN connection for emergency bearer services established, the MME may accept the TRACKING AREA UPDATE
REQUEST message and deactivate all non-emergency EPS bearer contexts by initiating an EPS bearer context
deactivation procedure when the tracking area updating procedure is initiated in EMM-CONNECTED mode. When the
tracking area updating procedure is initiated in EMM-IDLE mode, the MME locally deactivates all non-emergency EPS
bearer contexts and informs the UE via the EPS bearer context status IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT
message. The MME shall not deactivate the emergency EPS bearer contexts. The network shall consider the UE to be
attached for emergency bearer services only and shall indicate in the EPS update result IE in the TRACKING AREA
UPDATE ACCEPT message that ISR is not activated.

If a TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message is received from a UE with a LIPA PDN connection, and if:

   -   a GW Transport Layer Address IE value identifying a L-GW is provided by the lower layer together with the
       TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, and the P-GW address included in the EPS bearer context
       of the LIPA PDN Connection is different from the provided GW Transport Layer Address IE value (see
       3GPP TS 36.413 [23]); or

   -   no GW Transport Layer Address is provided together with the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST
       message by the lower layer,

then the MME locally deactivates all EPS bearer contexts associated with the LIPA PDN connection. Furthermore, the
MME takes one of the following actions:

   -   if no active EPS bearer contexts remain for the UE, the MME shall not accept the tracking area update request as
       specified in subclause 5.5.3.2.5;

   -   if active EPS bearer contexts remain for the UE and the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message is
       accepted, the MME informs the UE via the EPS bearer context status IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE
       ACCEPT message that EPS bearer contexts were locally deactivated.

If a TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message is received from a UE with a SIPTO at the local network PDN
connection, is accepted by the network, the following different cases can be distinguished:

   1) If the PDN connection is a SIPTO at the local network PDN connection with collocated L-GW and if:

       -   a SIPTO L-GW Transport Layer Address IE value identifying a L-GW is provided by the lower layer
           together with the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, and the P-GW address included in the
           EPS bearer context of the SIPTO at the local network PDN connection is different from the provided SIPTO
           L-GW Transport Layer Address IE value (see 3GPP TS 36.413 [23]); or

       -   no SIPTO L-GW Transport Layer Address is provided together with the TRACKING AREA UPDATE
           REQUEST message by the lower layer,

   2) If the PDN connection is a SIPTO at the local network PDN connection with stand-alone GW and if:

       -   a LHN-ID value is provided by the lower layer together with the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST
           message, and the LHN-ID stored in the EPS bearer context of the SIPTO at the local network PDN
           connection is different from the provided LHN-ID value (see 3GPP TS 36.413 [23]); or

       -   no LHN-ID value is provided together with the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message by the
           lower layer,

then the MME takes one of the following actions:

   -   if the SIPTO at the local network PDN connection is the last remaining PDN connection for the UE, and EMM-
       REGISTERED without PDN connection is not supported by the UE or the MME, then the MME shall upon
       completion of the tracking area updating procedure detach the UE by using detach type "re-attach required" (see
       subclause 5.5.2.3.1);

   -   if the SIPTO at the local network PDN connection is the last remaining PDN connection for the UE, and EMM-
       REGISTERED without PDN connection is supported by the UE and the MME, then the MME shall upon
       completion of the tracking area updating procedure initiate an EPS bearer context deactivation procedure with
       ESM cause #39 "reactivation requested"for the default EPS bearer context of the SIPTO at the local network
       PDN connection (see subclause 6.4.4.2); and

   -   if a PDN connection remains that is not SIPTO at the local network PDN connection, the MME shall upon
       completion of the tracking area updating procedure initiate an EPS bearer context deactivation procedure with
       ESM cause #39 "reactivation requested"for the default EPS bearer context of each SIPTO at the local network
       PDN connection (see subclause 6.4.4.2);

For a SIPTO at the local network PDN connection with stand-alone GW, the conditions to deactivate ISR are specified
in 3GPP TS 23.401 [10], subclause 4.3.5.6.

For a shared network, the TAIs included in the TAI list can contain different PLMN identities. The MME indicates the
selected core network operator PLMN identity to the UE in the GUTI (see 3GPP TS 23.251 [8B]).

If the "active" flag is included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message and control plane CIoT EPS
optimization is not used by the MME, the MME shall re-establish the radio and S1 bearers for all active EPS bearer
contexts. If the "active" flag is included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message and control plane
CIoT EPS optimization is used by the MME, the MME shall re-establish the radio and S1 bearers for all active EPS
bearer contexts associated with PDN connections established without Control plane only indication.

If the "signalling active" flag is included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message and control plane
CIoT EPS optimization is used by the MME, the MME shall not immediately release the NAS signalling connection
after the completion of the tracking area updating procedure.

If the "active" flag is not included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message and control plane CIoT
EPS optimization is not used by the MME, the MME may also re-establish the radio and S1 bearers for all active EPS
bearer contexts due to downlink pending data or downlink pending signalling. If the "active" flag is not included in the
TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message and control plane CIoT EPS optimization is used by the MME, the
MME may also re-establish the radio and S1 bearers for all active EPS bearer contexts associated with PDN
connections established without Control plane only indication due to downlink pending data or downlink pending
signalling.

If the MME supports NB-S1 mode, Non-IP PDN type, or inter-system change with 5GS, then the MME shall support
the extended protocol configuration options IE.

If the MME supports the extended protocol configuration options IE and the UE indicated support of the extended
protocol configuration options IE, then the MME shall set the ePCO bit to "extended protocol configuration options
supported" in the EPS network feature support IE of the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message.

If the UE indicates support for restriction on use of enhanced coverage in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST
message, and the network decides to restrict the use of enhanced coverage for the UE, then the MME shall set the
RestrictEC bit to "Use of enhanced coverage is restricted" in the EPS network feature support IE of the TRACKING
AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message.

The MME may indicate the header compression configuration status IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT
message for each established EPS bearer context using control plane CIoT EPS optimisation.

If the UE has indicated support for the control plane data back-off timer, and the MME decides to activate the
congestion control for transport of user data via the control plane, then the MME shall include the T3448 value IE in the
TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message.

If the UE indicates support for dual connectivity with NR in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message,
and the MME decides to restrict the use of dual connectivity with NR for the UE, then the MME shall set the
RestrictDCNR bit to "Use of dual connectivity with NR is restricted" in the EPS network feature support IE of the
TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message.

If the UE indicates support for N1 mode in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message and the MME
supports inter-system interworking with 5GS, the MME may set the IWK N26 bit to either:

   -   "interworking without N26 not supported" if the MME supports N26 interface; or

   -   "interworking without N26 supported" if the MME does not support N26 interface

in the EPS network feature support IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message.

If due to operator policies unsecured redirection to a GERAN cell is not allowed in the current PLMN, the MME shall
set the redir-policy bit to "Unsecured redirection to GERAN not allowed" in the Network policy IE of the TRACKING
AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message.

If the UE has indicated support for service gap control, a service gap time value is available in the EMM context, the
MME may include the T3447 value IE set to the service gap time value in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT
message.

If the network supports signalling for a maximum number of 15 EPS bearer contexts and the UE indicated support of
signalling for a maximum number of 15 EPS bearer contexts in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message,
then the MME shall set the 15 bearers bit to "Signalling for a maximum number of 15 EPS bearer contexts supported"
in the EPS network feature support IE of the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message.

If the UE requests ciphering keys for ciphered broadcast assistance data in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE
REQUEST message and the MME has valid ciphering key data applicable to the UE's subscription, then the MME shall
include the ciphering key data in the Ciphering key data IE of the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message.

Upon receiving a TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, the UE shall stop timer T3430, reset the service
request attempt counter, tracking area updating attempt counter, enter state EMM-REGISTERED and set the EPS
update status to EU1 UPDATED. If the message contains a GUTI, the UE shall use this GUTI as new temporary
identity for EPS services and shall store the new GUTI. If no GUTI was included by the MME in the TRACKING
AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, the old GUTI shall be used. If the UE receives a new TAI list in the TRACKING
AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, the UE shall consider the new TAI list as valid and the old TAI list as invalid;
otherwise, the UE shall consider the old TAI list as valid.

If the UE receives the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message from a PLMN for which a PLMN-specific
attempt counter or PLMN-specific PS-attempt counter is maintained (see subclause 5.3.7b), then the UE shall reset
these counters. If the UE maintains a counter for "SIM/USIM considered invalid for GPRS services", then the UE shall
reset this counter.

If the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message contains the T3412 extended value IE, then the UE shall use
the T3412 extended value IE as periodic tracking area update timer (T3412). If the TRACKING AREA UPDATE
ACCEPT contains T3412 value IE, but not T3412 extended value IE, then the UE shall use value in T3412 value IE as
periodic tracking area update timer (T3412). If neither T3412 value IE nor T3412 extended value IE is included, the UE
shall use the value currently stored, e.g. from a prior ATTACH ACCEPT or TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT
message.

If the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message contains the T3324 value IE, then the UE shall use the timer
value for T3324 as specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 [13], subclause 4.7.2.8.

If the UE had initiated the tracking area updating procedure in EMM-IDLE mode to perform an inter-system change
from A/Gb mode or Iu mode to S1 mode and the nonceUE was included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE
REQUEST message, the UE shall delete the nonceUE upon receipt of the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT
message.

If an EPS bearer context status IE is included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, the UE shall
deactivate all those EPS bearers contexts locally (without peer-to-peer signalling between the UE and the MME) which
are active in the UE, but are indicated by the MME as being inactive. If a default EPS bearer context is marked as
inactive in the EPS bearer context status IE included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, and this
default bearer is not associated with the last remaining PDN connection in the UE, the UE shall locally deactivate all
EPS bearer contexts associated to the PDN connection with the default EPS bearer context without peer-to-peer ESM
signalling to the MME. If only the PDN connection for emergency bearer services remains established, the UE shall
consider itself attached for emergency bearer services only. If the default bearer is associated with the last remaining
PDN connection of the UE in the MME, and EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is supported by the UE
and the MME, the UE shall locally deactivate all EPS bearer contexts associated to the PDN connection with the default
EPS bearer context without peer-to-peer ESM signalling to the UE.

If an EPS bearer context status IE is included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, the UE may
choose to ignore all those EPS bearers which are indicated by the MME as being active but are inactive at the UE.

The MME may also include a list of equivalent PLMNs in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message. Each
entry in the list contains a PLMN code (MCC+MNC). The UE shall store the list as provided by the network, and if
there is no PDN connection for emergency bearer services established, the UE shall remove from the list any PLMN
code that is already in the list of "forbidden PLMNs" or in the list of "forbidden PLMNs for GPRS service". If the UE is
not attached for emergency bearer services and there is a PDN connection for emergency bearer services established,
the UE shall remove from the list of equivalent PLMNs any PLMN code present in the list of forbidden PLMNs or in
the list of "forbidden PLMNs for GPRS service" when the PDN connection for emergency bearer services is released.
In addition, the UE shall add to the stored list the PLMN code of the registered PLMN that sent the list. The UE shall

replace the stored list on each receipt of the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message. If the TRACKING
AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message does not contain a list, then the UE shall delete the stored list.

If the UE is not attached for emergency bearer services and if the PLMN identity of the registered PLMN is a member
of the list of "forbidden PLMNs" or the list of "forbidden PLMNs for GPRS service", any such PLMN identity shall be
deleted from the corresponding list(s).

The network may also indicate in the EPS update result IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message that
ISR is active. If the UE is attached for emergency bearer services, the network shall indicate in the EPS update result IE
in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message that ISR is not activated. If the TRACKING AREA UPDATE
ACCEPT message contains:

   i) no indication that ISR is activated, the UE shall set the TIN to "GUTI" and shall stop the periodic routing area
      update timer T3312 or T3323, if running;

   ii) an indication that ISR is activated, then:

       -   if the UE is required to perform routing area updating for IMS voice termination as specified in
           3GPP TS 24.008 [13], annex P.5, the UE shall set the TIN to "GUTI" and shall stop the periodic routing area
           update timer T3312 or T3323, if running;

       -   if the UE had initiated the tracking area updating procedure due to a change in UE network capability or
           change in DRX parameters, the UE shall set the TIN to "GUTI" and shall stop the periodic routing area
           update timer T3312 or T3323, if running;

       -   if the UE had initiated the tracking area updating procedure due to a change in the UE's usage setting or the
           voice domain preference for E-UTRAN, the UE shall set the TIN to "GUTI" and shall stop the periodic
           routing area update timer T3312 or T3323, if running; or

       -   the UE shall regard a previously assigned P-TMSI and RAI as valid and registered with the network. If the
           TIN currently indicates "P-TMSI" and the periodic routing area update timer T3312 is running or is
           deactivated, the UE shall set the TIN to "RAT-related TMSI". If the TIN currently indicates "P-TMSI" and
           the periodic routing area update timer T3312 has already expired, the UE shall set the TIN to "GUTI".

The network informs the UE about the support of specific features, such as IMS voice over PS session, location services
(EPC-LCS, CS-LCS), emergency bearer services, or CIoT EPS optimizations, in the EPS network feature support
information element. In a UE with IMS voice over PS capability, the IMS voice over PS session indicator and the
emergency bearer services indicator shall be provided to the upper layers. The upper layers take the IMS voice over PS
session indicator into account as specified in 3GPP TS 23.221 [8A], subclause 7.2a and subclause 7.2b, when selecting
the access domain for voice sessions or calls. When initiating an emergency call, the upper layers also take both the
IMS voice over PS session indicator and the emergency bearer services indicator into account for the access domain
selection. When the UE determines via the IMS voice over PS session indicator that the network does not support IMS
voice over PS sessions in S1 mode, then the UE shall not locally release any persistent EPS bearer context. When the
UE determines via the emergency bearer services indicator that the network does not support emergency bearer services
in S1 mode, then the UE shall not locally release any emergency EPS bearer context if there is a radio bearer associated
with that context. In a UE with LCS capability, location services indicators (EPC-LCS, CS-LCS) shall be provided to
the upper layers. When MO-LR procedure is triggered by the UE's application, those indicators are taken into account
as specified in 3GPP TS 24.171 [13C].

If the RestrictDCNR bit is set to "Use of dual connectivity with NR is restricted" in the EPS network feature support IE
of the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, the UE shall provide the indication that dual connectivity with
NR is restricted to the upper layers.

The UE supporting N1 mode shall operate in the mode for inter-system interworking with 5GS as follows:

   -   if the IWK N26 bit in the EPS network feature support IE is set to "interworking without N26 interface not
       supported", the UE shall operate in single-registration mode;

   -   if the IWK N26 bit in the EPS network feature support IE is set to "interworking without N26 interface
       supported" and the UE supports dual-registration mode, the UE may operate in dual-registration mode; or

   NOTE:      The registration mode used by the UE is implementation dependent.

   -   if the IWK N26 bit in the EPS network feature support IE is set to "interworking without N26 interface
       supported" and the UE only supports single-registration mode, the UE shall operate in single-registration mode.

The UE shall treat the interworking without N26 interface indicator as valid in the entire PLMN and equivalent PLMNs.
The interworking procedures required for coordination between 5GMM and EMM without N26 interface are specified
in 3GPP TS 24.501 [54].

If the redir-policy bit is set to "Unsecured redirection to GERAN not allowed" in the Network policy IE of the
TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, the UE shall set the network policy on unsecured redirection to
GERAN for the current PLMN to "Unsecured redirection to GERAN not allowed" and indicate to the lower layers that
unsecured redirection to a GERAN cell is not allowed. If the redir-policy bit is set to "Unsecured redirection to GERAN
allowed" or if the Network policy IE is not included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, the UE
shall set the network policy on unsecured redirection to GERAN for the current PLMN to "Unsecured redirection to
GERAN allowed" and indicate to the lower layers that unsecured redirection to a GERAN cell is allowed. The UE shall
set the network policy on unsecured redirection to GERAN to "Unsecured redirection to GERAN not allowed" and
indicate this to the lower layers when any of the following events occurs:

   -   the UE initiates an EPS attach or tracking area updating procedure in a PLMN different from the PLMN where
       the UE performed the last successful EPS attach or tracking area updating procedure;

   -   the UE is switched on; or

   -   the UICC containing the USIM is removed.

If the UE has initiated the tracking area updating procedure due to manual CSG selection and receives a TRACKING
AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, and the UE sent the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message in a CSG
cell, the UE shall check if the CSG ID and associated PLMN identity of the cell where the UE has sent the TRACKING
AREA UPDATE REQUEST message are contained in the Allowed CSG list. If not, the UE shall add that CSG ID and
associated PLMN identity to the Allowed CSG list and the UE may add the HNB Name (if provided by lower layers) to
the Allowed CSG list if the HNB Name is present in neither the Operator CSG list nor the Allowed CSG list.

If the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message contained a GUTI, the UE shall return a TRACKING AREA
UPDATE COMPLETE message to the MME to acknowledge the received GUTI.

If the UE which was previously successfully attached for EPS and non-EPS services receives the TRACKING AREA
UPDATE ACCEPT message with EPS update result IE indicating "combined TA/LA updated" or "combined TA/LA
updated and ISR activated" as the response of the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message with EPS update
type IE indicating "periodic updating", the UE shall behave as follows:

   -   If the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message contains an IMSI, the UE is not allocated any TMSI,
       and shall delete any old TMSI accordingly.

   -   If the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message contains a TMSI, the UE shall use this TMSI as new
       temporary identity. The UE shall delete its old TMSI and shall store the new TMSI. In this case, a TRACKING
       AREA UPDATE COMPLETE message is returned to the network to confirm the received TMSI.

   -   If neither a TMSI nor an IMSI has been included by the network in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT
       message, the old TMSI, if any is available, shall be kept.

If the header compression configuration status is included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, the
UE shall stop using header compression and decompression for those EPS bearers using Control plane CIoT EPS
optimisation for which the MME indicated that the header compression configuration is not used.

If the T3448 value IE is present in the received TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, the UE shall:

   -   stop timer T3448 if it is running; and

   -   start timer T3448 with the value provided in the T3448 value IE.

If the UE is using EPS services with control plane CIoT EPS optimization, the T3448 value IE is present in the
TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message and the value indicates that this timer is either zero or deactivated,
the UE shall consider this case as an abnormal case and proceed as if the T3448 value IE is not present.

   If the UE in EMM-IDLE mode initiated the tracking area update procedure and the TRACKING AREA UPDATE
       ACCEPT message does not include the T3448 value IE and if timer T3448 is running, then the UE shall stop
       timer T3448.

If the UE has indicated "service gap control supported" in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message and:

   -   the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message contains the T3447 value IE, then the UE shall store the
       new T3447 value, erase any previous stored T3447 value if exists and use the the new T3447 value with the
       T3447 timer next time it is started; or

   -   the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message does not contain the T3447 value IE, then the UE shall
       erase any previous stored T3447 value if exists and stop the T3447 timer if running.

Upon receiving a TRACKING AREA UPDATE COMPLETE message, the MME shall stop timer T3450 and change to
state EMM-REGISTERED. The GUTI, if sent in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, shall be
considered as valid.

   NOTE 5: Upon receiving a TRACKING AREA UPDATE COMPLETE message, if a new TMSI was included in
           the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, the MME sends an SGsAP-TMSI-
           REALLOCATION-COMPLETE message as specified in 3GPP TS 29.118 [16A].

For inter-system change from A/Gb mode to S1 mode or Iu mode to S1 mode in EMM-IDLE mode, if the UE has
included an eKSI in the NAS Key Set Identifier IE indicating a current EPS security context in the TRACKING AREA
UPDATE REQUEST message by which the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message is integrity protected,
the MME shall take one of the following actions:

   -   if the MME retrieves the current EPS security context as indicated by the eKSI and GUTI sent by the UE, the
       MME shall integrity check the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message using the current EPS
       security context and integrity protect the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message using the current
       EPS security context;

   -   if the MME cannot retrieve the current EPS security context as indicated by the eKSI and GUTI sent by the UE,
       and if the UE has included a valid GPRS ciphering key sequence number, the MME shall create a new mapped
       EPS security context as specified in 3GPP TS 33.401 [19], and then perform a security mode control procedure
       to indicate the use of the new mapped EPS security context to the UE (see subclause 5.4.3.2); or

   -   if the UE has not included an Additional GUTI IE, the MME may treat the TRACKING AREA UPDATE
       REQUEST message as in the previous item, i.e. as if it cannot retrieve the current EPS security context.

   NOTE 6: The handling described above at failure to retrieve the current EPS security context or if no Additional
           GUTI IE was provided does not preclude the option for the MME to perform an EPS authentication
           procedure and create a new native EPS security context.

For inter-system change from A/Gb mode to S1 mode or Iu mode to S1 mode in EMM-IDLE mode, if the UE has not
included a valid eKSI in the NAS Key Set Identifier IE and has included a valid GPRS ciphering key sequence number
in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, the MME shall create a new mapped EPS security context as
specified in 3GPP TS 33.401 [19], and then perform a security mode control procedure to indicate the use of the new
mapped EPS security context to the UE (see subclause 5.4.3.2).

5.5.3.2.4A           Tracking area updating successful for EPS services and not accepted for SMS
                     services
Apart from the actions on the tracking area updating attempt counter, the description for tracking area update for EPS
services as specified in subclause 5.5.3.2.4 shall be followed. In addition, the following description for tracking area
updating for SMS services applies.

In NB-S1 mode, if the UE requested "SMS only" in the Additional update type IE and supports NB-S1 mode only, the
MME decides to accept the tracking area update request for EPS services only and:

   -   the location update for non-EPS services is not accepted by the VLR as specified in 3GPP TS 29.118 [16A]; or

   -   the MME decides to not accept the tracking area update request for "SMS only",

the MME shall set the EPS update result IE to "EPS only", shall not indicate "SMS only" in the Additional update result
IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message and shall include an appropriate SMS services status value.

The UE receiving the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message takes one of the following actions depending
on the value included in the SMS services status IE:

   "SMS services not available"

          The UE shall stop timer T3430 if still running, shall reset the tracking area updating attempt counter, shall set
          the EPS update status to EU1 UPDATED and shall enter state EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE.
          The USIM shall be considered as invalid for SMS services until switching off or the UICC containing the
          USIM is removed or the timer T3245 expires as described in subclause 5.3.7a.

   "SMS services not available in this PLMN"

          The UE shall stop timer T3430 if still running, shall reset the tracking area updating attempt counter, shall set
          the EPS update status to EU1 UPDATED and shall enter state EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE.

          The UE may provide a notification to the user or the upper layers that the SMS services are not available.

          The UE shall not attempt normal attach or tracking area update procedure indicating "SMS only" with current
          PLMN until switching off the UE or the UICC containing the USIM is removed. Additionally, the UE may
          perform a PLMN selection according to 3GPP TS 23.122 [6].

   "Network failure"

          The UE shall stop timer T3430 if still running. The tracking area updating attempt counter shall be
          incremented, unless it was already set to 5.



                                                          ETSI

           If the tracking area updating attempt counter is less than 5:

           -   the UE shall start timer T3411, shall set the EPS update status to EU1 UPDATED and shall enter state
               EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE. When timer T3411 expires the normal tracking area
               updating procedure for EPS services and "SMS only" or the combined tracking area updating procedure
               for EPS services and "SMS only" is triggered.

           If the tracking area updating attempt counter is equal to 5:

           -   the UE shall start timer T3402, shall set the EPS update status to EU1 UPDATED and shall enter state
               EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE. When timer T3402 expires the normal tracking area
               updating procedure for EPS services and "SMS only" or the combined tracking area updating procedure
               for EPS services and "SMS only" is triggered.

   "Congestion"

           The UE shall stop the timer T3430 if still running. The tracking area updating attempt counter shall be set
           to 5. The UE shall start the timer T3402, shall set the EPS update status to EU1 UPDATED, and shall enter
           state EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE. When timer T3402 expires the normal tracking area
           updating procedure for EPS services and "SMS only" or the combined tracking area updating procedure for
           EPS services and "SMS only" is triggered.

Other values and the case that no SMS services status IE was received are considered as abnormal cases. The tracking
area update procedure shall be considered as failed for SMS services. The behaviour of the UE in those cases is
specified in subclause 5.5.3.2.6A.

5.5.3.2.5             Normal and periodic tracking area updating procedure not accepted by the
                      network
If the tracking area updating cannot be accepted by the network, the MME sends a TRACKING AREA UPDATE
REJECT message to the UE including an appropriate EMM cause value.

If a tracking area update request from a UE with a LIPA PDN connection is not accepted due to the reasons specified in
subclause 5.5.3.2.4, the MME shall send the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REJECT message with EMM cause value
#10 "Implicitly detached".

If the tracking area update request is rejected due to general NAS level mobility management congestion control, the
network shall set the EMM cause value to #22 "congestion" and assign a back-off timer T3346.

If the tracking area request is rejected due to service gap control as specified in subclause 5.3.17 i.e. the T3447 timer is
running, the network shall set the EMM cause value to #22 "congestion" and may assign a back-off timer T3346 with
the remaining time of the running T3447 timer.

If the tracking area update request is rejected due to incompatibility between the CIoT EPS optimizations supported by
the UE and what the network supports and the network sets the EMM cause value to #15 "no suitable cells in tracking
area", the network may additionally include the Extended EMM cause IE with value "requested EPS optimization not
supported".

   NOTE:       How the UE uses the Extended EMM cause IE with value "requested EPS optimization not supported" is
               implementation specific. The UE still behaves according to the EMM cause value #15.

If the UE initiated the tracking area updating procedure due to inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode, and the
MME does not support N26 interface, the MME shall send a TRACKING AREA UPDATE REJECT message with
EMM cause value #9 "UE identity cannot be derived by the network".

Upon receiving the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REJECT message, if the message is integrity protected or contains a
reject cause other than EMM cause value #25, the UE shall stop timer T3430 and stop any transmission of user data.

If the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REJECT message with EMM cause #25 was received without integrity protection,
then the UE shall discard the message.

The UE shall take the following actions depending on the EMM cause value received in the TRACKING AREA
UPDATE REJECT message.

   #6 (Illegal ME); or

   #8 (EPS services and non-EPS services not allowed);

      The UE shall set the EPS update status to EU3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED (and shall store it according to
      subclause 5.1.3.3) and shall delete any GUTI, last visited registered TAI, TAI list and eKSI. The UE shall
      consider the USIM as invalid for EPS services until switching off or the UICC containing the USIM is removed
      or the timer T3245 expires as described in subclause 5.3.7a. The UE shall delete the list of equivalent PLMNs
      and shall enter the state EMM-DEREGISTERED. If the message has been successfully integrity checked by the
      NAS and the UE maintains a counter for "SIM/USIM considered invalid for GPRS services", then the UE shall
      set this counter to UE implementation-specific maximum value.

      If A/Gb mode or Iu mode is supported by the UE, the UE shall handle the GMM parameters GMM state, GPRS
      update status, P-TMSI, P-TMSI signature, RAI and GPRS ciphering key sequence number and the MM
      parameters update status, TMSI, LAI and ciphering key sequence number as specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 [13]
      for the case when the normal routing area updating procedure is rejected with the GMM cause with the same
      value. The USIM shall be considered as invalid also for non-EPS services until switching off or the UICC
      containing the USIM is removed or the timer T3245 expires as described in subclause 5.3.7a. If the message has
      been successfully integrity checked by the NAS and the UE maintains a counter for "SIM/USIM considered
      invalid for non-GPRS services", then the UE shall set this counter to UE implementation-specific maximum
      value.

      If the UE is operating in single-registration mode, the UE shall in addition handle the 5GMM parameters as
      specified in 3GPP TS 24.501 [54] for the case when the registration procedure for mobility and periodic
      registration update indicating "mobility registration updating" in the 5GS registration type IE of the
      REGISTRATION REQUEST message is rejected with the 5GMM cause with the same value.

   NOTE 3: The possibility to configure a UE so that the radio transceiver for a specific radio access technology is not
           active, although it is implemented in the UE, is out of scope of the present specification.

   #7 (EPS services not allowed);

      The UE shall set the EPS update status to EU3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED (and shall store it according to
      subclause 5.1.3.3) and shall delete any GUTI, last visited registered TAI, TAI list and eKSI. The UE shall
      consider the USIM as invalid for EPS services until switching off or the UICC containing the USIM is removed
      or the timer T3245 expires as described in subclause 5.3.7a. The UE shall delete the list of equivalent PLMNs
      and shall enter the state EMM-DEREGISTERED. If the message has been successfully integrity checked by the
      NAS and the UE maintains a counter for "SIM/USIM considered invalid for GPRS services", then the UE shall
      set this counter to UE implementation-specific maximum value.

      If the EPS update type is "periodic updating", a UE operating in CS/PS mode 1 or CS/PS mode 2 of operation,
      which is IMSI attached for non-EPS services, is still IMSI attached for non-EPS services. The UE operating in
      CS/PS mode 1 or CS/PS mode 2 of operation shall set the update status to U2 NOT UPDATED, shall attempt to
      select GERAN or UTRAN radio access technology and shall proceed with appropriate MM specific procedure
      according to the MM service state. The UE shall not reselect E-UTRAN radio access technology until switching
      off or the UICC containing the USIM is removed.

      If A/Gb mode or Iu mode is supported by the UE, the UE shall handle the GMM parameters GMM state, GPRS
      update status, P-TMSI, P-TMSI signature, RAI and GPRS ciphering key sequence number as specified in
      3GPP TS 24.008 [13] for the case when the normal routing area updating procedure is rejected with the GMM
      cause with the same value.

      If the UE is operating in single-registration mode, the UE shall in addition handle the 5GMM parameters as
      specified in 3GPP TS 24.501 [54] for the case when the registration procedure for mobility and periodic
      registration update indicating "mobility registration updating" in the 5GS registration type IE of the
      REGISTRATION REQUEST message is rejected with the 5GMM cause with the same value.

   #9 (UE identity cannot be derived by the network);

      The UE shall set the EPS update status to EU2 NOT UPDATED (and shall store it according to
      subclause 5.1.3.3) and shall delete any GUTI, last visited registered TAI, TAI list and eKSI. The UE shall enter
      the state EMM-DEREGISTERED.

   #10   (Implicitly detached);

      If the EPS update type is "periodic updating", a UE in CS/PS mode 1 or CS/PS mode 2 of operation is IMSI
      detached for both EPS services and non-EPS services.

      The UE shall enter the state EMM-DEREGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE. The UE shall delete any mapped
      EPS security context or partial native EPS security context. If the rejected request was not for initiating a PDN
      connection for emergency bearer services, the UE shall then perform a new attach procedure.

   NOTE 5: User interaction is necessary in some cases when the UE cannot re-activate the EPS bearer(s)
           automatically.

      If A/Gb mode or Iu mode is supported by the UE, the UE shall handle the GMM state as specified in

      If A/Gb mode or Iu mode is supported by the UE, the UE shall handle the GMM parameters GMM state, GPRS
      update status, P-TMSI, P-TMSI signature, RAI, GPRS ciphering key sequence number and routing area updating
      attempt counter as specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 [13] for the case when the normal routing area updating
      procedure is rejected with the GMM cause with the same value.

   #15    (No suitable cells in tracking area);

      The UE shall set the EPS update status to EU3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED (and shall store it according to
      subclause 5.1.3.3). The UE shall reset the tracking area updating attempt counter and shall enter the state EMM-
      REGISTERED.LIMITED-SERVICE.

      The UE shall store the current TAI in the list of "forbidden tracking areas for roaming" and shall remove the
      current TAI from the stored TAI list if present and:

      -   if the UE is in WB-S1 mode and the Extended EMM cause IE with value "E-UTRAN not allowed" is
          included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REJECT message, the UE supports "E-UTRA Disabling for
          EMM cause #15", and the "E-UTRA Disabling Allowed for EMM cause #15" parameter as specified in
          3GPP TS 24.368 [15A] or 3GPP TS 31.102 [17] is present and set to enabled; then the UE shall disable the
          E-UTRA capability as specified in subclause 4.5 and search for a suitable cell in another location area or 5GS
          tracking area;

      -   if the UE is in NB-S1 mode and the Extended EMM cause IE with value "NB-IoT not allowed" is included in
          the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REJECT message, then the UE may disable the NB-IoT capability as
          specified in subclause 4.9 and search for a suitable cell in E-UTRAN radio access technology;

      -   otherwise, the UE shall search for a suitable cell in another tracking area or in another location area
          according to 3GPP TS 36.304 [21].

      If A/Gb mode or Iu mode is supported by the UE, the UE shall handle the GMM parameters GMM state, GPRS
      update status and routing area updating attempt counter as specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 [13] for the case when
      the normal routing area updating procedure is rejected with the GMM cause with the same value.

      If the UE is operating in single-registration mode, the UE shall in addition handle the 5GMM parameters except
      the current TAI as specified in 3GPP TS 24.501 [54] for the case when the registration procedure for mobility
      and periodic registration update indicating "mobility registration updating" in the 5GS registration type IE of the
      REGISTRATION REQUEST message is rejected with the 5GMM cause with the same value.

   #22    (Congestion);

      If the T3346 value IE is present in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REJECT message and the value indicates
      that this timer is neither zero nor deactivated, the UE shall proceed as described below, otherwise it shall be
      considered as an abnormal case and the behaviour of the UE for this case is specified in subclause 5.5.3.2.6.

      The UE shall abort the tracking area updating procedure, reset the tracking area updating attempt counter and set
      the EPS update status to EU2 NOT UPDATED. If the rejected request was not for initiating a PDN connection
      for emergency bearer services, the UE shall change to state EMM-REGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-
      UPDATE.

      The UE shall stop timer T3346 if it is running.

      If the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REJECT message is integrity protected, the UE shall start timer with the
      value provided in the T3346 value IE.

       If the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REJECT message is not integrity protected, the UE shall start timer T3346
       with a random value from the default range specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 [13].

       The UE stays in the current serving cell and applies the normal cell reselection process. The tracking area
       updating procedure is started, if still necessary, when timer T3346 expires or is stopped.

       If A/Gb mode or Iu mode is supported by the UE, the UE shall handle the GMM parameters GMM state, GPRS
       update status and routing area updating attempt counter as specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 [13] for the case when
       the normal routing area updating procedure is rejected with the GMM cause with the same value.

       If the UE is operating in single-registration mode, the UE shall in addition handle the 5GMM parameters as
       specified in 3GPP TS 24.501 [54] for the case when the registration procedure for mobility and periodic
       registration update indicating "mobility registration updating" in the 5GS registration type IE of the
       REGISTRATION REQUEST message is rejected with the 5GMM cause with the same value.

   #25    (Not authorized for this CSG);

       EMM cause #25 is only applicable when received from a CSG cell. EMM cause #25 received from a non-CSG
       cell is considered as an abnormal case and the behaviour of the UE is specified in subclause 5.5.3.2.6.

       The UE shall set the EPS update status to EU3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED (and store it according to
       subclause 5.1.3.3). The UE shall reset the tracking area updating attempt counter and shall enter the state EMM-
       REGISTERED.LIMITED-SERVICE.

       If the CSG ID and associated PLMN identity of the cell where the UE has sent the TRACKING AREA
       UPDATE REQUEST message are contained in the Allowed CSG list, the UE shall remove the entry
       corresponding to this CSG ID and associated PLMN identity from the Allowed CSG list.

       If the CSG ID and associated PLMN identity of the cell where the UE has sent the TRACKING AREA
       UPDATE REQUEST message are contained in the Operator CSG list, the UE shall apply the procedures defined
       in 3GPP TS 23.122 [6] subclause 3.1A.

       The UE shall search for a suitable cell according to 3GPP TS 36.304 [21].

       update status and routing area updating attempt counter as specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 [13] for the case when
       the normal routing area updating procedure is rejected with the GMM cause with the same value.

   #40    (No EPS bearer context activated);

       The UE shall deactivate all the EPS bearer contexts locally, if any, and shall enter the state EMM-
       DEREGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE. The UE shall perform a new attach procedure.

   NOTE 6: User interaction is necessary in some cases when the UE cannot re-activate the EPS bearer(s)
           automatically.

       If A/Gb mode or Iu mode is supported by the UE, the UE shall handle the GMM state as specified in
       3GPP TS 24.008 [13] for the case when the normal routing area updating procedure is rejected with the GMM
       cause value #10 "Implicitly detached".

   #42    (Severe network failure);

       The UE shall set the EPS update status to EU2 NOT UPDATED, and shall delete any GUTI, last visited
       registered TAI, eKSI, and list of equivalent PLMNs, and set the tracking area update counter to 5. The UE shall
       start an implementation specific timer, setting its value to 2 times the value of T as defined in
       3GPP TS 23.122 [6]. While this timer is running, the UE shall not consider the PLMN + RAT combination that
       provided this reject cause as a candidate for PLMN selection. The UE then enters state EMM-
       DEREGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH in order to perform a PLMN selection according to 3GPP TS 23.122 [6].

       If A/Gb mode or Iu mode is supported by the UE, the UE shall in addition set the GMM state to GMM-

5.5.3.2.5A           Tracking area updating procedure for initiating a PDN connection for emergency
                     bearer services not accepted by the network
If the tracking area updating request for initiating a PDN connection for emergency bearer services cannot be accepted
by the network, the UE shall perform the procedures as described in subclause 5.5.3.2.5. Then if the UE is in the same
selected PLMN where the last tracking area updating request was attempted, the UE shall:

   a) inform the upper layers of the failure of the procedure; or

   NOTE 1: This can result in the upper layers establishment of a CS emergency call (if not already attempted in the
           CS domain) or other implementation specific mechanisms, e.g. procedures specified in
           3GPP TS 24.229 [13D] can result in the emergency call being attempted to another IP-CAN.

   b) detach locally, if not detached already, attempt EPS attach for emergency bearer services.

If the tracking area updating request for initiating a PDN connection for emergency bearer services fails due to
abnormal case a) in subclause 5.5.3.2.6, the UE shall perform the actions as described in subclause 5.5.3.2.6 and inform
the upper layers of the failure to access the network.

   NOTE 2: This can result in the upper layers establishment of a CS emergency call (if not already attempted in the
           CS domain) or other implementation specific mechanisms, e.g. procedures specified in
           3GPP TS 24.229 [13D] can result in the emergency call being attempted to another IP-CAN.

If the tracking area updating request for initiating a PDN connection for emergency bearer services fails due to
abnormal cases b), c) or d) in subclause 5.5.3.2.6, the UE shall perform the procedures as described in
subclause 5.5.3.2.6. Then if the UE is in the same selected PLMN where the last tracking area updating request was
attempted, the UE shall:

   a) inform the upper layers of the failure of the procedure; or

   NOTE 3: This can result in the upper layers establishment of a CS emergency call (if not already attempted in the

   b) detach locally, if not detached already, attempt EPS attach for emergency bearer services.

5.5.3.2.6            Abnormal cases in the UE
The following abnormal cases can be identified:

   a) Access barred because of access class barring, EAB, ACDC or NAS signalling connection establishment
      rejected by the network without "Extended wait time" received from lower layers

       In WB-S1 mode, if the tracking area updating procedure is started in response to a paging request from the
       network, access class barring, EAB or ACDC is not applicable.

       In NB-S1 mode, if the tracking area updating procedure is started in response to a paging request from the
       network, access barring is not applicable.

       In WB-S1 mode, if access is barred for "originating signalling" (see 3GPP TS 36.331 [22]), the tracking area
       updating procedure shall not be started. The UE stays in the current serving cell and applies the normal cell
       reselection process. The tracking area updating procedure is started as soon as possible and if still necessary, e.g.
       when access for "originating signalling" is granted on the current cell or when the UE moves to a cell where
       access for "originating signalling" is granted.

       In NB-S1 mode, if access is barred for "originating signalling" (see 3GPP TS 36.331 [22]), the tracking area
       updating procedure shall not be started. The UE stays in the current serving cell and applies the normal cell
       reselection process. Further UE behaviour is implementation specific, e.g. the tracking area updating procedure
       is started again after an implementation dependent time.

       In NB-S1 mode, if access is barred for "originating signalling" (see 3GPP TS 36.331 [22]), a request for an
       exceptional event is received from the upper layers, then the tracking area updating procedure shall be started.

   NOTE 1: In NB-S1 mode, the EMM layer cannot receive the access barring alleviation indication from the lower
           layers (see 3GPP TS 36.331 [22]).

3GPP TS 24.301 version 15.8.0 Release 15                  171                       ETSI TS 124 301 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


      If access is barred because of access class barring for "originating signalling" (see 3GPP TS 36.331 [22]) and if:

      -   one of the MO MMTEL voice call is started, MO MMTEL video call is started or MO SMSoIP is started
          conditions is satisfied;

      -   the upper layers request to send a mobile originated SMS over NAS or SMS over S102; or

      -   the upper layers request user plane radio resources, ACDC is applicable to the request and the UE supports
          ACDC.

      then the tracking area updating procedure shall be started according to subclause 5.5.3.2.2. The call type used
      shall be per annex D of this document.

   NOTE 2: If more than one of MO MMTEL voice call is started, MO MMTEL video call is started or MO SMSoIP
           is started conditions are satisfied, it is left to UE implementation to determine the call type based on
           Annex D of this document.

      If access is barred for a certain ACDC category (see 3GPP TS 36.331 [22]), and if the upper layers request user
      plane radio resources for a higher ACDC category and the UE supports ACDC, then the tracking area updating
      procedure shall be started according to subclause 5.5.3.2.2.

      If an access request for an uncategorized application is barred due to ACDC (see 3GPP TS 36.331 [22]), and if
      the upper layers request user plane radio resources for a certain ACDC category and the UE supports ACDC,
      then the tracking area updating procedure shall be started according to subclause 5.5.3.2.2.

      If the trigger for the tracking area update procedure is the response to a paging request from the network and the
      NAS signalling connection establishment is rejected by the network, the tracking area update procedure shall not
      be started. The UE stays in the current serving cell and applies normal cell reselection process. The tracking area
      update procedure may be started if it is still necessary when access for "terminating calls" is granted or because
      of a cell change.

   b) Lower layer failure or release of the NAS signalling connection without "Extended wait time" and without
      "Extended wait time CP data" received from lower layers before the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT or
      TRACKING AREA UPDATE REJECT message is received

      The tracking area updating procedure shall be aborted, and the UE shall proceed as described below.

   c) T3430 timeout

      The UE shall abort the procedure and proceed as described below. The NAS signalling connection, if any, shall
      be released locally.

   NOTE 3: The NAS signalling connection can also be released if the UE deems that the network has failed the
           authentication check as specified in subclause 5.4.2.7.

   d) TRACKING AREA UPDATE REJECT, other causes than those treated in subclause 5.5.3.2.5, and cases of
      EMM cause values #22 and #25, if considered as abnormal cases according to subclause 5.5.3.2.5

      If the tracking area updating request is not for initiating a PDN connection for emergency bearer services, upon
      reception of the EMM causes #95, #96, #97, #99 and #111 the UE should set the tracking area updating attempt
      counter to 5.

      The UE shall proceed as described below.

   e) Change of cell into a new tracking area

      If a cell change into a new tracking area occurs before the tracking area updating procedure is completed, the
      tracking area updating procedure shall be aborted and re-initiated immediately. The UE shall set the EPS update
      status to EU2 NOT UPDATED.

      The UE shall proceed as described below.

   f) Tracking area updating and detach procedure collision

      EPS detach containing detach type "re-attach required" or "re-attach not required":

         If the UE receives a DETACH REQUEST message before the tracking area updating procedure has been
         completed, the tracking area updating procedure shall be aborted and the detach procedure shall be
         progressed. If the DETACH REQUEST message contains detach type "re-attach not required" and EMM
         cause #2 "IMSI unknown in HSS", the UE will follow the procedure as described below for the detach type
         "IMSI detach".

      EPS detach containing detach type "IMSI detach":

         If the UE receives a DETACH REQUEST message before the tracking area updating procedure has been
         completed, the DETACH REQUEST message shall be ignored and tracking area updating procedure shall be
         progressed.

      The UE shall proceed as described below.

   g) Tracking area updating and GUTI reallocation procedure collision

      If the UE receives a GUTI REALLOCATION COMMAND message before the tracking area updating
      procedure has been completed, this message shall be ignored and the tracking area updating procedure shall be
      progressed.

   h) Transmission failure of TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message indication from lower layers

      The tracking area updating procedure shall be aborted and re-initiated immediately. The UE shall set the EPS
      update status to EU2 NOT UPDATED.

   i) Transmission failure of TRACKING AREA UPDATE COMPLETE message indication with TAI change from
      lower layers

      If the current TAI is not in the TAI list, the tracking area updating procedure shall be aborted and re-initiated
      immediately. The UE shall set the EPS update status to EU2 NOT UPDATED.

      If the current TAI is still part of the TAI list, it is up to the UE implementation how to re-run the ongoing
      procedure.

   j) Transmission failure of TRACKING AREA UPDATE COMPLETE message indication without TAI change
      from lower layers

      It is up to the UE implementation how to re-run the ongoing procedure.

   k) "Extended wait time" from the lower layers

      If the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message contained the low priority indicator set to "MS is
      configured for NAS signalling low priority", the UE shall start timer T3346 with the "Extended wait time" value
      and reset the tracking area updating attempt counter.

      If the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message did not contain the low priority indicator set to "MS is
      configured for NAS signalling low priority", the UE is operating in NB-S1 mode and the UE is not a UE
      configured to use AC11 – 15 in selected PLMN, then the UE shall start timer T3346 with the "Extended wait
      time" value and reset the tracking area updating attempt counter.

      In other cases the UE shall ignore the "Extended wait time".

      The UE shall abort the tracking area updating procedure, stay in the current serving cell, set the EPS update
      status to EU2 NOT UPDATED, change the state to EMM-REGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-UPDATE and
      apply the normal cell reselection process.

      If the UE had used eDRX before initiating tracking area updating procedure, then the UE shall continue to use
      the eDRX with the extended DRX parameters IE received during the last attach or tracking area updating
      procedure.

      The UE shall proceed as described below.

   ka) "Extended wait time CP data" from the lower layers

      If the UE is operating in NB-S1 mode and supports the timer T3448, the UE shall start the timer T3448 with the
      "Extended wait time CP data" value. If the UE is operating in NB-S1 mode and does not support the timer



                                                          ETSI

      T3448, the UE shall start the timer T3346 with the "Extended wait time CP data" value and reset the tracking
      area updating attempt counter.

      In other cases the UE shall ignore the "Extended wait time CP data".

      The UE shall abort the tracking area updating procedure, stay in the current serving cell, set the EPS update
      status to EU2 NOT UPDATED, change the state to EMM-REGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-UPDATE and
      apply the normal cell reselection process.

      If the UE had used eDRX before initiating tracking area updating procedure, then the UE shall continue to use
      the eDRX with the extended DRX parameters IE received during the last attach or tracking area updating
      procedure.

      The UE shall proceed as described below.

   l) Timer T3346 is running

      The UE shall not start the tracking area updating procedure unless:

      -   the UE is in EMM-CONNECTED mode;

      -   the UE received a paging;

      -   the UE is a UE configured to use AC11 – 15 in selected PLMN;

      -   the UE has a PDN connection for emergency bearer services established or is establishing a PDN connection
          for emergency bearer services;

      -   the UE is requested by the upper layer for a CS fallback for emergency call or a 1xCS fallback for emergency
          call;

      -   the UE in NB-S1 mode is requested by the upper layer to transmit user data related to an exceptional event
          and

          i) the UE is allowed to use exception data reporting (see the ExceptionDataReportingAllowed leaf of the
             NAS configuration MO in 3GPP TS 24.368 [15A] or the USIM file EFNASCONFIG in
             3GPP TS 31.102 [17]); and

          ii) timer T3346 was not started when NAS signaling connection was established with RRC establishment
              cause set to "MO exception data"; or

      -   the UE has a PDN connection established without the NAS signalling low priority indication or is
          establishing a PDN connection without the NAS signalling low priority indication, the timer T3402 and the
          timer T3411 are not running and the timer T3346 was started due to rejection of a NAS request message (e.g.
          ATTACH REQUEST, TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST or EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST)
          which contained the low priority indicator set to "MS is configured for NAS signalling low priority".

      The UE stays in the current serving cell and applies the normal cell reselection process.

   NOTE 4: It is considered an abnormal case if the UE needs to initiate a tracking area updating procedure while
           timer T3346 is running independent on whether timer T3346 was started due to an abnormal case or a non
           successful case.

      If the TAI of the current serving cell is not included in the TAI list or the TIN indicates "P-TMSI", the UE shall
      set the EPS update status to EU2 NOT UPDATED and change to state EMM-REGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-
      TO-UPDATE.

      The UE shall proceed as described below.

   la) Timer T3448 is running

      The UE shall not start the tracking area updating procedure with the "signalling active" flag unless:

       Detach due to removal of USIM or due to switch off:

           The tracking area updating procedure shall be aborted, and the UE initiated detach procedure shall be
           performed.

       Detach not due to removal of USIM and not due to switch off:

           The UE initiated detach procedure shall be initiated after successful completion of the tracking area updating
           procedure.

   o) Timer T3447 is running

       The UE shall not start the tracking area updating procedure with the "signalling active" or "active" flag unless:

       -   the UE received a paging;

       -   the UE is a UE configured to use AC11 – 15 in selected PLMN;

       -   the UE has a PDN connection for emergency bearer services established or is establishing a PDN connection
           for emergency bearer services;

       The UE stays in the current serving cell and applies the normal cell reselection process. The tracking area update
       request procedure is started, if still necessary, when timer T3447 expires.

   p) Tracking area updating and paging procedure collision

       If the UE receives a CS SERVICE NOTIFICATION message before the tracking area updating procedure has
       been completed, the UE shall progress the tracking area updating procedure and respond to the CS SERVICE
       NOTIFICATION upon successful completion of the tracking area updating procedure.

For the cases b, c, d, e, f with detach type "re-attach required" or "re-attach not required" with EMM cause other than #2
"IMSI unknown in HSS", k and ka, the UE shall stop any ongoing transmission of user data.

For the cases b, c, d, k, ka, l and la, the UE shall proceed as follows:

       Timer T3430 shall be stopped if still running.

       For the cases b, c, d, la k when the "Extended wait time" is ignored, and ka when the "Extended wait time CP
       data" is ignored, if the tracking area updating request is not for initiating a PDN connection for emergency bearer
       services, the tracking area updating attempt counter shall be incremented, unless it was already set to 5.

       If the tracking area updating attempt counter is less than 5, and the TAI of the current serving cell is included in
       the TAI list, and the EPS update status is equal to EU1 UPDATED and the TIN does not indicate "P-TMSI":

           the UE shall keep the EPS update status to EU1 UPDATED and enter state EMM-
           REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE. The UE shall start timer T3411.

           If in addition the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST indicated "periodic updating" or if tracking area
           updating procedure was initiated to recover NAS signalling connection due to "RRC Connection failure"
           from the lower layers, none of the other reasons for initiating the tracking area updating procedure listed in
           subclause 5.5.3.2.2 was applicable, and the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message did not
           include T3324 value IE, T3412 extended value IE or Extended DRX parameters IE, the timer T3411 may be
           stopped when the UE enters EMM-CONNECTED mode.

           If timer T3411 expires the tracking area updating procedure is triggered again.

      If the tracking area updating attempt counter is less than 5, and the TAI of the current serving cell is not included
      in the TAI list or the EPS update status is different to EU1 UPDATED or the TIN indicates "P-TMSI" or the
      tracking area updating procedure is performed due to an inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode:

      -   for the cases k and l, the tracking area updating procedure is started, if still necessary, when timer T3346
          expires or is stopped.

      -   for the case ka, if timer T3346 is started, the tracking area updating procedure is started, if still necessary,
          when timer T3346 expires or is stopped.

      -   for the case ka, if timer T3448 is started and the "signalling active" flag is set in the TRACKING AREA
          UPDATE REQUEST message, the tracking area updating procedure is started, if still necessary, when timer
          T3448 expires or is stopped.

      -   for the case la, if the "signalling active" flag is set in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message,
          the tracking area updating procedure is started, if still necessary, when timer T3448 expires or is stopped.

      -   for the cases b, c, d, k when the "Extended wait time" is ignored, and ka when the "Extended wait time CP
          data" is ignored, if the tracking area updating request is not for initiating a PDN connection for emergency
          bearer services, the UE shall start timer T3411, shall set the EPS update status to EU2 NOT UPDATED and
          change to state EMM-REGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-UPDATE. When timer T3411 expires the tracking
          area updating procedure is triggered again.

          If A/Gb mode or Iu mode is supported by the UE, the UE shall in addition handle the GPRS update status as
          specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 [13] for the abnormal case when a normal or periodic routing area updating
          procedure fails and the routing area updating attempt counter is less than 5 and the GPRS update status is
          different from GU1 UPDATED.

          If the UE is operating in single registration mode, the UE shall in addition handle the 5GS update status as
          specified in 3GPP TS 24.501 [54] for the abnormal cases when a registration procedure for mobility and
          periodic registration fails and the registration attempt counter is less than 5 and the 5GS update status is
          different from 5U1 UPDATED.

      If the tracking area updating attempt counter is equal to 5:

      -   the UE shall start timer T3402, shall set the EPS update status to EU2 NOT UPDATED;

      -   the UE shall delete the list of equivalent PLMNs and shall change to state EMM-
          REGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-UPDATE or optionally to EMM-REGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH in
          order to perform a PLMN selection according to 3GPP TS 23.122 [6]; and

      -   if A/Gb mode, Iu mode or N1 mode is supported by the UE:

          -   if A/Gb mode or Iu mode is supported by the UE, the UE shall in addition handle the GPRS update status
              as specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 [13] for the abnormal case when a normal or periodic routing area
              updating procedure fails and the routing area updating attempt counter is equal to 5;

          -   if the UE is operating in single-registration mode, the UE shall in addition handle the 5GMM parameters
              as specified in 3GPP TS 24.501 [54] for the abnormal case when a registration procedure for mobility or
              periodic registration update fails and the registration attempt counter is equal to 5; and

          -   if the UE does not change to state EMM-REGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH, the UE shall attempt to select
              GERAN. UTRAN or NG-RAN radio access technology.

              If a GERAN or UTRAN cell is selected:

              -   a UE in PS mode 1 or PS mode 2 of operation shall proceed with appropriate GMM specific
                  procedures;

              -   a UE in CS/PS mode 1 or CS/PS mode 2 of operation shall proceed with appropriate MM or GMM
                  specific procedures.

              If an NG-RAN cell is selected, the UE shall proceed with appropriate 5GMM specific procedures.

              Additionally, the UE may disable the E-UTRA capability as specified in subclause 4.5.

5.5.3.2.6A             Abnormal cases in the UE, SMS services not accepted
The UE shall proceed as follows:

   1) if the tracking area update was successful for EPS services only and the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT
      message contained a value included in the SMS services status IE not treated in subclause 5.5.3.2.4A or the SMS
      services status IE is not included in the message, the UE shall proceed as follows:

      a) The UE shall stop timer T3430 if still running. The tracking area updating attempt counter shall be
         incremented, unless it was already set to 5;

      b) If the tracking area updating attempt counter is less than 5:

          -   the UE shall start timer T3411, shall set the EPS update status to EU1 UPDATED and shall enter state
              EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE. When timer T3411 expires the normal tracking area
              updating procedure for EPS services and "SMS only" or the combined tracking area updating procedure
              for EPS services and "SMS only" is triggered;

      c) If the tracking area updating attempt counter is equal to 5:

          -   the UE shall start timer T3402, shall set the EPS update status to EU1 UPDATED and shall enter state
              EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE. When timer T3402 expires the normal tracking area
              updating procedure for EPS services and "SMS only" or the combined tracking area updating procedure
              for EPS services and "SMS only" is triggered; and

   2) otherwise, the abnormal cases specified in subclause 5.5.3.2.6 apply.

5.5.3.2.7              Abnormal cases on the network side
The following abnormal cases can be identified:

   a) If a lower layer failure occurs before the message TRACKING AREA UPDATE COMPLETE has been received
      from the UE and a GUTI has been assigned, the network shall abort the procedure, enter EMM-IDLE mode and
      shall consider both, the old and new GUTI as valid until the old GUTI can be considered as invalid by the
      network (see subclause 5.4.1.4). During this period the network may use the identification procedure followed by
      a GUTI reallocation procedure if the old GUTI is used by the UE in a subsequent message.

      The network may page with IMSI if paging with old and new S-TMSI fails. Paging with IMSI causes the UE to
      re-attach as described in subclause 5.6.2.2.2.

   b) Protocol error

      If the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message has been received with a protocol error, the network
      shall return a TRACKING AREA UPDATE REJECT message with one of the following EMM cause values:

      #96:    invalid mandatory information element error;

      #99:    information element non-existent or not implemented;

      #100: conditional IE error; or

      #111: protocol error, unspecified.

   c) T3450 time-out

      On the first expiry of the timer, the network shall retransmit the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT
      message and shall reset and restart timer T3450. The retransmission is performed four times, i.e. on the fifth
      expiry of timer T3450, the tracking area updating procedure is aborted. Both, the old and the new GUTI shall be
      considered as valid until the old GUTI can be considered as invalid by the network (see subclause 5.4.1.4).
      During this period the network acts as described for case a above.

   d) TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST received after the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message
      has been sent and before the TRACKING AREA UPDATE COMPLETE message is received

      -   If one or more of the information elements in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message differ
          from the ones received within the previous TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, the



                                                          ETSI

          previously initiated tracking area updating procedure shall be aborted if the TRACKING AREA UPDATE
          COMPLETE message has not been received and the new tracking area updating procedure shall be
          progressed; or

      -   if the information elements do not differ, then the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message shall be
          resent and the timer T3450 shall be restarted if an TRACKING AREA UPDATE COMPLETE message is
          expected. In that case, the retransmission counter related to T3450 is not incremented.

   e) More than one TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST received and no TRACKING AREA UPDATE
      ACCEPT or TRACKING AREA UPDATE REJECT message has been sent

      -   If one or more of the information elements in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message differs
          from the ones received within the previous TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, the
          previously initiated tracking area updating procedure shall be aborted and the new tracking area updating
          procedure shall be progressed;

      -   if the information elements do not differ, then the network shall continue with the previous tracking area
          updating procedure and shall not treat any further this TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message.

   f) Lower layers indication of non-delivered NAS PDU due to handover

          If the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message or TRACKING AREA UPDATE REJECT message
          could not be delivered due to an intra MME handover and the TAI of the target cell and the TAI of the source
          cell are the same, then upon successful completion of the intra MME handover the MME shall retransmit the
          TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message or TRACKING AREA UPDATE REJECT message. If a
          failure of the handover procedure is reported by the lower layer and the S1 signalling connection exists, the
          MME shall retransmit the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message or TRACKING AREA
          UPDATE REJECT message.

   g) DETACH REQUEST message received before the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message is sent or
      before the TRACKING AREA UPDATE COMPLETE message (in case of GUTI and/or TMSI was allocated) is
      received.

      Detach containing cause "switch off":

          The network shall abort the signalling for the tracking area updating procedure towards the UE and shall
          progress the detach procedure as described in subclause 5.5.2.2.

   NOTE:     Internally in the network, before processing the detach request, the MME can perform the necessary
             signalling procedures for the tracking area updating procedure before progressing the detach procedure.

      Detach containing other causes than "switch off":

          The network shall proceed with the tracking area updating procedure and shall progress the detach procedure
          after successful completion of the tracking area updating procedure.

   h) If the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message with EPS update type IE indicating "periodic
      updating" is received by the new MME which does not have the EMM context data related to the subscription,
      the new MME may send the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REJECT message with EMM cause value #10
      "Implicitly detached"

5.5.3.3          Combined tracking area updating procedure

5.5.3.3.1           General
Within a combined tracking area updating procedure the messages TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT and
TRACKING AREA UPDATE COMPLETE carry information for the tracking area updating and the location area
updating.

The combined tracking area updating procedure follows the normal tracking area updating procedure described in
subclause 5.5.3.2 with exception of subclause 5.5.3.2.4A and subclause 5.5.3.2.6A.

   e) when the UE enters EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE and the UE's TIN indicates "P-TMSI";

   f) when the UE receives an indication from the lower layers that the RRC connection was released with cause "load
      balancing TAU required";

   g) when the UE deactivated EPS bearer context(s) locally while in EMM-REGISTERED, because it was not able or
      not allowed to establish a NAS signalling connection, and then returns to EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-
      SERVICE and no EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST message, CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST
      message or DETACH REQUEST message is pending to be sent by the UE;

   h) when the UE changes the UE network capability information or the MS network capability information or both;

   i) when the UE changes the UE specific DRX parameter;

   j) when the UE receives an indication of "RRC Connection failure" from the lower layers and has no signalling or
      user uplink data pending (i.e when the lower layer requests NAS signalling connection recovery);

   k) when due to manual CSG selection the UE has selected a CSG cell whose CSG identity and associated PLMN
      identity are not included in the UE's Allowed CSG list or in the UE's Operator CSG list;

   l) when the UE reselects an E-UTRAN cell while it was in GPRS READY state or PMM-CONNECTED mode;

   m) when the UE supports SRVCC to GERAN or UTRAN or supports vSRVCC to UTRAN, and changes the mobile

the following different cases can be distinguished:

   1) The EPS update result IE value indicates "combined TA/LA updated": Tracking and location area updating is
      successful for EPS and non-EPS services, or for EPS services and "SMS only";

   2) The EPS update result IE value indicates "TA updated": Tracking area updating is successful, but location area
      updating for non-EPS services or "SMS only" is not successful.

A TRACKING AREA UPDATE COMPLETE message shall be returned to the network if the TRACKING AREA
UPDATE ACCEPT message contains a GUTI or a TMSI or both.

5.5.3.3.4.2              Combined tracking area updating successful

The description for normal tracking area update as specified in subclause 5.5.3.2.4 shall be followed. In addition, the
following description for location area updating applies.

The TMSI reallocation may be part of the combined tracking area updating procedure. The TMSI allocated is then
included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message together with the location area identification (LAI). In
this case the MME shall change to state EMM-COMMON-PROCEDURE-INITIATED and shall start the timer T3450
as described in subclause 5.4.1. The LAI may be included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message
without TMSI. If the MME does not indicate "SMS only" in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message,
subject to operator policies the MME should allocate a TAI list that does not span more than one location area.

For a shared network in CS domain, the MME indicates the selected PLMN for CS domain in the LAI to the UE as
specified in 3GPP TS 23.272 [9].

The UE, receiving a TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, stores the received location area identification,
resets the location update attempt counter, sets the update status to U1 UPDATED and enters MM state MM IDLE.

If the UE maintains a counter for "SIM/USIM considered invalid for non-GPRS services" events (see subclause 5.3.7b),
then the UE shall reset this counter.

If the LAI contained in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message is a member of the list of "forbidden
location areas for regional provision of service" or the list of "forbidden location areas for roaming" then such entry
shall be deleted.

If the PLMN identity for the CS domain which is provided as part of the LAI contained in the TRACKING AREA
UPDATE ACCEPT message differs from the PLMN identity provided as part of the GUTI, the MME shall include the
PLMN identity for the CS domain in the list of equivalent PLMNs in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT
message.

If the UE requested "SMS only" in the Additional update type IE, or if the UE requested a combined tracking area
updating for EPS and non-EPS services, but the network decides to accept the tracking area update request for EPS
services and "SMS only", the network shall indicate "SMS only" in the Additional update result IE. In addition, if the
SMS services are provided via SMS in MME, the network shall, in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT
message, provide a non-broadcast LAI and may indicate in the EPS update result IE that ISR is activated. If a TMSI has
to be allocated, then the network shall also provide a TMSI which cannot cause any ambiguity with assigned TMSI
values.

If the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message includes the Additional update result IE with value "SMS
only", a UE operating in CS/PS mode 2 and a UE operating in CS/PS mode 1 with "IMS voice available" shall not
attempt to use CS fallback for mobile originating services.

3GPP TS 24.301 version 15.8.0 Release 15                   181                       ETSI TS 124 301 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


As an implementation option, if the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message does not include the Additional
update result IE with value "SMS only" and the UE is not configured for NAS signaling low priority then the UE may
stop timer T3246 if running.

If the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message includes the Additional update result IE with value "CS
Fallback not preferred", this indicates to a UE operating in CS/PS mode 2 and a UE operating in CS/PS mode 1 with
"IMS voice available" that it is attached for EPS and non-EPS services and that it can use CS fallback.

How to handle the old TMSI stored in the UE depends on the mobile identity included in the TRACKING AREA
UPDATE ACCEPT message.

   -   If the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message contains an IMSI, the UE is not allocated any TMSI,
       and shall delete any old TMSI accordingly.

   -   If the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message contains a TMSI, the UE shall use this TMSI as new
       temporary identity. The UE shall delete its old TMSI and shall store the new TMSI. In this case, a TRACKING
       AREA UPDATE COMPLETE message is returned to the network to confirm the received TMSI.

   -   If neither a TMSI nor an IMSI has been included by the network in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT
       message, the old TMSI, if any is available, shall be kept.

   NOTE 1: It is possible for UEs compliant with earlier versions of this specification to send a TRACKING AREA
           UPDATE COMPLETE message even if TMSI reallocation is not part of the combined tracking area
           update procedure.

If the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message includes the Additional update result IE with value "SMS only"
or "CS Fallback not preferred", a UE operating in CS/PS mode 1 with "IMS voice not available" shall attempt to select
GERAN or UTRAN radio access technology and disable the E-UTRA capability (see subclause 4.5).

The network receiving a TRACKING AREA UPDATE COMPLETE message stops timer T3450, changes to state
EMM-REGISTERED.

   NOTE 2: Upon receiving a TRACKING AREA UPDATE COMPLETE message, if a new TMSI was included in
           the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, the MME sends an SGsAP-TMSI-
           REALLOCATION-COMPLETE message as specified in 3GPP TS 29.118 [16A].

5.5.3.3.4.3              Combined tracking area updating successful for EPS services only

Apart from the actions on the tracking area updating attempt counter, the description for tracking area for EPS services
as specified in subclause 5.5.3.2.4 shall be followed. In addition, the following description for location updating for
non-EPS services applies.

The UE receiving the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message takes one of the following actions depending
on the EMM cause value:

   #2 (IMSI unknown in HSS)

          The UE shall stop T3430 if still running and shall reset the tracking area updating attempt counter. The UE
          shall set the update status to U3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED and shall delete any TMSI, LAI and ciphering
          key sequence number. The UE shall enter state EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE. The new MM
          state is MM IDLE. The USIM shall be considered as invalid for non-EPS services until switching off or the
          UICC containing the USIM is removed or the timer T3245 expires as described subclause 5.3.7a. If the UE
          maintains a counter for "SIM/USIM considered invalid for non-GPRS services", then the UE shall set this
          counter to UE implementation-specific maximum value.

   #16    (MSC temporarily not reachable); or

   #17    (Network failure)

          The UE shall stop timer T3430 if still running, and shall enter state MM IDLE. The tracking area updating
          attempt counter shall be incremented, unless it was already set to 5.

          If the tracking area updating attempt counter is less than 5:

          -   the UE shall start timer T3411, shall set the EPS update status to EU1 UPDATED and shall enter state
              EMM-REGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-UPDATE-MM. When timer T3411 expires the combined
              tracking area updating procedure indicating "combined TA/LA updating with IMSI attach" is triggered
              again.

          If the tracking area updating attempt counter is equal to 5:

          -   a UE operating in CS/PS mode 2 of operation and a UE operating in CS/PS mode 1 of operation with
              "IMS voice available" shall start timer T3402, shall set the EPS update status to EU1 UPDATED and
              shall enter state EMM-REGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-UPDATE-MM. When timer T3402 expires
              the combined tracking area updating procedure indicating "combined TA/LA updating with IMSI attach"
              is triggered again;

          -   a UE operating in CS/PS mode 1 of operation with "IMS voice not available" without a persistent EPS
              bearer context shall attempt to select GERAN or UTRAN radio access technology and proceed with
              appropriate MM or GMM specific procedures and disable the E-UTRA capability (see subclause 4.5);

          -   a UE operating in CS/PS mode 1 of operation with "IMS voice not available" and with a persistent EPS
              bearer context shall start timer T3402, shall set the EPS update status to EU1 UPDATED and shall enter
              state EMM-REGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-UPDATE-MM. When timer T3402 expires the
              combined tracking area updating procedure indicating "combined TA/LA updating with IMSI attach" is
              triggered again. When the radio bearer associated with the persistent EPS bearer context has been
              released and the UE is registered for EPS services only, operating in CS/PS mode 1 of operation with
              "IMS voice not available", then the UE shall stop timer T3402, if already running, attempt to select
              GERAN or UTRAN radio access technology and proceed with appropriate MM or GMM specific
              procedures and disable the E-UTRA capability (see subclause 4.5).

   #18    (CS domain not available)

          The UE shall stop timer T3430 if still running, shall reset the tracking area updating attempt counter, shall set
          the EPS update status to EU1 UPDATED and shall enter state EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE.

          The UE shall enter state MM IDLE and shall set the update status to U2 NOT UPDATED.

          A UE in CS/PS mode 1 of operation with "IMS voice not available" without a persistent EPS bearer context
          shall attempt to select GERAN or UTRAN radio access technology rather than E-UTRAN for the registered
          PLMN or equivalent PLMN and disable the E-UTRA capability (see subclause 4.5).

          A UE in CS/PS mode 1 of operation with "IMS voice not available" and with a persistent EPS bearer context
          shall, after the radio bearer associated with the persistent EPS bearer context has been released, attempt to
          select GERAN or UTRAN radio access technology rather than E-UTRAN for the registered PLMN or
          equivalent PLMN and disable the E-UTRA capability (see subclause 4.5).

          A UE in CS/PS mode 2 of operation and a UE operating in CS/PS mode 1 of operation with "IMS voice
          available" may provide a notification to the user or the upper layers that the CS domain is not available.

          The UE shall not attempt combined attach or combined tracking area updating procedure with current PLMN
          until switching off the UE or the UICC containing the USIM is removed.

   #22    (Congestion)

          The UE shall stop timer T3430 if still running. The tracking area updating attempt counter shall be set to 5.
          The UE shall start timer T3402, shall set the EPS update status to EU1 UPDATED, shall enter state EMM-
          REGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-UPDATE-MM, shall enter state MM IDLE.

Other EMM cause values and the case that no EMM cause IE was received are considered as abnormal cases. The
combined tracking area updating procedure shall be considered as failed for non-EPS services. The behaviour of the UE
in those cases is specified in subclause 5.5.3.3.6.

5.5.3.3.5           Combined tracking area updating procedure not accepted by the network
If the combined tracking area updating cannot be accepted by the network, the MME shall send a TRACKING AREA
UPDATE REJECT message to the UE including an appropriate EMM cause value.

If the MME locally deactivates EPS bearer contexts for the UE (see subclause 5.5.3.2.4) and no active EPS bearer
contexts remain for the UE, the MME shall send the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REJECT message including the
EMM cause value #10 "implicitly detached".

If the tracking area update request is rejected due to general NAS level mobility management congestion control, the
network shall set the EMM cause value to #22 "congestion" and assign a back-off timer T3346.

If the UE initiated the tracking area updating procedure due to inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode, and the
MME does not support N26 interface, the MME shall send a TRACKING AREA UPDATE REJECT message with
EMM cause value #9 "UE identity cannot be derived by the network".

If the tracking area request is rejected due to service gap control as specified in subclause 5.3.17 i.e. the T3447 timer is
running, the network shall set the EMM cause value to #22 "congestion" and may assign a back-off timer T3346 with
the remaining time of the running T3447 timer.

Upon receiving the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REJECT message, if the message is integrity protected or contains a
reject cause other than EMM cause value #25, the UE shall stop timer T3430, stop any transmission of user data and
enter state MM IDLE.

If the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REJECT message with EMM cause #25 was received without integrity protection,
then the UE shall discard the message.

The UE shall take the following actions depending on the EMM cause value received in the TRACKING AREA
UPDATE REJECT message.

   #3 (Illegal UE);

   #6 (Illegal ME); or

   #8 (EPS services and non-EPS services not allowed);

       The UE shall set the EPS update status to EU3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED (and shall store it according to
       subclause 5.1.3.3) and shall delete any GUTI, last visited registered TAI, TAI List and eKSI.

       The UE shall consider the USIM as invalid for EPS and non-EPS services until switching off or the UICC
       containing the USIM is removed or the timer T3245 expires as described in subclause 5.3.7a. Additionally, the
       UE shall delete the list of equivalent PLMNs and shall enter the state EMM-DEREGISTERED. If the message
       has been successfully integrity checked by the NAS and the UE maintains a counter for "SIM/USIM considered
       invalid for GPRS services", then the UE shall set this counter to UE implementation-specific maximum value. If
       the message has been successfully integrity checked by the NAS and the UE maintains a counter for "SIM/USIM
       considered invalid for non-GPRS services", then the UE shall set this counter to UE implementation-specific
       maximum value.

       If A/Gb mode or Iu mode is supported by the UE, the UE shall handle the MM parameters update status, TMSI,
       LAI and ciphering key sequence number, and the GMM parameters GMM state, GPRS update status, P-TMSI,
       P-TMSI signature, RAI and GPRS ciphering key sequence number as specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 [13] for the
       case when the combined routing area updating procedure is rejected with the GMM cause with the same value.

       If the UE is operating in single-registration mode, the UE shall in addition handle the 5GMM parameters as
       specified in 3GPP TS 24.501 [54] for the case when the registration procedure for mobility and periodic
       registration update indicating "mobility registration updating" in the 5GS registration type IE of the
       REGISTRATION REQUEST message is rejected with the 5GMM cause with the same value.

   #7 (EPS services not allowed);

       The UE shall set the EPS update status to EU3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED (and shall store it according to
       subclause 5.1.3.3) and shall delete any GUTI, last visited registered TAI, TAI List and eKSI. The UE shall
       consider then USIM as invalid for EPS services until switching off or the UICC containing the USIM is removed
       or the timer T3245 expires as described in subclause 5.3.7a. The UE shall delete the list of equivalent PLMNs
       and shall enter the state EMM-DEREGISTERED. If the message has been successfully integrity checked by the
       NAS and the UE maintains a counter for "SIM/USIM considered invalid for GPRS services", then the UE shall
       set this counter to UE implementation-specific maximum value.

       A UE in CS/PS mode 1 or CS/PS mode 2 of operation which is already IMSI attached for non-EPS services is
       still IMSI attached for non-EPS services.

      A UE in CS/PS mode 1 or CS/PS mode 2 of operation shall set the update status to U2 NOT UPDATED, shall
      attempt to select GERAN or UTRAN radio access technology and proceed with appropriate MM specific
      procedure according to the MM service state. The UE shall not reselect E-UTRAN radio access technology until
      switching off or the UICC containing the USIM is removed.

      If A/Gb mode or Iu mode is supported by the UE, the UE shall in addition handle the GMM parameters GMM
      state, GPRS update status, P-TMSI, P-TMSI signature, RAI and GPRS ciphering key sequence number as
      specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 [13] for the case when the combined routing area updating procedure is rejected

   #9 (UE identity cannot be derived by the network);

      The UE shall set the EPS update status to EU2 NOT UPDATED (and shall store it according to
      subclause 5.1.3.3) and shall delete any GUTI, last visited registered TAI, TAI List and eKSI. The UE shall enter
      the state EMM-DEREGISTERED.

      If there is a CS fallback emergency call pending or CS fallback call pending, or a paging for CS fallback, the UE
      shall attempt to select GERAN or UTRAN radio access technology. If the UE finds a suitable GERAN or
      UTRAN cell, it then proceeds with the appropriate MM and CC specific procedures; otherwise, if there is a CS
      fallback emergency call or CS fallback call pending, the EMM sublayer shall indicate the abort of the EMM
      procedure to the MM sublayer.

      If there is a 1xCS fallback emergency call pending or 1xCS fallback call pending, or a paging for 1xCS fallback,
      the UE shall select cdma2000® 1x radio access technology. The UE then proceeds with appropriate cdma2000®

      If the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REJECT message is not integrity protected, the UE shall start timer T3346
      with a random value from the default range specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 [13].

      The UE stays in the current serving cell and applies the normal cell reselection process. The tracking area
      updating procedure is started, if still necessary, when timer T3346 expires or is stopped.

      If A/Gb mode or Iu mode is supported by the UE, the UE shall handle the GMM parameters GMM state, GPRS
      update status and routing area updating attempt counter as specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 [13] for the case when
      the combined routing area updating procedure is rejected with the GMM cause with the same value.

      REGISTRATION REQUEST message is rejected with the 5GMM cause with the same value.

   #25   (Not authorized for this CSG);

      EMM cause #25 is only applicable when received from a CSG cell. EMM cause #25 received from a non-CSG
      cell is considered as an abnormal case and the behaviour of the UE is specified in subclause 5.5.3.3.6.

      The UE shall set the EPS update status to EU3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED (and store it according to

      If there is a CS fallback emergency call pending or CS fallback call pending, or a paging for CS fallback, the UE
      shall attempt to select GERAN or UTRAN radio access technology. If the UE finds a suitable GERAN or
      UTRAN cell, it then proceeds with the appropriate MM and CC specific procedures; otherwise, if there is a CS
      fallback emergency call or CS fallback call pending, the EMM sublayer shall indicate the abort of the EMM
      procedure to the MM sublayer.

      If there is a 1xCS fallback emergency call pending or 1xCS fallback call pending, or a paging for 1xCS fallback,

       cause value #10 "Implicitly detached".

       A UE in CS/PS mode 1 or CS/PS mode 2 of operation which is already IMSI attached for non-EPS services is
       still IMSI attached for non-EPS services.

       A UE in CS/PS mode 1 or CS/PS mode 2 of operation shall set the update status to U2 NOT UPDATED.

   #42    (Severe network failure);

       The UE shall set the EPS update status to EU2 NOT UPDATED, and shall delete any GUTI, last visited
       registered TAI, eKSI, and list of equivalent PLMNs, and set the tracking area updating attempt counter to 5. The
       UE shall start an implementation specific timer, setting its value to 2 times the value of T as defined in
       3GPP TS 23.122 [6]. While this timer is running, the UE shall not consider the PLMN + RAT combination that
       provided this reject cause as a candidate for PLMN selection. The UE then enters state EMM-
       DEREGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH in order to perform a PLMN selection according to 3GPP TS 23.122 [6].

       If A/Gb mode or Iu mode is supported by the UE, the UE shall in addition set the GMM state to GMM-
       DEREGISTERED, GPRS update status to GU2 NOT UPDATED, and shall delete the P-TMSI, P-TMSI
       signature, RAI and GPRS ciphering key sequence number.

Other values are considered as abnormal cases. The behaviour of the UE in those cases is specified in
subclause 5.5.3.3.6.

5.5.3.3.6            Abnormal cases in the UE
The UE shall proceed as follows:

   1) if the UE requested the combined tracking area update for EPS services and "SMS only" and the TRACKING
      AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message indicates a combined tracking area updating procedure successful for EPS
      and non-EPS services, the UE shall behave as if the combined tracking area updating procedure was successful
      for EPS services and "SMS only";

   NOTE:      In this case the UE can ignore the CS SERVICE NOTIFICATION message or the Paging with CN
              domain indicator set to "CS", as specified in subclause 5.6.2.3.2.

   2) if the combined tracking area update was successful for EPS services only and the TRACKING AREA
      UPDATE ACCEPT message contained an EMM cause value not treated in subclause 5.5.3.3.4.3 or the EMM
      Cause IE is not included in the message, the UE shall proceed as follows:

       a) The UE shall stop timer T3430 if still running, and shall enter state MM IDLE. The tracking area updating
          attempt counter shall be incremented, unless it was already set to 5;

       b) If the tracking area updating attempt counter is less than 5:

          -   the UE shall start timer T3411, shall set the EPS update status to EU1 UPDATED and shall enter state
              EMM-REGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-UPDATE-MM. When timer T3411 expires the combined
              tracking area updating procedure indicating "combined TA/LA updating with IMSI attach" is triggered
              again;

       c) If the tracking area updating attempt counter is equal to 5:

          -   a UE operating in CS/PS mode 2 of operation and a UE operating in CS/PS mode 1 of operation with
              "IMS voice available" shall start timer T3402, shall set the EPS update status to EU1 UPDATED and
              shall enter state EMM-REGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-UPDATE-MM. When timer T3402 expires
              the combined tracking area updating procedure indicating "combined TA/LA updating with IMSI attach"
              is triggered again; and

          -   a UE operating in CS/PS mode 1 of operation with "IMS voice not available" shall attempt to select
              GERAN, UTRAN or NG-RAN radio access technology, proceed with appropriate MM, GMM or 5GMM
              specific procedures and disable the E-UTRA capability (see subclause 4.5); and

       d) If there is a CS fallback emergency call or CS fallback call pending, or a paging for CS fallback, the UE shall
          attempt to select GERAN or UTRAN radio access technology. If the UE finds a suitable GERAN or UTRAN
          cell, it then proceeds with the appropriate MM and CC specific procedures; otherwise, if there is a CS

          procedure to the MM sublayer; and

   3) otherwise, the abnormal cases specified in subclause 5.5.3.2.6 apply with the following modification.

       If the tracking area updating attempt counter is incremented according to subclause 5.5.3.2.6 the next actions
       depend on the value of the tracking area updating attempt counter.

       -   If the tracking area updating attempt counter is less than 5, the UE shall set the update status to U2 NOT
           UPDATED, but shall not delete any LAI, TMSI, ciphering key sequence number and list of equivalent
           PLMNs; or

       -   if the tracking area updating attempt counter is equal to 5, the UE shall delete any LAI, TMSI and ciphering
           key sequence number and set the update status to U2 NOT UPDATED.

       If there is a CS fallback emergency call pending or CS fallback call pending, or a paging for CS fallback, the UE
       shall attempt to select GERAN or UTRAN radio access technology. If the UE finds a suitable GERAN or
       UTRAN cell, it then proceeds with the appropriate MM and CC specific procedures; otherwise if there is a CS
       fallback emergency call or CS fallback call pending, the EMM sublayer shall indicate the abort of the EMM
       procedure to the MM sublayer.

The abnormal cases specified in subclause 5.5.3.2.7 apply.


5.5.4         eCall inactivity procedure
The eCall inactivity procedure is applicable only to a UE configured for eCall only mode as specified in
3GPP TS 31.102 [17]. The procedure shall be started when:

       -   the UE is in any EMM-REGISTERED substate except substates EMM-REGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH or
           EMM-REGISTERED.NO-CELL-AVAILABLE;

       -   the UE is in EMM-IDLE mode, and

       -   one of the following conditions applies:

           1) timer T3444 expires or is found to have already expired and timer T3445 is not running;

           2) timer T3445 expires or is found to have already expired and timer T3444 is not running; or

           3) timers T3444 and T3445 expire or are found to have already expired.

The UE shall then perform the following actions:

   -   stop other running timers (e.g. T3411, T3412);

   -   if the UE is currently registered to EPS services only, perform a detach procedure for EPS services only;

   -   if the UE is currently registered for both EPS services and non-EPS services, perform a combined detach
       procedure for EPS services and non-EPS services;

   -   delete any GUTI, TAI list, last visited registered TAI, list of equivalent PLMNs, and KSI; and

   -   enter EMM-DEREGISTERED.eCALL-INACTIVE state.


5.5.5         Tracking area update request message (for N1 mode only)
The tracking area updating procedure is used to construct a TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message for the
inter-system change from S1 mode to N1 mode for further security verification by the MME.

The TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message is created by EMM by request of 5GMM which further
includes the message in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message as described in 3GPP TS 24.501 [54].

The TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message shall contain only mandatory information elements.

The UE shall set the EPS update type IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message to "TA updating".

If the UE has a current EPS security context, the UE shall include the eKSI (either KSIASME or KSISGSN) in the NAS
Key Set Identifier IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message. Otherwise, the UE shall set the NAS
Key Set Identifier IE to the value "no key is available". If the UE has a current EPS security context, the UE shall
integrity protect the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message with the current EPS security context and
increase the uplink NAS COUNT by one. Otherwise the UE shall not integrity protect the TRACKING AREA
UPDATE REQUEST message. The UE shall set associated GUTI in the Old GUTI IE.

When the UE is in EMM-REGISTERED.NO-CELL-AVAILABLE substate and needs to construct the TRACKING
AREA UPDATE REQUEST message for inter-system change from S1 mode to N1 mode, the UE shall consider that
the tracking area updating procedure is not initiated and the UE shall remain in EMM-REGISTERED.NO-CELL-
AVAILABLE state.


5.6           EMM connection management procedures (S1 mode only)
5.6.1         Service request procedure

5.6.1.1          General
The purpose of the service request procedure is to transfer the EMM mode from EMM-IDLE to EMM-CONNECTED
mode. If the UE is not using EPS services with control plane CIoT EPS optimization, this procedure is used to establish
the radio and S1 bearers when user data or signalling is to be sent. If the UE is using EPS services with control plane
CIoT EPS optimization, this procedure can be used for UE initiated transfer of user data via the control plane. Another
purpose of this procedure is to invoke MO/MT CS fallback or 1xCS fallback procedures.

This procedure is used when:

   -   the network has downlink signalling pending;

   -   the UE has uplink signalling pending;

   -   the UE or the network has user data pending and the UE is in EMM-IDLE mode;

   -   the UE is in EMM-CONNECTED mode and has a NAS signalling connection only; the UE is using EPS
       services with control plane CIoT EPS optimization, and it has user data pending which is to be transferred via
       user plane radio bearers;

   -   the UE in EMM-IDLE or EMM-CONNECTED mode has requested to perform mobile originating/terminating
       CS fallback or 1xCS fallback;

   -   the UE has to request resources for ProSe direct discovery or Prose direct communication; or

   -   the UE has to request resources for V2X communication over PC5.

The service request procedure is initiated by the UE, however, for the downlink transfer of signalling, cdma2000®
signalling or user data in EMM-IDLE mode, the trigger is given by the network by means of the paging procedure (see
subclause 5.6.2).

The UE shall invoke the service request procedure when:

   a) the UE in EMM-IDLE mode receives a paging request using S-TMSI with CN domain indicator set to "PS" from
      the network;

5.6.1.2           Service request procedure initiation

5.6.1.2.1             UE is not using EPS services with control plane CIoT EPS optimization
For cases a, b, c, h, k and l in subclause 5.6.1.1:

   -   if the UE is not configured for NAS signalling low priority, the UE initiates the service request procedure by
       sending a SERVICE REQUEST message to the MME;

   -   if the UE is configured for NAS signalling low priority, and the last received ATTACH ACCEPT message or
       TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message from the network indicated that the network supports use of
       EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST for packet services, the UE shall send an EXTENDED SERVICE
       REQUEST message with service type set to "packet services via S1"; or

   NOTE:       A UE configured for dual priority is configured for NAS signalling low priority indicator.

   -   if the UE is configured for NAS signalling low priority and the last received ATTACH ACCEPT message or
       TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message from the network did not indicate that the network supports
       use of EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST for packet services, the UE shall instead send a SERVICE
       REQUEST message.

For cases a, b, c, h, k and l in subclause 5.6.1.1, after sending the SERVICE REQUEST message or the EXTENDED
SERVICE REQUEST message with service type set to "packet services via S1", the UE shall start T3417 and enter the
state EMM-SERVICE-REQUEST-INITIATED.

For case d in subclause 5.6.1.1, the UE shall send an EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST message, start T3417ext and
enter the state EMM-SERVICE-REQUEST-INITIATED.

For case e in subclause 5.6.1.1:

   -   if the UE is in EMM-IDLE mode, the UE shall send an EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST message, start
       T3417ext-mt and enter the state EMM-SERVICE-REQUEST-INITIATED;

   -   if the UE is in EMM-CONNECTED mode and if the UE accepts the paging, the UE shall send an EXTENDED
       SERVICE REQUEST message with the CSFB response IE indicating "CS fallback accepted by the UE", start
       T3417ext-mt and enter the state EMM-SERVICE-REQUEST-INITIATED; or

   -   if the UE is in EMM-CONNECTED mode and if the UE rejects the paging, the UE shall send an EXTENDED
       SERVICE REQUEST message with the CSFB response IE indicating "CS fallback rejected by the UE" and
       enter the state EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE. The network shall not initiate CS fallback
       procedures.

For cases f, g, i and j in subclause 5.6.1.1, the UE shall send an EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST message, start
T3417 and enter the state EMM-SERVICE-REQUEST-INITIATED.

5.6.1.2.2             UE is using EPS services with control plane CIoT EPS optimization
The UE shall send a CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message, start T3417 and enter the state EMM-
SERVICE-REQUEST-INITIATED.

For case a in subclause 5.6.1.1, the Control plane service type of the CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST
message shall indicate "mobile terminating request". The UE may include the ESM DATA TRANSPORT message. The
UE shall not include any ESM message other than ESM DATA TRANSPORT message.

For case b in subclause 5.6.1.1,

   -   if the UE has pending IP or non-IP user data that is to be sent via the control plane radio bearers, the Control
       plane service type of the CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message shall indicate "mobile originating
       request". The UE shall include an ESM DATA TRANSPORT message in the ESM message container IE. If the
       UE supports the CP-EDT (see 3GPP TS 36.300 [20]), the UE shall provide the CONTROL PLANE SERVICE
       REQUEST message in the NAS request to the lower layer to establish a RRC connection as specified in
       subclause 5.3.1.1.

For cases b and m in subclause 5.6.1.1,

   -   if the UE has pending IP or non-IP user data that is to be sent via the user plane radio bearers, the UE shall set
       the Control plane service type of the CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message to "mobile originating
       request" and the "active" flag in the Control plane service type IE to 1. The UE shall not include any ESM
       message container or NAS message container IE in the CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message.

For case c in subclause 5.6.1.1, the UE shall set the Control plane service type of the CONTROL PLANE SERVICE
REQUEST message to "mobile originating request". If the CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message is:

   -   for sending SMS , the UE shall include the SMS message in the NAS message container IE and shall not include
       any ESM message container IE in the CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message ; and

   -   for sending signalling different from SMS, the UE shall not include any ESM message container or NAS
       message container IE in the CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message.

5.6.1.3           EMM common procedure initiation
Upon receipt of the SERVICE REQUEST, EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST or CONTROL PLANE SERVICE
REQUEST message, the MME may initiate the EMM common procedures, e.g. the authentication procedure and
security mode control procedure.

5.6.1.4           Service request procedure accepted by the network

5.6.1.4.1            UE is not using EPS services with control plane CIoT EPS optimization
If EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is supported by the UE and the MME and the MME has no active
EPS bearer contexts for the UE, for cases a, b and c in subclause 5.6.1.1, upon receipt of the SERVICE REQUEST
message or the EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST message for packet services, after completion of the EMM common
procedures according to subclause 5.6.1.3, if any, the MME shall send a SERVICE ACCEPT message.

If EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is supported by the UE and the MME and the UE has no active EPS
bearer contexts, for cases a, b and c in subclause 5.6.1.1, the UE shall treat the receipt of a SERVICE ACCEPT message
as successful completion of the procedure. Otherwise, for cases a, b, c, h, k and l in subclause 5.6.1.1, the UE shall treat
the indication from the lower layers that the user plane radio bearer is set up as successful completion of the procedure.
The UE shall reset the service request attempt counter, stop the timer T3417 and enter the state EMM-REGISTERED.

If the service type information element in the EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST message indicates "mobile
terminating CS fallback or 1xCS fallback" and the CSFB response IE, if included, indicates "CS fallback accepted by
the UE", or if the service type information element in the EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST message indicates
"mobile originating CS fallback or 1xCS fallback" or "mobile originating CS fallback emergency call or 1xCS fallback
emergency call", the network initiates CS fallback or 1xCS fallback procedures.

If the EPS bearer context status IE is included in the EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST message, the network shall
deactivate all those EPS bearer contexts locally (without peer-to-peer signalling between the network and the UE)
which are active on the network side but are indicated by the UE as being inactive. If a default EPS bearer context is
marked as inactive in the EPS bearer context status IE included in the EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST message, and
this default bearer is not associated with the last remaining PDN connection of the UE in the MME, the MME shall
locally deactivate all EPS bearer contexts associated to the PDN connection with the default EPS bearer context without
peer-to-peer ESM signalling to the UE. If the default bearer is associated with the last remaining PDN connection of the
UE in the MME, and EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is supported by the UE and the MME, the MME
shall locally deactivate all EPS bearer contexts associated to the PDN connection with the default EPS bearer context
without peer-to-peer ESM signalling to the UE.

If the SERVICE REQUEST message or the EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST message for packet services, was sent
in a CSG cell and the CSG subscription has expired or was removed for a UE, but the UE has a PDN connection for
emergency bearer services established, the network shall accept the SERVICE REQUEST message or the EXTENDED
SERVICE REQUEST message for packet services and deactivate all non-emergency EPS bearers locally. The
emergency EPS bearers shall not be deactivated.

For cases d in subclause 5.6.1.1, and for case e in subclause 5.6.1.1 when the CSFB response was set to "CS fallback
accepted by the UE", the UE shall treat the indication from the lower layers that the inter-system change from S1 mode
to A/Gb or Iu mode is completed as successful completion of the procedure. The EMM sublayer in the UE shall indicate

to the MM sublayer that the CS fallback procedure has succeeded. The UE shall stop the timer T3417ext or T3417ext-
mt, respectively, and enter the state EMM-REGISTERED.NO-CELL-AVAILABLE.

If the service request procedure was initiated in EMM-IDLE mode and an EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST message
was sent in a CSG cell and the CSG subscription has expired or was removed for the UE, the network need not perform
CSG access control if the service type information element indicates "mobile originating CS fallback emergency call or
1xCS fallback emergency call".

For cases f and g in subclause 5.6.1.1:

   -   if the UE receives the indication from the lower layers that the signalling connection is released with the
       redirection indication to cdma2000® 1x access network or the indication from the lower layers that a change to
       cdma2000® 1x access network for 1xCS fallback has started (see 3GPP TS 36.331 [22]), the UE shall consider
       the service request procedure successfully completed, stop timer T3417 and enter the state EMM-
       REGISTERED.NO-CELL-AVAILABLE;

   -   if the UE receives the dual Rx/Tx redirection indication from the lower layers (see 3GPP TS 36.331 [22]), the
       UE shall select cdma2000® 1x access network for 1xCS fallback, consider the service request procedure
       successfully completed, stop timer T3417 and enter the state EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE; and

   -   if the UE receives a cdma2000® signalling message indicating 1xCS fallback rejection by cdma2000® 1x access
       network, the UE shall abort the service request procedure, stop timer T3417 and enter the state EMM-
       REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE.

For cases i and j in subclause 5.6.1.1, if the UE receives the indication from the lower layers that the signalling
connection is released, the UE shall consider the service request procedure successfully completed, stop timer T3417
and enter the state EMM-REGISTERED.NO-CELL-AVAILABLE.

If the SERVICE REQUEST message or an EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST message for packet services was used,
the UE shall locally deactivate the EPS bearer contexts that do not have a user plane radio bearer established upon
successful completion of the service request procedure.

If the EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST message is for CS fallback or 1xCS fallback and radio bearer establishment
takes place during the procedure, the UE shall locally deactivate the EPS bearer contexts that do not have a user plane
radio bearer established upon receiving a lower layer indication of radio bearer establishment. The UE does not perform
local deactivation of EPS bearer contexts upon receiving an indication of inter-system change from lower layers.

If the EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST message is for CS fallback or 1xCS fallback and radio bearer establishment
does not take place during the procedure, the UE does not perform local deactivation of the EPS bearer context. The UE
does not perform local deactivation of EPS bearer contexts upon receiving an indication of inter-system change from
lower layers.

If a service request is received from a UE with a LIPA PDN connection, and if:

   -   a GW Transport Layer Address IE value identifying a L-GW is provided by the lower layer together with the
       service request, and the P-GW address included in the EPS bearer context of the LIPA PDN connection is
       different from the provided GW Transport Layer Address IE value (see 3GPP TS 36.413 [23]); or

   -   no GW Transport Layer Address is provided together with the service request by the lower layer;

then the MME shall locally deactivate all EPS bearer contexts associated with any LIPA PDN connection. Furthermore,
if no active EPS bearer contexts remain for the UE, the MME shall not accept the service request as specified in
subclause 5.6.1.5.

If a service request is received from a UE with a SIPTO at the local network PDN connection, and if the PDN
connection is a:

       1) SIPTO at the local network PDN connection with stand-alone GW, and if:

       -   a LHN-ID value is provided by the lower layer together with the service request, and the LHN-ID value
           stored in the EPS bearer context of the SIPTO at the local network PDN connection is different from the
           provided LHN-ID value (see 3GPP TS 36.413 [23]); or

       -   no LHN-ID value is provided together with the service request by the lower layer; or

       2) SIPTO at the local network PDN connection with collocated L-GW, and if:

       -   a SIPTO L-GW Transport Layer Address IE value identifying a L-GW is provided by the lower layer
           together with the service request, and the P-GW address included in the EPS bearer context of the SIPTO at
           the local network PDN connection is different from the provided SIPTO L-GW Transport Layer Address IE
           value (see 3GPP TS 36.413 [23]); or

       -   no SIPTO L-GW Transport Layer Address is provided together with the service request by the lower layer;

then, the MME takes one of the following actions:

       -   if all the remaining PDN connections are SIPTO at the local network PDN connections, the MME shall not
           accept the service request as specified in subclause 5.6.1.5; and

       -   if a PDN connection remains that is not SIPTO at the local network PDN connection and the network decides
           to set up the S1 and radio bearers, the MME shall upon completion of the setup of the S1 bearers initiate an
           EPS bearer context deactivation procedure with ESM cause #39 "reactivation requested" for the default EPS
           bearer context of each SIPTO at the local network PDN connection (see subclause 6.4.4.2).

   NOTE:      For some cases of CS fallback or 1x CS fallback the network can decide not to set up any S1 and radio
              bearers.

When the E-UTRAN fails to establish radio bearers for one or more EPS bearer contexts, then the MME shall locally
deactivate the EPS bearer contexts corresponding to the failed radio bearers based on the lower layer indication from
the E-UTRAN, without notifying the UE.

If the UE is not using EPS services with control plane CIoT EPS optimization, the network shall consider the service
request procedure successfully completed in the following cases:

   -   when it receives an indication from the lower layer that the user plane is setup, if radio bearer establishment is
       required;

   -   otherwise when it receives an indication from the lower layer that the UE has been redirected to the other RAT
       (GERAN or UTRAN in CS fallback, or cdma2000® 1x access network for 1xCS fallback).

5.6.1.4.2            UE is using EPS services with control plane CIoT EPS optimization
For case a in subclause 5.6.1.1, upon receipt of the CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message with Control
plane service type indicating "mobile terminating request", after completion of the EMM common procedures according
to subclause 5.6.1.3:

   1) if the MME needs to perform an EPS bearer context status synchronization

       -   for an EPS bearer context associated with Control plane only indication; or

       -   for an EPS bearer context not associated with Control plane only indication, there is no downlink user data
           pending to be delivered via the user plane, and the UE did not set the "active" flag in the Control plane
           service type IE to 1; or

   2) if the control plane data back-off time for the UE is stored in MME and the MME decides to deactivate
      congestion control for transport of user data via the control plane,

then the MME shall send a SERVICE ACCEPT message.

Furthermore the MME may:

   1) initiate the transport of user data via the control plane procedure or any other NAS signalling procedure;

   2) if supported by the UE and required by the network, initiate the setup of the user plane radio bearer(s); or

   3) send a NAS signalling message not related to an EMM common procedure to the UE if downlink signalling is
      pending.

For case b in subclause 5.6.1.1, upon receipt of the CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message with Control
plane service type indicating "mobile originating request", after completion of the EMM common procedures according
to subclause 5.6.1.3, if any, if the MME needs to perform an EPS bearer context status synchronization

   -   for an EPS bearer context associated with Control plane only indication; or

   -   for an EPS bearer context not associated with Control plane only indication, there is no downlink user data
       pending to be delivered via the user plane, and the UE did not set the "active" flag in the Control plane service
       type IE to 1,

then the MME shall send a SERVICE ACCEPT message.

Furthermore, the MME may:

   1) initiate release of the NAS signalling connection upon receipt of an indication from the ESM layer (see
      subclause 6.6.4.2), unless the MME has additional downlink user data or signalling pending;

   2) initiate the setup of the user plane radio bearer(s), if downlink user data is pending to be delivered via the user
      plane or the UE has set the "active" flag in the Control plane service type IE to 1;

   3) send an ESM DATA TRANSPORT message to the UE, if downlink user data is pending to be delivered via the
      control plane;

   4) send a NAS signalling message not related to an EMM common procedure to the UE if downlink signalling is
      pending; or

   5) send a SERVICE ACCEPT message to complete the service request procedure, if no NAS security mode control
      procedure was initiated, the MME did not send a SERVICE ACCEPT message as specified above to perform an
      EPS bearer context status synchronization, and the MME did not initiate any of the procedures specified in item
      1 to 4 above.

   NOTE 1: The MME can initiate the setup of the user plane radio bearer(s) if the MME decides to activate the
           congestion control for transport of user data via the control plane.

For case m in subclause 5.6.1.1, upon receipt of the CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message with Control
plane service type indicating "mobile originating request" and the "active" flag in the Control plane service type IE set
to 1:

   1) if the MME accepts the request, the MME shall initiate the setup of the user plane radio bearer(s) for all active
      EPS bearer contexts of SGi PDN connections that are established without control plane only indication.

   2) if the MME does not accept the request, the MME shall send a SERVICE ACCEPT message to complete the
      service request procedure.

   NOTE 2: The MME takes into account the maximum number of user plane radio bearers supported by the UE, in
           addition to local policies and the UE's preferred CIoT network behaviour when deciding whether to
           accept the request to establish user plane bearer(s) as described in subclause 5.3.15. If the MME accepts
           the request, all SGi PDN connections are considered as established without Control plane only indication.

   NOTE 3: In this release of the specification, a UE in NB-S1 mode can support a maximum of 2 user plane radio
           bearers (see subclause 6.5.0).

For case c in subclause 5.6.1.1, upon receipt of the CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message with Control
plane service type indicating "mobile originating request" and without an ESM message container IE, after completion
of the EMM common procedures according to subclause 5.6.1.3, if any, the MME proceeds as follows:

If the MME needs to perform an EPS bearer context status synchronization

   -   for an EPS bearer context associated with Control plane only indication; or

   -   for an EPS bearer context not associated with Control plane only indication, and there is no downlink user data
       pending to be delivered via the user plane,

then the MME shall send a SERVICE ACCEPT message.

Furthermore, the MME may:

   1) initiate the setup of the user plane radio bearer(s), if downlink user data is pending to be delivered via the user
      plane;

   2) send an ESM DATA TRANSPORT message to the UE, if downlink user data is pending to be delivered via the
      control plane;

   3) send a NAS signalling message not related to an EMM common procedure to the UE, if downlink signalling is
      pending; or

   4) send a SERVICE ACCEPT message to complete the service request procedure, if no NAS security mode control
      procedure was initiated, the MME did not send a SERVICE ACCEPT message as specified above to perform an
      EPS bearer context status synchronization, and the MME did not initiate any of the procedures specified in item
      1 to 3 above.

In NB-S1 mode, for cases a, b, c and m in subclause 5.6.1.1, if the MME needs to initiate the setup of user plane radio
bearer(s), the MME shall check if the UE can support the establishment of additional user plane radio bearer based on
the multiple DRB support indicated by UE in the UE network capability IE.

For cases a, b and c in subclause 5.6.1.1, if the EPS bearer context status IE is included in the CONTROL PLANE
SERVICE REQUEST message, the network shall deactivate all those EPS bearer contexts locally (without peer-to-peer
signalling between the network and the UE) which are active on the network side but are indicated by the UE as being
inactive. If a default EPS bearer context is marked as inactive in the EPS bearer context status IE included in the
CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message, and this default bearer is not associated with the last PDN
connection of the UE in the MME, the MME shall locally deactivate all EPS bearer contexts associated to the PDN
connection with the default EPS bearer context without peer-to-peer ESM signalling to the UE. If the default bearer is
associated with the last remaining PDN connection of the UE in the MME, and EMM-REGISTERED without PDN
connection is supported by the UE and the MME, the MME shall locally deactivate all EPS bearer contexts associated
to the PDN connection with the default EPS bearer context without peer-to-peer ESM signalling to the UE.

If the EPS bearer context status IE is included in the CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST and the MME decides
to respond with a SERVICE ACCEPT message, the MME shall include an EPS bearer context status IE, indicating
which EPS bearer contexts are active in the MME, except for the case when no EPS bearer context exists on the
network side.

If the MME needs to initiate an EPS bearer context status synchronization, the MME may include an EPS bearer
context status IE in the SERVICE ACCEPT message also if no EPS bearer context status IE was included in the
CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message.

If the MME sends a SERVICE ACCEPT message upon receipt of the CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST
message piggybacked with the ESM DATA TRANSPORT message:

   -   if the Release assistance indication IE is set to "No further uplink or downlink data transmission subsequent to
       the uplink data transmission is expected" in the message;

   -   if the UE has indicated support for the control plane data back-off timer; and

   -   if the MME decides to activate the congestion control for transport of user data via the control plane,

then the MME shall include the T3448 value IE in the SERVICE ACCEPT message.

If the MME sends a SERVICE ACCEPT message and decides to deactivate congestion control for transport of user data
via the control plane then the MME shall delete the stored control plane data back-off time for the UE and the MME
shall not include timer T3448 value IE in SERVICE ACCEPT message.

For cases a, b, c and m in subclause 5.6.1.1, if the EPS bearer context status IE is included in the CONTROL PLANE
SERVICE REQUEST message or the MME needs to initiate an EPS bearer context status synchronization, the MME
shall consider the service request procedure successfully completed when it sends the SERVICE ACCEPT message. If
the EPS bearer context status IE is not included in the CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message and the
MME does not need to initiate an EPS bearer context status synchronization, the MME shall consider the service
request procedure successfully completed in the following cases:

   -   when it successfully completes a NAS security mode control procedure;

   -   when it receives an indication from the lower layer that the user plane is setup, if radio bearer establishment is
       required;

   -   upon receipt of the CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message and completion of the EMM common
       procedures, if any, if the CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message was successfully integrity checked
       and the ESM message container or NAS message container in the CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST
       message, if applicable, was successfully deciphered, radio bearer establishment is not required, and the MME
       has downlink user data or signalling not related to an EMM common procedure pending; and

   -   with the transmission of a SERVICE ACCEPT message or with the decision to initiate release of the NAS
       signalling connection, if the CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message was successfully integrity
       checked and the ESM message container or NAS message container in the CONTROL PLANE SERVICE
       REQUEST message, if applicable, was successfully deciphered, radio bearer establishment is not required, and
       the MME does not have any downlink user data or signalling pending.

If the MME considers the service request procedure successfully completed the MME shall:

   1) forward the contents of the ESM message container IE, if any, to the ESM layer; and

   2) forward the contents of the NAS message container IE, if any.

For cases a, b and c in subclause 5.6.1.1, the UE shall treat the receipt of any of the following as successful completion
of the procedure:

   -   a SECURITY MODE COMMAND message;

   -   a security protected EMM message different from a SERVICE REJECT message and not related to an EMM
       common procedure;

   -   a security protected ESM message; and

   -   receipt of the indication from the lower layers that the user plane radio bearers are set up.

Upon successful completion of the procedure, the UE shall reset the service request attempt counter, stop the timer
T3417 and enter the state EMM-REGISTERED.

   NOTE 4: The security protected EMM message can be e.g. a SERVICE ACCEPT message and the ESM message
           an ESM DATA TRANSPORT message.

For case m in subclause 5.6.1.1, the UE shall treat the indication from the lower layers that the user plane radio bearers
are set up as successful completion of the procedure. The UE shall treat the receipt of a SERVICE ACCEPT message as
completion of the procedure without the establishment of the user plane radio bearers. For both cases, the UE shall reset
the service request attempt counter, stop the timer T3417 and enter the state EMM-REGISTERED.

For case b in subclause 5.6.1.1, the UE shall also treat the indication from the lower layers that the RRC connection has
been released as successful completion of the procedure. The UE shall reset the service request attempt counter, stop the
timer T3417 and enter the state EMM-REGISTERED.

For cases a, c and m in subclause 5.6.1.1, the UE shall treat the indication from the lower layers that the RRC
connection has been released as an abnormal case and shall follow the procedure described in subclause 5.6.1.6, item b.

For cases a, b and c in subclause 5.6.1.1,

   -   if the MME needs to initiate an EPS bearer context status synchronization, the UE can receive a SERVICE
       ACCEPT message even after it received a SECURITY MODE COMMAND message or an indication from the
       lower layers that the user plane radio bearers are set up and determined successful completion of the service
       request procedure. Upon receipt of the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message or an indication from the
       lower layers that the user plane radio bearers are set up, the UE shall start timer T3449. If the UE receives a
       security protected ESM message or a security protected EMM message not related to an EMM common
       procedure, the UE shall stop the timer T3449. If the UE receives a SERVICE ACCEPT message while the timer
       T3449 is running, the UE shall treat the SERVICE ACCEPT message and stop the timer T3449. If the UE is not
       in state EMM-SERVICE-REQUEST-INITIATED and timer T3449 is not running, the receipt of the SERVICE
       ACCEPT message is considered as protocol error and the UE shall return EMM STATUS message as specified
       in subclause 7.4; otherwise the UE shall treat the SERVICE ACCEPT message; and

   -   if the UE treats the SERVICE ACCEPT message and an EPS bearer context status IE is included in the message,
       the UE shall deactivate all those EPS bearers contexts locally (without peer-to-peer signalling between the UE
       and the MME) which are active in the UE, but are indicated by the MME as being inactive. If a default EPS
       bearer context is marked as inactive in the EPS bearer context status IE included in the SERVICE ACCEPT
       message, and this default bearer is not associated with the last remaining PDN connection in the UE, the UE
       shall locally deactivate all EPS bearer contexts associated to the PDN connection with the default EPS bearer
       context without peer-to-peer ESM signalling to the MME. If the default bearer is associated with the last
       remaining PDN connection of the UE in the MME, and EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is

       supported by the UE and the MME, the UE shall locally deactivate all EPS bearer contexts associated to the
       PDN connection with the default EPS bearer context without peer-to-peer ESM signalling to the MME.

If the T3448 value IE is present in the received SERVICE ACCEPT message, the UE shall:

   -   stop timer T3448 if it is running;

   -   consider the transport of user data via the control plane as successful; and

   -   start timer T3448 with the value provided in the T3448 value IE.

If the UE is using EPS services with control plane CIoT EPS optimization, the T3448 value IE is present in the
SERVICE ACCEPT message and the value indicates that this timer is either zero or deactivated, the UE shall consider
this case as an abnormal case and proceed as if the T3448 value IE is not present.

   If the UE in EMM-IDLE mode initiated the service request procedure by sending a CONTROL PLANE SERVICE
       REQUEST message and the SERVICE ACCEPT message does not include the T3448 value IE and if timer
       T3448 is running, then the UE shall stop timer T3448.

5.6.1.5           Service request procedure not accepted by the network
If the service request cannot be accepted, the network shall return a SERVICE REJECT message to the UE including an
appropriate EMM cause value.

   NOTE 1: A service request can only be rejected before the network has initiated any procedure which will be
           interpreted by the UE as successful completion of the service request procedure (see subclauses 5.6.1.4.1
           and 5.6.1.4.2) and which will trigger a transition from state EMM-SERVICE-REQUEST-INITIATED to
           EMM-REGISTERED on the UE side.

Based on local policies or configurations in the MME, if the MME determines to change the periodic tracking area
update timer (T3412), or if the MME determines to change the PSM usage or the value of timer T3324 in the UE for
which PSM is allowed by the MME, the MME may return a SERVICE REJECT with the cause #10 "implicitly
detached" to the UE.

The MME may be configured to perform MME-based access control for mobile originating CS fallback calls for a
certain area A by rejecting related service request with EMM cause #39 "CS service temporarily not available".

   NOTE 2: Dependent on implementation and operator configuration the area A can be configured with the
           granularity of an MME area, tracking area or eNodeB service area.

The MME may further be configured for a certain area A' to exempt service requests for mobile originating CS fallback
calls from this MME-based access control, if:

   -   the service request is initiated in EMM-IDLE mode; and

   -   the UE indicated support of eNodeB-based access control for mobile originating CS fallback calls during an
       attach or tracking area updating procedure.

   NOTE 3: The operator can use this second option when the eNodeBs in area A' are supporting the eNodeB-based
           access control for CS fallback calls. The area A' can be part of area A or the whole area A. It is the
           responsibility of the operator to coordinate the activation of MME-based access control and eNodeB-
           based access control for mobile originating CS fallback calls.

When the EMM cause value is #39 "CS service temporarily not available", the MME shall include a value for timer
T3442 in the SERVICE REJECT message. If a mobile terminating CS fallback call is aborted by the network during
call establishment as specified in 3GPP TS 29.118 [16A], the MME shall include the EMM cause value #39 "CS
service temporarily not available" and set the value of timer T3442 to zero.

If a service request from a UE with only LIPA PDN connections is not accepted due to the reasons specified in
subclause 5.6.1.4, depending on the service request received, the MME shall include the following EMM cause value in
the SERVICE REJECT message:

   -   if the service request received is not due to CS fallback or 1xCS fallback, EMM cause value #10 "implicitly
       detached"; or

   -   if the service request received is due to CS fallback or 1xCS fallback, EMM cause value #40 "no EPS bearer
       context activated".

If a service request from a UE with only remaining SIPTO at the local network PDN connections is not accepted due to
the reasons specified in subclause 5.6.1.4, depending on the service request received, the MME shall:

   -   if the service request received is due to CS fallback or 1xCS fallback, include the EMM cause value #40 "no
       EPS bearer context activated" in the SERVICE REJECT message; or

   -   if the service request received is not due to CS fallback or 1xCS fallback, abort the service request procedure and
       send a DETACH REQUEST message to the UE with detach type "re-attach required" (see subclause 5.5.2.3.1).

If the service request for mobile originated services is rejected due to general NAS level mobility management
congestion control, the network shall set the EMM cause value to #22 "congestion" and assign a value for back-off
timer T3346.

If the service request for mobile originated services is rejected due to service gap control as specified in
subclause 5.3.17 i.e. the T3447 timer is running, the network shall set the EMM cause value to #22 "congestion" and
may assign a back-off timer T3346 with the remaining time of the running T3447 timer.

If the MME sends a SERVICE REJECT message upon receipt of the CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST
message piggybacked with the ESM DATA TRANSPORT message:

   -   if the Release assistance indication IE is not set to "No further uplink or downlink data transmission subsequent
       to the uplink data transmission is expected" in the message;

   -   if the UE has indicated a support for the control plane data back-off timer; and

   -   if the MME decides to activate the congestion control for transport of user data via the control plane,

then the MME shall set the EMM cause value to #22 "congestion" and assign a value for control plane data back-off
timer T3448.

On receipt of the SERVICE REJECT message, if the UE is in state EMM-SERVICE-REQUEST-INITIATED and the
message is integrity protected or contains a reject cause other than EMM cause value #25, the UE shall reset the service
request attempt counter, stop timer T3417, T3417ext or T3417ext-mt, if running.

If the SERVICE REJECT message with EMM cause #25 was received without integrity protection, then the UE shall
discard the message.

The UE shall take the following actions depending on the received EMM cause value in the SERVICE REJECT
message.

   #3 (Illegal UE);

   #6 (Illegal ME); or

   #8 (EPS services and non-EPS services not allowed);

       The UE shall set the EPS update status to EU3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED (and shall store it according to
       subclause 5.1.3.3) and shall delete any GUTI, last visited registered TAI, TAI list and eKSI. The UE shall
       consider the USIM as invalid for EPS services until switching off or the UICC containing the USIM is removed
       or the timer T3245 expires as described in subclause 5.3.7a. The UE shall enter the state EMM-
       DEREGISTERED. If the message has been successfully integrity checked by the NAS and the UE maintains a
       counter for "SIM/USIM considered invalid for GPRS services", then the UE shall set this counter to UE
       implementation-specific maximum value.

       If A/Gb mode or Iu mode is supported by the UE, the UE shall handle the GMM parameters GMM state, GPRS
       update status, P-TMSI, P-TMSI signature, RAI and GPRS ciphering key sequence number and the MM
       parameters update status, TMSI, LAI and ciphering key sequence number as specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 [13]

   #7 (EPS services not allowed);

      The UE shall set the EPS update status to EU3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED (and shall store it according to
      subclause 5.1.3.3) and shall delete any GUTI, last visited registered TAI, TAI list and eKSI. The UE shall
      consider the USIM as invalid for EPS services until switching off or the UICC containing the USIM is removed
      or the timer T3245 expires as described in subclause 5.3.7a. The UE shall enter the state EMM-

      counter for "SIM/USIM considered invalid for GPRS services", then the UE shall set this counter to UE
      implementation-specific maximum value.

      A UE operating in CS/PS mode 1 or CS/PS mode 2 of operation which is already IMSI attached for non-EPS
      services is still IMSI attached for non-EPS services.

      A UE operating in CS/PS mode 1 or CS/PS mode 2 of operation shall set the update status to U2 NOT
      UPDATED, shall attempt to select GERAN or UTRAN radio access technology and proceed with appropriate
      MM specific procedure according to the MM service state. The UE shall not reselect E-UTRAN radio access
      technology until switching off or the UICC containing the USIM is removed.

      If A/Gb mode or Iu mode is supported by the UE, the UE shall handle the GMM parameters GMM state, GPRS
      update status, P-TMSI, P-TMSI signature, RAI and GPRS ciphering key sequence number as specified in

      the state EMM-DEREGISTERED.

      If the service request was initiated for CS fallback and a CS fallback cancellation request was not received, the
      UE shall attempt to select GERAN or UTRAN radio access technology. If the UE finds a suitable GERAN or
      UTRAN cell, it then proceeds with the appropriate MM and CC specific procedures and the EMM sublayer shall
      not indicate the abort of the service request procedure to the MM sublayer. Otherwise the EMM sublayer shall
      indicate the abort of the service request procedure to the MM sublayer.

      If the service request was initiated for 1xCS fallback, the UE shall select cdma2000® 1x radio access

      If the rejected request was not for initiating a PDN connection for emergency bearer services, the UE shall abort
      the service request procedure and enter state EMM-REGISTERED, and stop timer T3417, T3417ext or
      T3417ext-mt if still running.

      The UE shall stop timer T3346 if it is running.

       its value to 2 times the value of T as defined in 3GPP TS 23.122 [6]. While this timer is running, the UE shall
       not consider the PLMN + RAT combination that provided this reject cause as a candidate for PLMN selection.
       The UE then enters state EMM-DEREGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH in order to perform a PLMN selection
       according to 3GPP TS 23.122 [6].

       If A/Gb mode or Iu mode is supported by the UE, the UE shall in addition set the GMM state to GMM-
       DEREGISTERED, GPRS update status to GU2 NOT UPDATED, and shall delete the P-TMSI, P-TMSI
       signature, RAI and GPRS ciphering key sequence number.

Other values are considered as abnormal cases. The specification of the UE behaviour in those cases is described in
subclause 5.6.1.6.

5.6.1.5A         Service request procedure for initiating a PDN connection for emergency
                 bearer services not accepted by the network
If the service request for initiating a PDN connection for emergency bearer services cannot be accepted by the network,
the UE shall perform the procedures as described in subclause 5.6.1.5. Then if the UE is in the same selected PLMN
where the last service request was attempted, the UE shall:

   a) inform the upper layers of the failure of the procedure; or

   NOTE 1: This can result in the upper layers requesting establishment of a CS emergency call (if not already
           attempted in the CS domain) or other implementation specific mechanisms, e.g. procedures specified in
           3GPP TS 24.229 [13D] can result in the emergency call being attempted to another IP-CAN.

   b) detach locally, if not detached already, attempt EPS attach for emergency bearer services.

If the service request for initiating a PDN connection for emergency bearer services fails due to abnormal case a) in
subclause 5.6.1.6, the UE shall perform the actions as described in subclause 5.6.1.6 and inform the upper layers of the
failure to access the network.

5.6.1.6           Abnormal cases in the UE
The following abnormal cases can be identified:

   a) Access barred because of access class barring, EAB, ACDC or NAS signalling connection establishment
      rejected by the network without "Extended wait time" received from lower layers

       In WB-S1 mode, if the service request procedure is started in response to a paging request from the network,
       access class barring, EAB or ACDC is not applicable.

       In NB-S1 mode, if the service request procedure is started in response to a paging request from the network,
       access barring is not applicable.

       If the trigger for the service request procedure is the response to a paging request from the network and the NAS
       signalling connection establishment is rejected by the network, the service request procedure shall not be started.
       The UE stays in the current serving cell and applies normal cell reselection process. During an implementation
       dependent time period, the service request procedure may be started when access for "terminating calls" is
       granted or upon a cell change.

       If the service request was initiated for CS fallback and the access is barred for "mobile originating CS fallback"
       (see 3GPP TS 36.331 [22]) and the lower layer indicates "the barring is due to CSFB specific access barring
       information", the service request procedure shall not be started. The UE stays in the current serving cell and
       applies normal cell reselection process. The service request procedure may be started if it is still necessary, i.e.
       when access for "mobile originating CS fallback" is granted or because of a cell change.

       If the service request was initiated for CS fallback and a CS fallback cancellation request was not received and
       the access is barred for "mobile originating CS fallback" (see 3GPP TS 36.331 [22]) and the lower layer does not
       indicate "the barring is due to CSFB specific access barring information", the UE shall attempt to select GERAN
       or UTRAN radio access technology. If the UE finds a suitable GERAN or UTRAN cell, it then proceeds with the
       appropriate MM and CC specific procedures and the EMM sublayer shall not indicate the abort of the service
       request procedure to the MM sublayer. Otherwise the EMM sublayer shall indicate the abort of the service
       request procedure to the MM sublayer.

       If the service request was initiated for 1xCS fallback and the access is barred for "originating calls" (see
       3GPP TS 36.331 [22]), the UE shall select cdma2000® 1x radio access technology. The UE then proceeds with
       appropriate cdma2000® 1x CS procedures.

       If the lower layer indicated the access was barred because of access class barring for "originating calls" (see
       3GPP TS 36.331 [22]) and if:

       -   the service request is initiated due to a request from upper layers for user plane radio resources, and the MO
           MMTEL voice call is started, the MO MMTEL video call is started or the MO SMSoIP is started;

       -   the service request is initiated due to a mobile originated SMS over NAS or SMS over S102; or

       -   the service request is initiated due to a request from upper layers for user plane radio resources, ACDC is
           applicable to the request and the UE supports ACDC.

       then the service request procedure shall be started. The call type used shall be per annex D of this document.

   NOTE 1: If more than one of MO MMTEL voice call is started, MO MMTEL video call is started or MO SMSoIP
           is started conditions are satisfied, it is left to UE implementation to determine the call type based on
           annex D of this document.

      If access is barred for a certain ACDC category (see 3GPP TS 36.331 [22]), and if the upper layers request user
      plane radio resources for a higher ACDC category and the UE supports ACDC, then the service request
      procedure shall be started.

      If an access request for an uncategorized application is barred due to ACDC (see 3GPP TS 36.331 [22]), and if
      the upper layers request user plane radio resources for a certain ACDC category and the UE supports ACDC,
      then the service request procedure shall be started.

      Otherwise:

      -   In WB-S1 mode, if access is barred for "originating calls" (see 3GPP TS 36.331 [22]), the service request
          procedure shall not be started. The UE stays in the current serving cell and applies normal cell reselection
          process. The service request procedure may be started if it is still necessary when access for "originating
          calls" is granted or because of a cell change.

      -   In NB-S1 mode, if access is barred for "originating calls" (see 3GPP TS 36.331 [22]), the service request
          procedure shall not be started. The UE stays in the current serving cell and applies normal cell reselection
          process. Further UE behaviour is implementation specific, e.g. the service request procedure is started again
          after an implementation dependent time; or

          In NB-S1 mode, if access is barred for "originating calls" (see 3GPP TS 36.331 [22]), and a request for an
          exceptional event is received from the upper layers, then the service request procedure shall be started.

   NOTE 2: In NB-S1 mode, the EMM layer cannot receive the access barring alleviation indication from the lower
           layers (see 3GPP TS 36.331 [22]).

   b) Lower layer failure or release of the NAS signalling connection without "Extended wait time", without
      "Extended wait time CP data", and without redirection indication received from lower layers before the service
      request procedure is completed (see subclause 5.6.1.4) or before SERVICE REJECT message is received

      If the service request was initiated for CS fallback and a CS fallback cancellation request was not received, the
      UE shall attempt to select GERAN or UTRAN radio access technology. If the UE finds a suitable GERAN or
      UTRAN cell, it then proceeds with the appropriate MM and CC specific procedures and the EMM sublayer shall
      not indicate the abort of the service request procedure to the MM sublayer. Otherwise the EMM sublayer shall
      indicate the abort of the service request procedure to the MM sublayer, and the UE shall also set the EPS update
      status to EU2 NOT UPDATED and enter the state EMM-REGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-UPDATE.

      If the service request was initiated for CS fallback and a CS fallback cancellation request was received, the UE
      shall set the EPS update status to EU2 NOT UPDATED and enter the state EMM-
      REGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-UPDATE.

      If the service request was initiated for 1xCS fallback, the UE shall either:

      -   attempt to select cdma2000® 1x radio access technology and proceed with appropriate cdma2000® 1x CS
          procedures. If the UE fails to select cdma2000® 1x radio access technology, the UE shall set the EPS update
          status to EU2 NOT UPDATED and enter the state EMM-REGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-UPDATE; or

      -   set the EPS update status to EU2 NOT UPDATED and enter the state EMM-REGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-
          TO-UPDATE, and perform cell selection according to 3GPP TS 36.304 [21].

      If the service request was not initiated for CS fallback or 1xCS fallback, the UE shall enter state EMM-
      REGISTERED.

      The UE shall abort the service request procedure, stop timer T3417, T3417ext or T3417ext-mt and locally
      release any resources allocated for the service request procedure.

   c) T3417 expired

      The UE shall enter the state EMM-REGISTERED.

      If the UE triggered the service request procedure in EMM-IDLE mode in order to obtain packet services, then
      the EMM sublayer shall increment the service request attempt counter, abort the procedure and release locally

      any resources allocated for the service request procedure. The service request counter shall not be incremented,
      if:

      -   the service request procedure is initiated to establish a PDN connection for emergency bearer services;

      -   the UE has a PDN connection for emergency bearer services established;

      -   the UE is a UE configured to use AC11 – 15 in selected PLMN;

      -   the service request is initiated in response to paging from the network; or

      -   the UE in NB-S1 mode is requested by the upper layer to transmit user data related to an exceptional event
          and the UE is allowed to use exception data reporting (see the ExceptionDataReportingAllowed leaf of the
          NAS configuration MO in 3GPP TS 24.368 [15A] or the USIM file EFNASCONFIG in 3GPP TS 31.102 [17]).

      If the service request attempt counter is greater than or equal to 5, the UE shall start timer T3325 (see
      3GPP TS 24.008 [13]). Additionally if the service request was initiated for an "originating MMTEL voice" call
      type, a notification that the service request was not accepted and that timer T3325 is running shall be provided to
      the upper layers.

   NOTE 3: This can result in the upper layers requesting establishment of a CS voice call (if not already attempted in
           the CS domain), or other implementation specific mechanisms (see 3GPP TS 24.173 [13E]).

      The UE shall not attempt service request until expiry of timer T3325 unless:

      -   the service request is initiated in response to paging from the network;

      -   the UE is a UE configured to use AC11 – 15 in selected PLMN;

      -   the service request is initiated to establish a PDN connection for emergency bearer services;

      -   the UE has a PDN connection for emergency bearer services established;

      -   the UE is registered in a new PLMN; or

      -   the UE in NB-S1 mode is requested by the upper layer to transmit user data related to an exceptional event
          and the UE is allowed to use exception data reporting (see the ExceptionDataReportingAllowed leaf of the
          NAS configuration MO in 3GPP TS 24.368 [15A] or the USIM file EFNASCONFIG in 3GPP TS 31.102 [17]).

      If the service request for "originating MMTEL voice" call type was triggered while T3325 is running, a
      notification that the service request was not accepted and that timer T3325 is running shall be provided to the
      upper layers.

   NOTE 4: This can result in the upper layers requesting establishment of a CS voice call (if not already attempted in
           the CS domain), or other implementation specific mechanisms (see 3GPP TS 24.173 [13E]).

   NOTE 5: The NAS signalling connection can also be released if the UE deems that the network has failed the
           authentication check as specified in subclause 5.4.2.7.

      If the UE triggered the service request procedure in order to obtain services other than packet services from
      EMM-IDLE mode, then the EMM sublayer shall abort the procedure and release locally any resources allocated
      for the service request procedure.

      If the UE triggered the service request procedure in EMM-CONNECTED mode, the EMM sublayer shall abort
      the procedure and consider the service request procedure with "active" flag or the 1xCS fallback procedure as
      failed. The UE shall stay in EMM-CONNECTED mode.

   d) T3417ext or T3417ext-mt expired

      If a CS fallback cancellation request was not received, the UE shall attempt to select GERAN or UTRAN radio
      access technology. If the UE finds a suitable GERAN or UTRAN cell, it then proceeds with the appropriate MM
      and CC specific procedures and the EMM sublayer shall not indicate the abort of the service request procedure
      to the MM sublayer. Otherwise the EMM sublayer shall indicate the abort of the service request procedure to the

              emergency call, the UE shall abort the service request procedure and progress the detach procedure; or

          -   otherwise the UE shall progress both procedures.

   i) Transmission failure of SERVICE REQUEST, CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST or EXTENDED
      SERVICE REQUEST message indication with TAI change from lower layers

      If the current TAI is not in the TAI list, the service request procedure shall be aborted to perform the tracking
      area updating procedure. The "active" flag shall be set in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST
      message. If the service request was initiated for CS fallback or 1xCS fallback, and the CS fallback cancellation
      request was not received, the UE shall send the EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST message to the MME by
      using the existing NAS signalling connection after the completion of the tracking area updating procedure.

      If the current TAI is still part of the TAI list, the UE shall restart the service request procedure.

   j) Transmission failure of SERVICE REQUEST, CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST or EXTENDED
      SERVICE REQUEST message indication without TAI change from lower layers

      The UE shall restart the service request procedure.

   k) Default or dedicated bearer set up failure

      If the lower layers indicate a failure to set up a radio bearer, the UE shall locally deactivate the EPS bearer as
      described in subclause 6.4.4.6.

   l) "Extended wait time" from the lower layers

      The UE shall abort the service request procedure, enter state EMM-REGISTERED, and stop timer T3417,
      T3417ext or T3417ext-mt if still running.

      If the EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST or CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message contained the
      low priority indicator set to "MS is configured for NAS signalling low priority", the UE shall start timer T3346
      with the "Extended wait time" value.

      If the SERVICE REQUEST message was sent by a UE configured for NAS signalling low priority, the UE shall
      start timer T3346 with the "Extended wait time" value.

      If the EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST or CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message did not
      contain the low priority indicator set to "MS is configured for NAS signalling low priority" or if the SERVICE
      REQUEST message was sent by a UE not configured for NAS signalling low priority, the UE is operating in
      NB-S1 mode and the UE is not a UE configured to use AC11 – 15 in selected PLMN, then the UE shall start

      In other cases the UE shall ignore the "Extended wait time".

      The UE stays in the current serving cell and applies normal cell reselection process. The service request

      not received, the UE may attempt to select GERAN or UTRAN radio access technology. It then proceeds with
      appropriate MM and CC specific procedures. The EMM sublayer shall not indicate the abort of the service
      request procedure to the MM sublayer.

      If the service request was initiated for 1xCS fallback, the UE shall select cdma2000® 1x radio access
      technology. The UE then proceeds with appropriate cdma2000® 1x CS procedures.

      If the service request was initiated for 1xCS fallback for emergency call, the UE may select cdma2000® 1x radio
      access technology. The UE then proceeds with appropriate cdma2000® 1x CS procedures.

      If the service request was initiated due to a request from the SMS entity to send an SMS and timer T3246 is not
      running, the UE, if operating in CS/PS mode 1 of operation, may select GERAN or UTRAN radio access
      technology. It then proceeds with the appropriate MM procedure.

   NOTE 6: If the UE disables the E-UTRA capability, then subsequent mobile terminating calls could fail.

   la) "Extended wait time CP data" from the lower layers

      The UE shall abort the service request procedure for transfer of user data via the control plane, enter state EMM-
      REGISTERED, and stop timer T3417 if still running.

      If the UE is operating in NB-S1 mode and supports the timer T3448, the UE shall start the timer T3448 with the
      "Extended wait time CP data" value. If the UE is operating in NB-S1 mode and does not support the timer
      T3448, the UE shall start the timer T3346 with the "Extended wait time CP data" value.

      In other cases the UE shall ignore the "Extended wait time CP data".

      The UE stays in the current serving cell and applies normal cell reselection process. The service request
      procedure for transfer of user data via the control plane is started, if still necessary, when the timer T3448
      expires or is stopped.

   m) Timer T3346 is running

      The UE shall not start the service request procedure unless:

      -   the UE receives a paging;

      -   the UE is a UE configured to use AC11 – 15 in selected PLMN;

      -   the UE has a PDN connection for emergency bearer services established or is establishing a PDN connection
          for emergency bearer services;

      -   the UE is requested by the upper layer for a CS fallback for emergency call or a 1xCS fallback for emergency
          call;

      -   the UE has a PDN connection established without the NAS signalling low priority indication or is
          establishing a PDN connection without the NAS signalling low priority indication and if the timer T3346 was
          started due to rejection of a NAS request message (e.g. ATTACH REQUEST, TRACKING AREA UPDATE
          REQUEST, EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST or CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST) which
          contained the low priority indicator set to "MS is configured for NAS signalling low priority"; or

      -   the UE in NB-S1 mode is requested by the upper layer to transmit user data related to an exceptional event
          and:

          -   the UE is allowed to use exception data reporting (see the ExceptionDataReportingAllowed leaf of the
              NAS configuration MO in 3GPP TS 24.368 [15A] or the USIM file EFNASCONFIG in
              3GPP TS 31.102 [17]); and

          -   timer T3346 was not started when NAS signaling connection was established with RRC establishment
              cause set to "MO exception data".

      If the UE is in EMM-IDLE mode, the UE stays in the current serving cell and applies normal cell reselection
      process. The service request procedure is started, if still necessary, when timer T3346 expires or is stopped.

      Upon upper layer's request for a mobile originated CS fallback which is not for emergency call, the UE in CS/PS
      mode 1 of operation shall attempt to select GERAN or UTRAN radio access technology. If the UE finds a
      suitable GERAN or UTRAN cell, it then proceeds with the appropriate MM and CC specific procedures and the
      EMM sublayer shall not indicate the abort of the service request procedure to the MM sublayer. Otherwise the
      EMM sublayer shall indicate the abort of the service request procedure to the MM sublayer.

   NOTE 7: If the UE disables the E-UTRA capability, then subsequent mobile terminating calls could fail.

      Upon upper layer's request for a CS fallback for emergency call, the UE may select GERAN or UTRAN radio
      access technology. It then proceeds with appropriate MM and CC specific procedures. The EMM sublayer shall
      not indicate the abort of the service request procedure to the MM sublayer.

      Upon a request from the SMS entity to send an SMS and timer T3246 is not running, the UE, if operating in
      CS/PS mode 1 of operation, may select GERAN or UTRAN radio access technology. It then proceeds with the
      appropriate MM procedure.

   NOTE 8: If the UE disables the E-UTRA capability, then subsequent mobile terminating calls could fail.

      Upon upper layer's request for a mobile originated 1x CS fallback which is not for emergency call, the UE shall
      select cdma2000® 1x radio access technology. The UE then proceeds with appropriate cdma2000® 1x CS call
      procedures.

      Upon upper layer's request for a 1xCS fallback for emergency call, the UE may select cdma2000® 1x radio
      access technology. The UE then proceeds with appropriate cdma2000® 1x CS call procedures.

   n) Failure to find a suitable GERAN or UTRAN cell, after release of the NAS signalling connection without
      "Extended wait time" and with redirection indication received from lower layers when the service request was
      initiated for CS fallback

      The EMM sublayer shall indicate the abort of the service request procedure to the MM sublayer, and the UE
      shall also set the EPS update status to EU2 NOT UPDATED and enter the state EMM-
      REGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-UPDATE.

      The UE shall abort the service request procedure, stop timer T3417ext or T3417ext-mt and locally release any
      resources allocated for the service request procedure.

   o) Timer T3448 is running

      The UE in EMM-IDLE mode shall not initiate the service request procedure for transport of user data via the
      control plane unless:

      -   the UE is a UE configured to use AC11 – 15 in selected PLMN;

      -   the UE which is only using EPS services with control plane CIoT EPS optimization received a paging; or

      -   the UE in NB-S1 mode is requested by the upper layer to transmit user data related to an exceptional event
          and the UE is allowed to use exception data reporting (see the ExceptionDataReportingAllowed leaf of the

      The UE stays in the current serving cell and applies the normal cell reselection process.

   p) Timer T3447 is running

      The UE shall not start any service request procedure unless:

      -   the UE receives a paging;

      -   the UE is a UE configured to use AC11 – 15 in selected PLMN;

      -   the UE has a PDN connection for emergency bearer services established or is establishing a PDN connection
          for emergency bearer services.

      The UE stays in the current serving cell and applies the normal cell reselection process. The service request
      procedure is started, if still necessary, when timer T3447 expires.

5.6.1.7          Abnormal cases on the network side
The following abnormal cases can be identified:

   a) Lower layer failure

      If a lower layer failure occurs before a SERVICE REJECT message has been sent to the UE or the service
      request procedure has been completed by the network, the network enters/stays in EMM-IDLE.

   b) Protocol error

      If the SERVICE REQUEST, EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST or the CONTROL PLANE SERVICE
      REQUEST message is received with a protocol error, the network shall return a SERVICE REJECT message
      with one of the following EMM cause values:

      #96:   invalid mandatory information;

      #99:   information element non-existent or not implemented;

      #100: conditional IE error; or

      #111: protocol error, unspecified.

      The network stays in the current EMM mode.

   c) More than one SERVICE REQUEST, EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST or CONTROL PLANE SERVICE
      REQUEST received before the procedure has been completed (i.e., before SERVICE REJECT message has been
      sent or service request procedure has been completed)

      -   If one or more of the information elements in the SERVICE REQUEST message, CONTROL PLANE
          SERVICE REQUEST or EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST for packet services differs from the ones
          received within the previous SERVICE REQUEST, CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST or
          EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST message for packet services, the previously initiated service request
          procedure shall be aborted and the new service request procedure shall be progressed;

   NOTE:     The network actions are implementation dependent for the case that more than one EXTENDED
             SERVICE REQUEST messages for CS fallback or 1xCS fallback are received and their information
             elements differ.

      -   If the information elements do not differ, then the network shall continue with the previous service request
          procedure and shall not treat any further this SERVICE REQUEST, EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST or
          CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message.

   d) ATTACH REQUEST received before a SERVICE REJECT message has been sent or the service request
      procedure has been completed

      If an ATTACH REQUEST message is received and the service request procedure has not been completed or a
      SERVICE REJECT message has not been sent, the network may initiate the EMM common procedures, e.g. the
      EMM authentication procedure. The network may e.g. after a successful EMM authentication procedure
      execution, abort the service request procedure, delete the EMM context, EPS bearer contexts, if any, and
      progress the new ATTACH REQUEST.

   e) TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message received before the service request procedure has been
      completed or a SERVICE REJECT message has been sent

      If a TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message is received and the service request procedure has not
      been completed or a SERVICE REJECT message has not been sent, the network may initiate the EMM common
      procedures, e.g. the EMM authentication procedure. The network may e.g. after a successful EMM

       authentication procedure execution, abort the service request procedure and progress the tracking area updating
       procedure.

   f) Default or dedicated bearer set up failure

       If the lower layers indicate a failure to set up a radio or S1 bearer, the MME shall locally deactivate the EPS
       bearer as described in subclause 6.4.4.6.


5.6.2         Paging procedure

5.6.2.1          General
The paging procedure is used by the network to request the establishment or resumption of a NAS signalling connection
to the UE. Another purpose of the paging procedure is to prompt the UE to reattach if necessary as a result of a network
failure. If the UE is not attached when it receives a paging for EPS services, the UE shall ignore the paging.

Additionally, the network can use the paging procedure to initiate the mobile terminating CS fallback procedure or SMS
or user data transfer via the MME.

5.6.2.2          Paging for EPS services

5.6.2.2.1            Paging for EPS services through E-UTRAN using S-TMSI

5.6.2.2.1.1          General
The network shall initiate the paging procedure for EPS services using S-TMSI with CN domain indicator set to "PS"
when NAS signalling messages, cdma2000® signalling messages or user data is pending to be sent to the UE when no
NAS signalling connection exists (see example in figure 5.6.2.2.1.1).

For the UE using eDRX, the network initiates the paging procedure when NAS signalling messages, cdma2000®
signalling messages or user data is pending to be sent to the UE within the paging time window. If NAS signalling
messages, cdma2000® signalling messages or user data is pending to be sent to the UE outside the paging time window
and the eDRX value that the network provides to the UE in the Extended DRX parameters IE during the last attach
procedure or the last tracking area updating procedure is not all zeros (i.e. the E-UTRAN eDRX cycle length duration is
higher than 5.12 seconds), the network initiates the paging procedure at T time ahead of the beginning of the next
paging time window.

   NOTE 1: T time is a short time period based on implementation. The operator can take possible imperfections in
           the synchronization between the CN and the UE into account when choosing T time.




                               Figure 5.6.2.2.1.1: Paging procedure using S-TMSI

To initiate the procedure the EMM entity in the network requests the lower layer to start paging (see
3GPP TS 36.300 [20], 3GPP TS 36.413 [23]) and shall start the timer:

   -   T3415 for this paging procedure, if the network accepted to use eDRX for the UE and the UE does not have a
       PDN connection for emergency bearer services.




                                                          ETSI
3GPP TS 24.301 version 15.8.0 Release 15                    219                        ETSI TS 124 301 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


   -   Otherwise, T3413 for this paging procedure.

If the network starts timer T3415, the network shall set timer T3415 to a value smaller than the value of timer T3-
RESPONSE (see 3GPP TS 29.274 [16D] for further details on timer T3-RESPONSE).

The EMM entity may provide the lower layer with a list of CSG IDs, including the CSG IDs of both the expired and the
not expired subscriptions. If there is a PDN connection for emergency bearer services established, the EMM entity in
the network shall not provide the list of CSG IDs to the lower layer.

Upon reception of a paging indication, if control plane CIoT EPS optimization is not used by the UE, the UE shall stop
the timer T3346, if running, and shall initiate:

   -   a service request procedure to respond to the paging (see 3GPP TS 23.401 [10] and 3GPP TS 36.413 [23]); or

   -   a tracking area update procedure as specified in subclauses 5.5.3.2.2 and 5.5.3.3.2.

and additionally if the UE is in the EMM-IDLE mode with suspend indication, resume the suspended NAS signalling
connection to the MME as specified in subclause 5.3.1.3.

Upon reception of a paging indication, if control plane CIoT EPS optimization is used by the UE, the UE shall stop the
timer T3346, if running, and shall additionally:

   -   initiate a service request procedure as specified in subclause 5.6.1.2.2 if the UE is in the EMM-IDLE mode
       without suspend indication;

   -   initiate a tracking area update procedure as specified in subclauses 5.5.3.2.2; or

   -   proceed the behaviour as specified in subclause 5.3.1.3 if the UE is in the EMM-IDLE mode with suspend
       indication.

   NOTE 2: If the UE is in the EMM-IDLE mode without suspend indication and has an uplink user data to be sent to
           the network using control plane CIoT EPS optimization when receiving the paging indication, the UE can
           piggyback the uplink user data during the service request procedure initiated to respond to the paging, as
           specified in subclause 5.6.1.2.2.

If the paging for EPS services was received during an ongoing UE-initiated EMM specific procedure or service request
procedure, then the UE shall ignore the paging. The network shall proceed with the EMM specific procedure or the
service request procedure, and stop the timer for the paging procedure (i.e. either timer T3413 or timer T3415). If the
network receives an ATTACH REQUEST message when the paging procedure is ongoing, it should be considered as
an abnormal case, and the behaviour of the network for this case is specified in subclause 5.6.2.2.1.2.

The network shall stop the timer for the paging procedure (i.e. either timer T3413 or timer T3415) when an integrity-
protected response is received from the UE and successfully integrity checked by the network or when the EMM entity
in the MME receives an indication from the lower layer that it has received the S1-AP UE context resume request
message as specified in 3GPP TS 36.413 [23]. If the response received is not integrity protected, or the integrity check
is unsuccessful, the timer for the paging procedure (i.e. either timer T3413 or timer T3415) shall be kept running unless:

   -   the UE has a PDN connection for emergency bearer services; or

   -   the response received is a TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message and the security mode control
       procedure or authentication procedure performed during tracking area update procedure has completed
       successfully.

Upon expiry of timer T3413, the network may reinitiate paging.

If the network, while waiting for a response to the paging sent without paging priority, receives downlink signalling or
downlink data associated with priority EPS bearers, the network shall stop the timer for the paging procedure (i.e. either
timer T3413 or timer T3415), and then initiate the paging procedure with paging priority.

Upon expiry of timer T3415, the network shall abort the paging procedure and shall proceed as specified in
3GPP TS 23.401 [10].

5.6.2.2.1.2          Abnormal cases on the network side
The following abnormal case can be identified:

   a) ATTACH REQUEST message received when paging procedure is ongoing.

       If an integrity-protected ATTACH REQUEST message is received from the UE and successfully integrity
       checked by the network, the network shall abort the paging procedure. If the ATTACH REQUEST message
       received is not integrity protected, or the integrity check is unsuccessful, the paging procedure shall be
       progressed.The paging procedure shall be aborted when the EPS authentication procedure performed during
       attach procedure is completed successfully.

5.6.2.2.2            Paging for EPS services through E-UTRAN using IMSI
Paging for EPS services using IMSI is an abnormal procedure used for error recovery in the network.

The network may initiate paging for EPS services using IMSI with CN domain indicator set to "PS" if the S-TMSI is
not available due to a network failure (see example in figure 5.6.2.2.2.1).




                                Figure 5.6.2.2.2.1: Paging procedure using IMSI

In S1 mode, to initiate the procedure the EMM entity in the network requests the lower layer to start paging. If the TAI
list is not available due to a network failure, the network may perform the paging within all tracking areas served by the
MME (see 3GPP TS 36.331 [22] and 3GPP TS 36.413 [23]).

When a UE receives a paging for EPS services using IMSI from the network before a UE initiated EMM specific
procedure has been completed, then the UE shall abort the EMM specific procedure and proceed according to the
description in this subclause.

Upon reception of a paging for EPS services using IMSI, the UE shall stop timer T3346, if it is running, locally
deactivate any EPS bearer context(s), if any, and locally detach from EPS. Additionally the UE shall delete the
following parameters: last visited registered TAI, TAI list, GUTI and KSIASME. The UE shall set the EPS update status
to EU2 NOT UPDATED and change the state to EMM-DEREGISTERED. The UE shall stop all timers T3396 that are
running.

If A/Gb mode or Iu mode is supported by the UE, the UE shall in addition handle the GMM parameters GMM state,
GPRS update status, P-TMSI, P-TMSI signature, RAI, and GPRS ciphering key sequence number as specified in
3GPP TS 24.008 [13] for the case when a paging for GPRS services using IMSI is received.

After performing the local detach, the UE shall then perform an attach procedure as described in subclause 5.5.1.2. If
the UE is operating in CS/PS mode 1 or CS/PS mode 2 of operation, then the UE shall perform a combined attach
procedure as described in subclause 5.5.1.3.

   NOTE 1: In some cases, user interaction can be required, thus the UE cannot activate the dedicated bearer
           context(s), if any, automatically.

   NOTE 2: The UE does not respond to the paging except with the ATTACH REQUEST message, hence timers
           T3413 and T3415 in the network are not used when paging with IMSI.

5.6.2.3          Paging for CS fallback to A/Gb or Iu mode

5.6.2.3.1            General
The network may initiate the paging procedure for CS fallback when the UE is IMSI attached for non-EPS services (see
example in figure 5.6.2.3.1.1).




                 Figure 5.6.2.3.1.1: Paging procedure for CS fallback to A/Gb or Iu mode

To initiate the procedure when no NAS signalling connection exists, the EMM entity in the network requests the lower
layer to start paging (see 3GPP TS 36.300 [20], 3GPP TS 36.413 [23]). The EMM entity may provide the lower layer
with a list of CSG IDs, including the CSG IDs of both the expired and the not expired subscriptions. If there is a PDN
connection for emergency bearer services established, the EMM entity in the network shall not provide the list of CSG
IDs to the lower layer. The paging message includes a UE Paging Identity set to either the UE's S-TMSI or the UE's
IMSI, and a CN domain indicator set to "CS" in order to indicate that this is paging for CS fallback.

   NOTE:      The timers T3413 and T3415 are not started in the network when the paging procedure is initiated for CS
              fallback.

To notify the UE about an incoming mobile terminating CS service excluding SMS over SGs when a NAS signalling
connection exists, the EMM entity in the network shall send a CS SERVICE NOTIFICATION message. This message
may also include CS service related parameters (e.g. Calling Line Identification, SS or LCS related parameters).

Upon reception of a paging indication, a UE that is IMSI attached for non-EPS services shall initiate a service request
procedure or combined tracking area update procedure as specified in subclause 5.5.3.3.2. If the paging is received in
EMM-IDLE mode, the UE shall respond immediately. If the paging is received as a CS SERVICE NOTIFICATION
message in EMM-CONNECTED mode, the UE may request upper layers input i.e. to accept or reject CS fallback
before responding with an EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST. The response is indicated in the CSFB response
information element in the EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST message in both EMM-IDLE and EMM-CONNECTED
modes.

5.6.2.3.2            Abnormal cases in the UE
A UE that requested "SMS only" in the combined attach procedure or combined tracking area updating procedure may
ignore the CS SERVICE NOTIFICATION message or the paging indication with the CN domain indicator set to "CS".

5.6.2.3.3            Abnormal cases on the network side
The following abnormal case can be identified:

   a) Void

   b) ATTACH REQUEST message received when paging procedure is ongoing.

       If an integrity-protected ATTACH REQUEST message is received from the UE and successfully integrity
       checked by the network, the network shall abort the paging procedure. If the ATTACH REQUEST message
       received is not integrity protected, or the integrity check is unsuccessful, the paging procedure shall be
       progressed.The paging procedure shall be aborted when the EPS authentication procedure performed during
       attach procedure is completed successfully.

   c) TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message received in response to a CS SERVICE NOTIFICATION
      message

       If the network receives a TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message in response to a CS SERVICE
       NOTIFICATION message, the network shall progress the tracking area updating procedure.

   NOTE:      After completion of the tracking area updating procedure the UE can accept or reject the CS fallback by
              sending an EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST message.

   d) DETACH REQUEST message received in response to a CS SERVICE NOTIFICATION message

       If the network receives a DETACH REQUEST message with detach type "IMSI detach" or "combined
       EPS/IMSI detach" in response to a CS SERVICE NOTIFICATION message, the network shall progress the
       detach procedure.

5.6.2.4          Paging for SMS
The network shall initiate the paging procedure when it receives an incoming mobile terminating SMS to the UE if the
UE is:

   -   IMSI attached for non-EPS services or for "SMS only"; or

   -   attached for EPS services with CIoT EPS optimization and the UE has requested "SMS only" and the UE is in
       NB-S1 mode,

and no NAS signalling connection exists.

For the UE using eDRX, the network initiates the paging procedure when an incoming mobile terminating SMS is
received within the paging time window. If an incoming mobile terminating SMS is received outside the paging time
window and the eDRX value that the network provides to the UE in the Extended DRX parameters IE during the last
attach procedure or the last tracking area updating procedure is not all zeros (i.e. the E-UTRAN eDRX cycle length
duration is higher than 5.12 seconds), the network initiates the paging procedure at T time ahead of the beginning of the
next paging time window.

   NOTE:      T time is a short time period based on implementation. The operator can take possible imperfections in
              the synchronization between the CN and the UE into account when choosing T time.

To initiate the procedure for SMS when no NAS signalling connection exists, the EMM entity in the network requests
the lower layer to start paging (see 3GPP TS 36.413 [23]). The paging message shall include a CN domain indicator set
to "PS". If the paging message includes a UE Paging Identity set to the UE's S-TMSI, the paging procedure is
performed according to subclause 5.6.2.2.1. If the paging message includes a UE Paging Identity set to the UE's IMSI,
the paging procedure is performed according to subclause 5.6.2.2.2. The MME shall not start timers T3413 and T3415
for this procedure.


5.6.3         Transport of NAS messages procedure

5.6.3.1          General
The purpose of the transport of NAS messages procedure is to carry SMS messages in an encapsulated form between
the MME and the UE. The procedure may be initiated by the UE or the network and can only be used when the UE is
attached for EPS services and non-EPS services or for EPS services and "SMS only", and the UE is in EMM-
CONNECTED mode.

   NOTE 1: If the UE is in EMM-IDLE mode and is using EPS services with control plane CIoT EPS optimization,
           the UE transports the first SMS message by encapsulating it in the NAS message container IE in the
           Control Plane Service Request message.

   NOTE 2: When the UE is using EPS services with control plane CIoT EPS optimization, the network can initiate
           downlink transport of NAS messages procedure even if the UE does not have any PDN connections
           established.

5.6.3.2           UE initiated transport of NAS messages
Upon request from the SMS entity to send an SMS message, the EMM entity in the UE initiates the procedure by
sending an UPLINK NAS TRANSPORT message including the SMS message in the NAS message container IE.

   NOTE:      When the UE is using for EPS services with control plane CIoT EPS optimization, the UE can initiate
              uplink transport of NAS messages procedure even if the UE does not any PDN connections established.

5.6.3.3           Network initiated transport of NAS messages
The network initiates the procedure by sending a DOWNLINK NAS TRANSPORT message. When receiving the
DOWNLINK NAS TRANSPORT message, the EMM entity in the UE shall forward the contents of the NAS message
container IE to the SMS entity.

   NOTE:      When the UE is using for EPS services with control plane CIoT EPS optimization, the network can
              initiate downlink transport of NAS messages procedure even if the UE does not any PDN connections
              established.

5.6.3.4           Abnormal cases in the UE
The following abnormal case can be identified:

   a) Timer T3346 is running

       The UE shall not send an UPLINK NAS TRANSPORT message unless:

       -   the UE is a UE configured to use AC11 – 15 in selected PLMN;

       -   the UE has a PDN connection for emergency bearer services established; or

       -   the UE is configured for dual priority and has a PDN connection established without low access priority but
           the timer T3346 was started in response to NAS signalling request with low access priority.

   -   The UPLINK NAS TRANSPORT message can be sent, if still necessary, when timer T3346 expires or is
       stopped.

   b) Timer T3447 is running

       The UE shall not send an UPLINK NAS TRANSPORT message when the UE is in EMM-CONNECTED mode
       after the UE attached without PDN connection, unless:

       -   the UE is a UE configured to use AC11 – 15 in the selected PLMN; or

       -   a network initiated signaling message has been received.

       The UPLINK NAS TRANSPORT message can be sent, if still necessary, when timer T3447 expires.

5.6.3.5           Abnormal cases on the network side
The following abnormal case can be identified:

   a) Lower layer indication of non-delivered NAS PDU

       If the DOWNLINK NAS TRANSPORT message is not delivered for any reason, the MME may discard the
       message.


5.6.4         Generic transport of NAS messages procedure

5.6.4.1           General
The purpose of the generic transport of NAS messages procedure is to carry protocol messages from various
applications (e.g., an LCS application to send an LPP message or a location service message) in an encapsulated form

between the MME and the UE. The procedure may be initiated by the UE or the network and can only be used when the
UE is attached for EPS services and is in EMM-CONNECTED mode.

5.6.4.2           UE initiated generic transport of NAS messages
Upon request from an application to send a message encapsulated in the generic transport of NAS message, the EMM
entity in the UE initiates the procedure by sending an UPLINK GENERIC NAS TRANSPORT message including the
corresponding message in the generic message container IE. The application may also request additional information to
be included in the UPLINK GENERIC NAS TRANSPORT message in the Additional information IE. The content,
coding and interpretation of this information element are dependent on the particular application.

The UE shall indicate the application protocol using the generic transport in the corresponding generic message
container type. When receiving the UPLINK GENERIC NAS TRANSPORT message, the EMM entity in the MME
shall provide the contents of the generic message container IE and the generic message container type IE to the
corresponding application. If included, the EMM entity in the MME shall also provide the contents of the Additional
information IE.

5.6.4.3           Network initiated transport of NAS messages
Upon request from an application to send a message encapsulated in the generic transport of NAS message, the EMM
entity in the MME initiates the procedure by sending a DOWNLINK GENERIC NAS TRANSPORT message including
the corresponding message in the generic message container IE. The application may also request additional
information to be included in the DOWNLINK GENERIC NAS TRANSPORT message in the Additional information
IE. The content, coding and interpretation of this information element are dependent on the particular application.

The MME shall indicate the application protocol using the generic transport in the corresponding generic message
container type. When receiving the DOWNLINK GENERIC NAS TRANSPORT message, the EMM entity in the UE
shall provide the contents of the generic message container IE and the generic message container type IE to the
corresponding application. If included, the EMM entity in the UE shall also provide the contents of the Additional
information IE.

5.6.4.4           Abnormal cases in the UE
The following abnormal case can be identified:

   a) Timer T3346 is running

       The UE shall not send an UPLINK GENERIC NAS TRANSPORT message unless:

           the UE is a UE configured to use AC11 – 15 in selected PLMN;

       -   the UE has a PDN connection for emergency bearer services established; or

           the UE is configured for dual priority and has a PDN connection established without low access priority but
           the timer T3346 was started in response to NAS signalling request with low access priority.

   -   The UPLINK GENERIC NAS TRANSPORT message can be sent, if still necessary, when timer T3346 expires
       or is stopped.

5.6.4.5           Abnormal cases on the network side
The following abnormal case can be identified:

   a) Lower layer indication of non-delivered NAS PDU

       If the DOWNLINK GENERIC NAS TRANSPORT message is not delivered for any reason, the MME may
       discard the message.

5.7            Reception of an EMM STATUS message by an EMM entity
The purpose of the sending of the EMM STATUS message is to report at any time certain error conditions detected
upon receipt of EMM protocol data. The EMM STATUS message can be sent by both the MME and the UE (see
example in figure 5.7.1).

On receipt of an EMM STATUS message no state transition and no specific action shall be taken as seen from the radio
interface, i.e. local actions are possible. The local actions to be taken by the MME or the UE on receipt of an EMM
STATUS message are implementation dependent.

6              Elementary procedures for EPS session
               management

6.1            Overview
6.1.1          General
This clause describes the procedures used for EPS session management (ESM) at the radio interface (reference point
"LTE-Uu").

The main function of the ESM sublayer is to support the EPS bearer context handling in the UE and in the MME.

The ESM comprises procedures for:

    -   the activation, deactivation and modification of EPS bearer contexts;

    -   the request for resources (IP connectivity to a PDN or dedicated bearer resources) by the UE; and

    -   the transport of user data via the control plane between the UE and the MME.

Each EPS bearer context represents an EPS bearer between the UE and a PDN. EPS bearer contexts can remain
activated even if the radio and S1 bearers constituting the corresponding EPS bearers between UE and MME are
temporarily released.

An EPS bearer context can be either a default bearer context or a dedicated bearer context.

A default EPS bearer context is activated when the UE requests a connection to a PDN.

Generally, ESM procedures can be performed only if an EMM context has been established between the UE and the
MME, and the secure exchange of NAS messages has been initiated by the MME by use of the EMM procedures
described in clause 5. The first default EPS bearer context, however, can be activated during the EPS attach procedure
(see subclause 4.2). Once the UE is successfully attached, and the first default EPS bearer context has been activated
during or after the attach procedure, the UE can request the MME to set up connections to additional PDNs. For each




                                                          ETSI
3GPP TS 24.301 version 15.8.0 Release 15                    226                       ETSI TS 124 301 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


additional connection, the MME will activate a separate default EPS bearer context. A default EPS bearer context
remains activated throughout the lifetime of the connection to the PDN.

A dedicated EPS bearer context is always linked to a default EPS bearer context and represents additional EPS bearer
resources between the UE and the PDN. The network can initiate the activation of dedicated EPS bearer contexts
together with the activation of the default EPS bearer context or at any time later, as long as the default EPS bearer
context remains activated. However, the network shall not initiate a dedicated bearer context activation procedure for
established PDN connection(s) of "non IP" PDN type.

Default and dedicated EPS bearer contexts can be modified. Dedicated EPS bearer contexts can be released without
affecting the default EPS bearer context. When the default EPS bearer context is released, then all dedicated EPS bearer
contexts linked to it are released too.

The UE can request the network to allocate, modify or release EPS bearer resources. The network can fulfil such a
request from the UE by activating a new dedicated EPS bearer context, modifying an EPS bearer context or deactivating
an EPS bearer context.


6.1.2         Types of ESM procedures
Two types of ESM procedures can be distinguished:

   1) Procedures related to EPS bearer contexts:

       These procedures are initiated by the network and are used for the manipulation of EPS bearer contexts:

       -   default EPS bearer context activation;

       -   dedicated EPS bearer context activation;

       -   EPS bearer context modification;

       -   EPS bearer context deactivation.

       This procedure is initiated by the network or by the UE and is used for the transport of user data via the control
       plane:

       -   transport of user data via the control plane procedure.

   2) Transaction related procedures:

       These procedures are initiated by the UE to request for resources, i.e. a new PDN connection or dedicated bearer
       resources, or to release these resources:

       -   PDN connectivity procedure;

       -   PDN disconnect procedure;

       -   bearer resource allocation procedure;

       -   bearer resource modification procedure.

       This procedure is initiated by the ProSe UE-to-network relay and is used for the manipulation of EPS bearer
       contexts:

       -   remote UE report.

       When combined with the attach procedure, the PDN connectivity procedure can trigger the network to execute
       the following transaction related procedure:

       -   ESM information request procedure.

       When combined with the attach procedure, if EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is supported by the
       UE and the network and no PDN connectivity procedure is initiated during the attach procedure, the UE or the
       network executes the following transaction related procedure:

       -   ESM dummy message procedure.



                                                           ETSI
3GPP TS 24.301 version 15.8.0 Release 15                   227                       ETSI TS 124 301 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


A successful transaction related procedure initiated by the UE triggers the network to execute one of the procedures
related to EPS bearer contexts. The UE treats the start of the procedure related to the EPS bearer context as completion
of the transaction related procedure.

During procedures related to EPS bearer contexts, the MME and the UE shall not initiate the transport of user data via
the control plane procedure until the ongoing procedure is completed.

   NOTE 1: The UE determination of the completion of the transport of user data via the control plane procedure is
           left to the implementation.

   NOTE 2: NAS signalling prioritization with respect to the transport of user data via the control plane cannot be
           guaranteed in the downlink direction in this version of the specification.

Except for the remote UE report procedure and ESM information request procedure, during transaction related
procedures, the MME and the UE shall not initiate the transport of user data via the control plane procedure until the
ongoing procedure is completed.

The following ESM procedures can be related to an EPS bearer context or to a procedure transaction:

   -   ESM status procedure;

   -   notification procedure.

For inter-system change from S1 mode to A/Gb mode or Iu mode, SM uses the following parameters from each active
EPS bearer context:

   -   EPS bearer identity to map to NSAPI;

   NOTE 1: If the UE and the MME support signalling for a maximum number of 15 EPS bearer contexts, any active
           EPS bearer contexts using EPS bearer identity 1 to 4 are not mapped but deactivated locally before inter-
           system change to A/Gb mode or Iu mode.

   -   linked EPS bearer identity (if available) to map to linked TI;




                                                                         ETSI
3GPP TS 24.301 version 15.8.0 Release 15                   230                       ETSI TS 124 301 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


   -   PDN address and APN of the default EPS bearer context to map to PDP address and APN of the default PDP
       context;

   -   TFT of the default EPS bearer context, if any, to map to the TFT of the default PDP context;

   -   TFTs of the dedicated EPS bearer contexts to map to TFTs of the secondary PDP contexts; and

   -   GERAN/UTRAN parameters as provided by the MME while on E-UTRAN access, i.e. R99 QoS, LLC SAPI,
       radio priority, packet flow identifier, transaction identifier and BCM (if available). If the MME also provided an
       Extended EPS QoS IE, then the bit rates signalled with this IE are also applicable to the R99 QoS.

   NOTE 2: Some networks not supporting mobility from S1 mode to A/Gb mode or Iu mode or both do not provide
           the UE with the GERAN/UTRAN parameters. However, for this case there is no need for the UE to
           perform mapping to GERAN/UTRAN parameters (i.e. the PDP contexts cannot be transferred to A/Gb
           mode or Iu mode).

The MME performs the mapping from EPS to R99 QoS parameters according to 3GPP TS 23.401 [10], annex E.

At inter-system change from S1 mode to A/Gb mode, SM shall not activate the PDP context(s) if SM does not have the
following parameters from the active EPS bearer context(s):

   -   LLC SAPI;

   -   radio priority;

   -   transaction identifier; and

   -   R99 QoS.

At inter-system change from S1 mode to Iu mode, SM shall not activate the PDP context(s) if SM does not have the
following parameter from the active EPS bearer context(s):

   -   transaction identifier; and

   -   R99 QoS.

For inter-system change from A/Gb mode or Iu mode to S1 mode, ESM uses the following parameters from each active
PDP context:

   -   NSAPI to map to EPS bearer identity;

   -   NSAPI of the default PDP context to map to linked EPS bearer identity;

   -   PDP address and APN of the default PDP context to map to PDN address and APN of the default EPS bearer
       context;

   -   TFT of the default PDP context, if any, to map to the TFT of the default EPS bearer context; and

   -   TFTs of the secondary PDP contexts to map to the TFTs of the dedicated EPS bearer contexts.

The MME and the UE perform the mapping from R99 to EPS QoS parameters according to 3GPP TS 23.401 [10],
annex E. In particular the MME derives the APN-AMBR for the corresponding PDN connection from the MBR of the
R99 subscribed QoS profile and the UE maps the MBR of its default PDP context to the APN-AMBR of the
corresponding PDN connection.

6.1.4A            Coordination between ESM and 5GSM
See subclause 6.1.4 in 3GPP TS 24.501 [54].


6.1.5         Coordination between ESM and EMM for supporting ISR
The UE with its TIN set as "RAT-related TMSI" for which ISR is activated shall change its TIN to "GUTI" to locally
deactivate ISR and stop the periodic routing area update timer T3312 or T3323, if running:

   -   upon modification of any EPS bearer context which was activated before the ISR is activated in the UE;




                                                          ETSI
3GPP TS 24.301 version 15.8.0 Release 15                   231                       ETSI TS 124 301 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


   -   at the time when the UE changes from S1 mode to A/Gb mode or Iu mode not due to PS handover procedure
       (see 3GPP TS 24.008 [13]), if any EPS bearer context activated after the ISR was activated in the UE exists; or

   -   upon deactivation of the last non-emergency EPS bearer context in the UE, if the UE has only a PDN connection
       for emergency bearer services remaining.

ISR remains activated on the network side in the above cases.


6.2           IP address allocation
6.2.1         General
The UE can configure an IPv4 address during the establishment of a default EPS bearer context. The UE can obtain an
IPv4 address or an IPv6 prefix or both via an IETF-based IP address allocation mechanism once the default bearer is
established.

The following IETF-based IP address/prefix allocation methods are specified for EPS (the corresponding procedures are
specified in 3GPP TS 29.061 [16]):

   a) /64 IPv6 default prefix allocation via IPv6 stateless address autoconfiguration. Optionally, allocation of
      additional IPv6 prefix(es) with length /64 or shorter via stateful DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation (see
      IETF RFC 3633 [24A]);

   b) IPv4 address allocation and IPv4 parameter configuration via DHCPv4;

   c) IPv6 parameter configuration via stateless DHCPv6.

   NOTE:      From the perspective of the UE, the procedure used to allocate a static IP address via NAS signalling is
              the same as the procedure used to allocate a dynamic IP address specified in subclause 6.2.2.

Upon deactivation of the default bearer of a PDN connection, the UE shall locally release any IPv4 address or IPv6
prefix allocated to the UE for the corresponding PDN connection.


6.2.2         IP address allocation via NAS signalling
The UE shall set the PDN type IE in the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message, based on its IP stack
configuration if it requests IP connectivity (e.g. the per APN settings specified in 3GPP TS 23.401 [10]) as follows:

   a)- A UE, which is IPv6 and IPv4 capable and

       -   has not been allocated an IP address for this APN, shall set the PDN type IE to IPv4v6.

       -   has been allocated an IPv4 address for this APN and received the ESM cause #52 "single address bearers
           only allowed", and is requesting an IPv6 address, shall set the PDN type IE to IPv6.

       -   has been allocated an IPv6 address for this APN and received the ESM cause #52 "single address bearers
           only allowed", and is requesting an IPv4 address, shall set the PDN type IE to IPv4.

   b) A UE, which is only IPv4 capable, shall set the PDN type IE to IPv4.

   c) A UE, which is only IPv6 capable, shall set the PDN type IE to IPv6.

   d) When the IP version capability of the UE is unknown in the UE (as in the case when the MT and TE are
      separated and the capability of the TE is not known in the MT), the UE shall set the PDN type IE to IPv4v6.

If the UE wants to use DHCPv4 for IPv4 address assignment, it shall indicate that to the network within the Protocol
Configuration Options IE in the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST.

If the UE wants to get PDN connectivity without IP, the UE shall set the PDN type IE in the PDN CONNECTIVITY
REQUEST message to "non IP".

3GPP TS 24.301 version 15.8.0 Release 15                  232                        ETSI TS 124 301 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


On receipt of the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message sent by the UE, the network when allocating an IP
address shall take into account the PDN type IE, the operator policies of the home and visited network, and the user's
subscription data and:

   -   if the UE requests for PDN type IPv4v6, but the subscription is limited to IPv4 only or IPv6 only for the
       requested APN, the network shall override the PDN type requested by the UE to be limited to a single address
       PDN type (IPv4 or IPv6). In the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message sent to
       the UE, the network shall set the PDN type value to either "IPv4" or "IPv6" and the ESM cause value to #50
       "PDN type IPv4 only allowed", or #51 "PDN type IPv6 only allowed", respectively. The UE shall not
       subsequently initiate another UE requested PDN connectivity procedure to the same APN to obtain a PDN type
       different from the one allowed by the network until:

       a) all EPS bearer contexts to the given APN are deactivated at the UE as a result of:

          i) EPS bearer context synchronization during tracking area updating or service request procedure;

          ii) an EPS bearer context deactivation procedure initiated by the network;

          iii) a local EPS bearer context deactivation without NAS signalling as specified in subclause 6.4.4.6;

          iv) a detach procedure; or

          v) a tracking area updating procedure or service request procedure that is rejected with a cause which results
             in the UE entering state EMM-DEREGISTERED;

       b) the PDN type which is used to access to the APN is changed;

   NOTE 1: Request to send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message with a specific PDN type has to
           come from upper layers.

   -   if the UE requests PDN type IPv4v6, but the PDN GW configuration dictates the use of IPv4 addressing only or
       IPv6 addressing only for this APN, the network shall override the PDN type requested by the UE to limit it to a
       single address PDN type (IPv4 or IPv6). In the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST
       message sent to the UE, the network shall set the PDN type value to either "IPv4" or "IPv6" and the ESM cause
       value to #50 "PDN type IPv4 only allowed", or #51 "PDN type IPv6 only allowed", respectively. The UE shall
       not subsequently initiate another UE requested PDN connectivity procedure to the same APN to obtain a PDN
       type different from the one allowed by the network until:

       a) all EPS bearer contexs to the given APN are deactivated at the UE and the network as a result of:

          i) EPS bearer context synchronization during tracking area updating or service request procedure;

          ii) an EPS bearer context deactivation procedure initiated by the network;

          iii) a local EPS bearer context deactivation without NAS signalling as specified in subclause 6.4.4.6;

          iv) a detach procedure; or

          v) a tracking area updating procedure or service request procedure that is rejected with a cause which results
             in the UE entering state EMM-DEREGISTERED ;

       b) the PDN type which is used to access to the APN is changed;

   NOTE 2: Request to send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message with a specific PDN type has to
           come from upper layers.

   -   if the UE requests PDN type IPv4v6, but the operator uses single addressing per bearer, e.g. due to interworking
       with nodes of earlier releases, the network shall override the PDN type requested by the UE to a single IP
       version only. In the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message sent to the UE, the
       network shall set the PDN type value to either "IPv4" or "IPv6" and the ESM cause value to #52 "single address
       bearers only allowed". The UE should subsequently request another PDN connection for the other IP version
       using the UE requested PDN connectivity procedure to the same APN with a single address PDN type (IPv4 or
       IPv6) other than the one already activated;

   NOTE 3: If the MT and TE are separated, the UE might not be able to use ESM cause #52 "single address bearers
           only allowed" as a trigger for activating a second single-IP-stack EPS bearer context.

   -   if the network sets the PDN type to IPv4 or IPv4v6, the network shall include an IPv4 address in the PDN
       address information. In this case, if the IPv4 address is to be configured using DHCPv4, the network shall set the
       IPv4 address to 0.0.0.0; and

   -   if the network sets the PDN type to IPv6 or IPv4v6, the network shall include the interface identifier that the UE
       shall use for the link local address in the PDN address information.

The network shall include the PDN type and the PDN address information within the PDN address IE in the
ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message sent to the UE.


6.2A          IP header compression
The UE and the MME may support robust header compression (ROHC) framework (see IETF RFC 5795 [37]) for IP
header compression if control plane CIoT EPS optimization is supported for PDN connections of IP PDN type. If IP
header compression for control plane CIoT EPS optimization is supported, the ROHC profiles defined in
3GPP TS 36.323 [38] may be supported. The ROHC configuration is negotiated and established during the UE
requested PDN connectivity procedure as specified in subclause 6.5.1. Both the UE and the MME indicate whether IP
header compression for control plane CIoT EPS optimization is supported during attach and tracking area updating
procedures (see subclauses 5.5.1 and 5.5.3). The ROHC configuration can be re-negotiated by using the UE requested
bearer resource modification procedure or the EPS bearer context modification procedure as specified in
subclauses 6.4.3 and 6.5.4.


6.3           General on elementary ESM procedures
6.3.1         Services provided by lower layers
Unless explicitly stated otherwise, the procedures described in the following subclauses can only be executed whilst a
NAS signalling exists between the UE and the MME.


6.3.2         Principles of address handling for ESM procedures
Transaction related procedures use the procedure transaction identity as address parameter in the ESM message header.
When the UE or the network initiates a transaction related procedure, it shall include a valid procedure transaction
identity value in the message header and set the EPS bearer identity to "no EPS bearer identity assigned". When the
ProSe UE-to-network relay initiates the transaction related procedure remote UE report, it shall include a valid
procedure transaction identity value in the message header and set the EPS bearer identity to a valid EPS bearer identity
value.

If the response message is again a transaction related message, e.g. a PDN CONNECTIVITY REJECT, PDN
DISCONNECT REJECT, BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REJECT, BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION
REJECT, ESM INFORMATION REQUEST message or ESM DUMMY MESSAGE from the network or an ESM
INFORMATION RESPONSE message or ESM DUMMY MESSAGE from the UE, the sending entity shall include the
procedure transaction identity value received with the request message and set the EPS bearer identity to "no EPS
bearer identity assigned" (see examples in figures 6.3.2.1, 6.3.2.1a and 6.3.2.2). If the response message is the
transaction related message REMOTE UE REPORT RESPONSE message from the network, the network shall include
the procedure transaction identity value received with the request message and set the EPS bearer identity to the EPS
bearer identity value received from the ProSe UE-to-network relay (see example in figure 6.3.2.3).

If an ESM DUMMY MESSAGE is sent in response to a received ESM DUMMY MESSAGE, the sending entity shall
include the received procedure transaction identity value in the message header and set the EPS bearer identity to "no
EPS bearer identity assigned".

EPS bearer context related procedures use the EPS bearer identity as address parameter in the ESM message header.
When the network initiates an EPS bearer context related procedure, it shall include a valid EPS bearer identity value in
the message header. The procedure transaction identity value shall be set as follows:

   -    If the EPS bearer context related procedure was triggered by the receipt of a transaction related request message
        from the UE, the network shall include the procedure transaction identity value received with the transaction
        related request message in the message header of the EPS bearer context related request message (see example in

In the response message of the EPS bearer context related procedure, the UE shall include the EPS bearer identity value

6.3.3        Abnormal cases in the UE
The following abnormal case can be identified:

   a) ESM uplink message transmission failure indication by lower layers

      Unless the procedure descriptions in subclause 6.6 specify a different behaviour, the following applies:

          If lower layers indicate a TAI change, but the current TAI is not in the TAI list, the ESM procedure shall be
          aborted and re-initiated after successfully performing a tracking area updating procedure.

          If lower layers indicate a TAI change, but the current TAI is still part of the TAI list, it is up to the UE
          implementation how the ESM procedure is re-initiated.

          If lower layers indicate the TAI has not changed, it is up to the UE implementation how the ESM procedure
          is re-initiated.

   NOTE 1: The ESM procedure can typically be re-initiated using a retransmission mechanism of the uplink message
           (the one that has previously failed to be transmitted) with new sequence number and message
           authentication code information thus avoiding to restart the whole procedure.

The case a) above does not apply to the ESM INFORMATION RESPONSE message.

   NOTE 2: The ESM INFORMATION RESPONSE message can not be subjected to a transmission failure by lower
           layers due to handover as no handover message can be accepted by the UE prior to reception of the
           ATTACH ACCEPT message (see 3GPP TS 36.331 [22]).

   b) Transmission failure of the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT ACCEPT message indication
      from EMM sublayer when the UE received any ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT
      REQUEST messages during the attach procedure

      It is up to the UE implementation how the dedicated EPS bearer context activation procedure is re-initiated.

   NOTE 3: The ESM procedure can typically be re-initiated using a retransmission mechanism of the ACTIVATE
           DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT ACCEPT message or ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS
           BEARER CONTEXT REJECT message with new sequence number and message authentication code
           information thus avoiding to restart the whole procedure.


6.3.4        Abnormal cases in the network
The following abnormal case can be identified:

   a) Lower layer indication of non-delivered NAS PDU due to handover

      Unless the procedure descriptions in subclause 6.4, 6.5 or 6.6 specify a different behaviour, the following
      applies:

      If the downlink ESM NAS message could not be delivered due to an intra MME handover and the target TA is
      included in the TAI list, then upon successful completion of the intra MME handover the MME shall retransmit
      the ESM message. If a failure of the handover procedure is reported by the lower layer and the S1 signalling
      connection exists, the MME shall retransmit the downlink ESM NAS message.

   b) Lower layer indication of non-delivered NAS PDU due to inter-eNodeB connected mode mobility when the
      transport of user data via the control plane is used

       If the downlink ESM NAS message could not be delivered due to inter-eNodeB connected mode mobility and
       the MME is not changed, then upon successful completion of inter-eNodeB connected mode mobility the MME
       shall retransmit the ESM message. If a failure of inter-eNodeB connected mode mobility is reported by the lower
       layer and the S1 signalling connection exists, the MME shall retransmit the downlink ESM NAS message.

   NOTE:      If the downlink ESM NAS message could not be delivered due to inter-eNodeB connected mode mobility
              and the MME is changed, the retransmission of downlink ESM NAS message is not supported.


6.3.5         Handling of APN based congestion control
The network may detect and start performing the APN based congestion control when one or more APN congestion
criteria as specified in 3GPP TS 23.401 [10] are met. The network may store an APN congestion back-off time on a per
UE and congested APN basis. If the UE does not provide an APN for a non-emergency PDN connection, then the MME
uses the APN which is used in PDN GW selection procedure as congested APN. When APN based congestion control
is active, the network may reject session management requests except the modification of bearer resources requests
from UEs or disconnect existing PDN connections with ESM cause value #26 "insufficient resources".

In the UE, EPS session management timers T3396 for APN based congestion control are started and stopped on a per
APN basis. The APN associated with T3396 is the APN provided by the UE when the PDN connection is established. If
no APN is included in the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST or, when applicable, in the ESM INFORMATION
RESPONSE message, then T3396 is associated with no APN. For this purpose the UE shall memorize the APN
provided to the network during the PDN connection establishment. The timer T3396 associated with no APN will never
be started due to any ESM procedure related to an emergency PDN connection. If the timer T3396 associated with no
APN is running, it does not affect the ability of the UE to request an emergency PDN connection.

If timer T3396 is running or is deactivated, and the UE is a UE configured to use AC11 – 15 in selected PLMN, then
the UE is allowed to initiate an attach procedure or any EPS session management procedure for the respective APN.


6.3.5A        Handling of group specific session management congestion control
The network may detect and start performing the group specific session management congestion control when one or
more group congestion criteria as specified in 3GPP TS 23.401 [10] are met. When group specific session management
congestion control is active, the mechanism for APN based congestion control as specified in subclause 6.3.5 shall be
followed.


6.3.6         Handling of network rejection not due to APN based congestion
              control
The network may include a back-off timer value in an EPS session management reject message to regulate the time
interval at which the UE may retry the same procedure. For ESM cause values other than #26 "insufficient resources",
the network may also include the re-attempt indicator to indicate whether the UE is allowed to re-attempt the
corresponding session management procedure for the same APN in A/Gb or Iu mode after inter-system change.

   NOTE 1: If the network includes this back-off timer value, then the UE is blocked from sending another ESM
           request for the same procedure for the same PLMN and APN combination for the specified duration.
           Therefore, the operator needs to exercise caution in determining the use of this timer value.

   NOTE 2: If the re-attempt indicator is not provided by the network, a UE registered in its HPLMN or in an
           EHPLMN can use the configured SM_RetryAtRATChange value specified in the NAS configuration MO
           or in the USIM NASCONFIG file to derive the re-attempt indicator as specified in subclauses 6.5.1.4.3,
           6.5.3.4.3, and 6.5.4.4.3.

If re-attempt in A/Gb or Iu mode is allowed, the UE shall consider the back-off timer to be applicable only to the EPS
session management in S1 mode for the rejected EPS session management procedure and the given PLMN and APN
combination. If re-attempt in A/Gb or Iu mode is not allowed, the UE shall consider the back-off timer to be applicable
to both NAS protocols, i.e. applicable to the EPS session management in S1 mode for the rejected EPS session
management procedure and to the GPRS session management in A/Gb and Iu mode for the corresponding session
management procedure and the given PLMN and APN combination.

The APN of the PLMN and APN combination associated with the back-off timer is the APN provided by the UE when
the PDN connection is established. If no APN is included in the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST or, when



                                                         ETSI
3GPP TS 24.301 version 15.8.0 Release 15                   238                        ETSI TS 124 301 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


applicable, in the ESM INFORMATION RESPONSE message, then the back-off timer is associated with the
combination of the PLMN and no APN. For this purpose the UE shall memorize the APN provided to the network
during the PDN connection establishment. The back-off timer associated with the combination of a PLMN with no
APN will never be started due to any ESM procedure related to an emergency PDN connection. If the back-off timer
associated with the combination of a PLMN with no APN is running, it does not affect the ability of the UE to request
an emergency PDN connection.

The network may additionally indicate in the re-attempt indicator that a command to back-off is applicable not only for
the PLMN in which the UE received the EPS session management reject message, but for each PLMN included in the
equivalent PLMN list at the time when the EPS session management reject message was received.

If the back-off timer is running or is deactivated for a given PLMN and APN combination, and the UE is a UE
configured to use AC11 – 15 in selected PLMN, then the UE is allowed to initiate an attach procedure or any EPS
session management procedure for this PLMN and APN combination.


6.3.7         Handling of WLAN offload control
In networks that support offloading of traffic to WLAN, as specified in 3GPP TS 36.331 [22], a permission to offload is
determined for the UE and the PDN connection in accordance with 3GPP TS 23.401 [10] subclause 4.3.23.


6.3.8         Handling of serving PLMN rate control
Serving PLMN rate control enables the serving PLMN to protect its MME and the signalling radio bearers in the E-
UTRAN from load generated by NAS messages with user data over control plane. The MME can inform the UE of any
local serving PLMN rate control during the default EPS bearer context activation procedure (see subclause 6.4.1). If the
serving PLMN rate control is enabled, the MME shall start the serving PLMN rate control for the PDN connection
when the first NAS message with user data over control plane is received over the PDN connection. The UE shall limit
the rate at which it generates uplink NAS messages with user data over control plane to comply with the serving PLMN
policy provided by the network. The indicated rate in a NAS procedure applies to the PDN connection the NAS
procedure corresponds to, and the indicated rate is valid until the PDN connection is released.

Serving PLMN rate control is applicable for PDN connections established for control plane CIoT EPS optimization
only.

Any serving PLMN rate control information provided by the network to the UE is only applicable for the PLMN which
provided this information. This serving PLMN rate control information shall be discarded when the UE successfully
registers to another PLMN.

   NOTE:      The serving PLMN can discard or delay NAS messages including user data over control plane that exceed
              the limit provided for serving PLMN rate control.


6.3.9         Handling of APN rate control
APN rate control controls the maximum number of uplink user data messages including uplink exception data reporting
sent by the UE in a time interval for the APN in accordance with 3GPP TS 23.401 [10]. The UE shall limit the rate at
which it generates uplink user data messages to comply with the APN rate control policy. The NAS shall provide the
indicated rates to upper layers for enforcement. The indicated rates in a NAS procedure applies to the APN the NAS
procedure corresponds to, and the indicated rates are valid until a new value is indicated or the last PDN connection
using this APN is released.

If the UE supports APN rate control, the UE shall provide the support indication of APN rate control and additional
APN rate control for exception data reporting to the network. If the UE indicates support of additional APN rate control
for exception data reporting, the network may provide the APN rate control parameters for exception data to the UE. If
the UE does not indicate support of additional APN rate control for exception data reporting, the network shall not
provide the APN rate control parameters for exception data to the UE.

If an allowed indication of additional exception reports is provided with the APN rate control parameters and:

       -   the additional APN rate control parameters for exception data is provided and the limit for additional rate for
           exception data reporting is not reached; or

       -   the additional APN rate control parameters for exception data is not provided,

3GPP TS 24.301 version 15.8.0 Release 15                  239                        ETSI TS 124 301 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


the UE is allowed to send uplink exception reports even if the limit for the APN rate control has been reached.

   NOTE:      The HPLMN can discard or delay user data that exceeds the limit provided for APN rate control.


6.3.10        Handling of 3GPP PS data off
A UE, which supports 3GPP PS data off (see 3GPP TS 23.401 [10]), can be configured with up to two lists of 3GPP PS
data off exempt services as specified in 3GPP TS 24.368 [15A] or in the EF3GPPPSDATAOFF USIM file as specified in
3GPP TS 31.102 [17]:

   -   a list of 3GPP PS data off exempt services to be used in the HPLMN or EHPLMN; and

   -   a list of 3GPP PS data off exempt services to be used in the VPLMN.

If only the list of 3GPP PS data off exempt services to be used in the HPLMN or EHPLMN is configured at the UE, this
list shall be also used in the VPLMN.

If the UE supports 3GPP PS data off, the UE shall provide the 3GPP PS data off UE status in the protocol configuration
options IE during attach, UE-requested PDN connectivity, and UE-requested bearer resource modification procedure
(see subclause 5.5.1, 6.5.1, and 6.5.4).

   NOTE 1: The sending of the 3GPP PS data off UE status to the network happens also when the user activates or
           deactivates 3GPP PS data off while connected via WLAN access only, and then handover to 3GPP access
           occur.

The network informs the UE about the support of 3GPP PS data off during the activation of the the default bearer of a
PDN connection (see subclause 6.4.1). If 3GPP PS data off support is not indicated in the protocol configuration options
IE in the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message, the UE shall not indicate any change
of 3GPP PS data off UE status for the PDN connection established by the default EPS bearer context activation
procedure; otherwise the UE shall indicate change of the 3GPP PS data off UE status for the PDN connection by using
the UE-requested bearer resource modification procedure as specified in subclause 6.5.4. If the network does not
provide indication of support of 3GPP PS data off during default EPS bearer context activation procedure of the PDN
connection, the UE behaviour for non-exempt service requests from the network is implementation dependent.

When the 3GPP PS data off UE status is "activated":

   a) the UE does not send uplink IP packets except:

       -   for those services indicated in the list of 3GPP PS data off exempt services to be used in the HPLMN or
           EHPLMN as specified in 3GPP TS 24.368 [15A] when the UE is in its HPLMN or EHPLMN;

       -   for those services indicated in the list of 3GPP PS data off exempt services to be used in the HPLMN or
           EHPLMN when the UE is in the VPLMN, if only the list of 3GPP PS data off exempt services to be used in
           the HPLMN or EHPLMN is configured to the UE as specified in 3GPP TS 24.368 [15A];

       -   for those services indicated in the list of 3GPP PS data off exempt services to be used in the VPLMN when
           the UE is in the VPLMN, if the list of 3GPP PS data off exempt services to be used in the VPLMN is
           configured to the UE as specified in 3GPP TS 24.368 [15A];

       -   for those services indicated in the EF3GPPPSDATAOFF USIM file as specified in 3GPP TS 31.102 [17];

       -   any uplink traffic due to procedures specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [13D]; and

       -   any uplink traffic due to procedures specified in 3GPP TS 24.623 [50]; and

   b) the UE does not send uplink non-IP user data packets.

Otherwise the UE sends uplink user data packets without restriction.

   NOTE 2: If the UE supports 3GPP PS data off, uplink IP packets are filtered as specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [13D]
           in L.3.1.5.

6.3.11        Handling of Reliable Data Service
If the UE supports Reliable Data Service (see 3GPP TS 24.250 [51]), the UE may request data transfer using Reliable
Data Service for a PDN connection in the extended protocol configuration options IE during attach and UE-requested
PDN connectivity procedures (see subclause 5.5.1 and 6.5.1).

The Reliable Data Service may only be used with PDN connections for which the "Control plane only" indicator is set
or with PDN connections using the control plane CIoT EPS optimization when the MME does not move such PDN
connections to the user plane.

The SCEF or P-GW shall inform the UE about the acceptance of UE's request for Reliable Data Service usage during
the activation of the default bearer of a PDN connection (see subclause 6.4.1) in the extended protocol configuration
options IE in the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message.

If the SCEF or P-GW accepts the use of Reliable Data Service to transfer data for the specified PDN connection, the UE
shall use this PDN connection exclusively for data transfer using Reliable Data Service; otherwise the UE shall not use
this PDN connection for data transfer using Reliable Data Service.


6.4           Network initiated ESM procedures
6.4.1         Default EPS bearer context activation procedure

6.4.1.1          General
The purpose of the default bearer context activation procedure is to establish a default EPS bearer context between the
UE and the EPC. The default EPS bearer context activation procedure is initiated by the network as a response to the
PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message from the UE. The default bearer context activation procedure can be part
of the attach procedure, and if the attach procedure fails, the UE shall consider that the default bearer activation has
implicitly failed. The default EPS bearer context does not have any TFT assigned during the activation procedure. This
corresponds to using a match-all packet filter. The network may at anytime after the establishment of this bearer assign
a TFT to the default EPS bearer and may subsequently modify the TFT or the packet filters of this default bearer.

6.4.1.2          Default EPS bearer context activation initiated by the network
The MME shall initiate the default bearer context activation procedure by sending an ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS
BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message and enter the state BEARER CONTEXT ACTIVE PENDING (see example
in figure 6.4.1.2.1). When the default bearer is activated as part of the attach procedure, the MME shall send the
ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message together with ATTACH ACCEPT and shall
not start the timer T3485. When the default bearer is activated as the response to a stand-alone PDN CONNECTIVITY
REQUEST message apart from the attach procedure, the MME shall send the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER
CONTEXT REQUEST message alone, and start the timer T3485.

The MME shall assign and include an EPS bearer identity in the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT
REQUEST message selecting a value as specified by subclause 9.3.2. The MME shall retrieve the PTI from the PDN
CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message and include it in the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT
REQUEST message. Both the network identifier part and the operator identifier part shall be included in the Access
Point Name IE.

6.4.1.3          Default EPS bearer context activation accepted by the UE
Upon receipt of the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message, if the UE provided an
APN for the establishment of the PDN connection, the UE shall stop timer T3396 if it is running for the APN provided
by the UE. If the UE did not provide an APN for the establishment of the PDN connection and the request type was
different from "emergency" and from "handover of emergency bearer services", the UE shall stop the timer T3396
associated with no APN if it is running. If the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message
was received in response to a request for an emergency PDN connection, the UE shall not stop the timer T3396
associated with no APN if it is running. For any case, the UE shall then send an ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER
CONTEXT ACCEPT message and enter the state BEARER CONTEXT ACTIVE. When the default bearer is activated
as part of the attach procedure, the UE shall send the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT ACCEPT
message together with ATTACH COMPLETE message. When the default bearer is activated as the response to the
stand-alone PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message, the UE shall send the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER
CONTEXT ACCEPT message alone.

If a WLAN offload indication information element is included in the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER
CONTEXT REQUEST message, the UE shall store the WLAN offload acceptability values for this PDN connection
and use the E-UTRAN offload acceptability value to determine whether this PDN connection is offloadable to WLAN
or not.

The UE checks the PTI in the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message to identify the
UE requested PDN connectivity procedure to which the default bearer context activation is related (see subclause 6.5.1).

If the UE receives a serving PLMN rate control IE in the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT
REQUEST message, the UE shall store the serving PLMN rate control IE value and use the stored serving PLMN rate
control value as the maximum allowed limit of uplink User data container IEs included in ESM DATA TRANSPORT
messages for the corresponding PDN connection in accordance with 3GPP TS 23.401 [10].

If the UE receives an APN rate control parameters container in the protocol configuration options IE or extended
protocol configuration options IE in the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message, the
UE shall store the APN rate control parameters value and use the stored APN rate control parameters value as the
maximum allowed limit of uplink user data related to the APN indicated in the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER
CONTEXT REQUEST message in accordance with 3GPP TS 23.401 [10]. If the UE has a previously stored APN rate
control parameters value for this APN, the UE shall replace the stored APN rate control parameters value for this APN
with the received APN rate control parameters value.

If the UE receives an additional APN rate control parameters for exception data container in the protocol configuration
options IE or extended protocol configuration options IE in the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT
REQUEST message, the UE shall store the additional APN rate control parameters for exception data value and use the
stored additional APN rate control parameters for exception data value as the maximum allowed limit of uplink
exception data related to the APN indicated in the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST
message in accordance with 3GPP TS 23.401 [10]. If the UE has a previously stored additional APN rate control
parameters for exception data value for this APN, the UE shall replace the stored additional APN rate control

parameters for exception data value for this APN with the received additional APN rate control parameters for
exception data value.

If the UE receives non-IP Link MTU parameter or IPv4 Link MTU parameter of the protocol configuration options IE
in the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message, the UE shall pass the received Non-IP
Link MTU or IPv4 Link MTU to the upper layer.

   NOTE:      The Non-IP Link MTU and the IPv4 Link MTU size correspond to the maximum length of user data that
              can be sent either in the user data container in the ESM DATA TRANSPORT message or via S1-U
              interface.

Upon receipt of the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT ACCEPT message, the MME shall enter the
state BEARER CONTEXT ACTIVE and stop the timer T3485, if the timer is running. If the PDN CONNECTIVITY
REQUEST message included a low priority indicator set to "MS is configured for NAS signalling low priority", the
MME shall store the NAS signalling low priority indication within the default EPS bearer context.

6.4.1.4          Default EPS bearer context activation not accepted by the UE
If the default EPS bearer context activation is part of the attach procedure, the ESM sublayer shall notify the EMM
sublayer of an ESM failure. If EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is supported by the UE and the MME,
the ESM sublayer shall additionally provide an ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REJECT message
to the EMM sublayer.

If the default EPS bearer context activation is not part of the attach procedure, the UE shall send an ACTIVATE
DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REJECT message and enter the state BEARER CONTEXT INACTIVE.

The ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REJECT message contains an ESM cause that typically
indicates one of the following cause values:

   #26:   insufficient resources;

   #31:   request rejected, unspecified; or

   #95 – 111:    protocol errors.

Upon receipt of the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REJECT message, the MME shall enter the
state BEARER CONTEXT INACTIVE and stop the timer T3485, if the timer is running.

6.4.1.5          Abnormal cases in the UE
The following abnormal cases can be identified:

   a) Default EPS bearer context activation request for an already activated default EPS bearer context:

       If the UE receives an ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message with an EPS
       bearer identity identical to the EPS bearer identity of an already activated default EPS bearer context, the UE
       shall locally deactivate the existing default EPS bearer context and all the associated dedicated EPS bearer
       contexts, if any, and proceed with the requested default EPS bearer context activation.

   b) Default EPS bearer context activation request for an already activated dedicated EPS bearer context:

       If the UE receives an ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message with an EPS
       bearer identity identical to the EPS bearer identity of an already activated dedicated EPS bearer context, the UE
       shall locally deactivate the existing dedicated EPS bearer context and proceed with the requested default EPS
       bearer context activation.

6.4.1.6          Abnormal cases on the network side
The following abnormal cases can be identified:

   a) Expiry of timer T3485:

       On the first expiry of the timer T3485, the MME shall resend the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER
       CONTEXT REQUEST and shall reset and restart timer T3485. This retransmission is repeated four times, i.e. on

       the fifth expiry of timer T3485, the MME shall release possibly allocated resources for this activation and shall
       abort the procedure.

   b) Lower layer indicates that the HeNB rejected the establishment of the default bearer (see 3GPP TS 36.413 [23])
      for a LIPA PDN connection or SIPTO at the local network PDN connection due to a triggered handover:

       The MME shall enter the state BEARER CONTEXT INACTIVE,stop timer T3485 and reject the PDN
       connectivity request procedure including the ESM cause value #34 "service option temporarily out of order" in
       the PDN CONNECTIVITY REJECT message. The MME shall release possibly allocated resources for this
       activation.


6.4.2         Dedicated EPS bearer context activation procedure

6.4.2.1           General
The purpose of the dedicated EPS bearer context activation procedure is to establish an EPS bearer context with specific
QoS and TFT between the UE and the EPC.

In WB-S1 mode, the dedicated EPS bearer context activation procedure is initiated by the network, but may be
requested by the UE by means of the UE requested bearer resource allocation procedure (see subclause 6.5.3) or the UE
requested bearer resource modification procedure (see subclause 6.5.4). The dedicated bearer context activation
procedure can be part of the attach procedure or be initiated together with the default EPS bearer context activation
procedure when the UE initiated stand-alone PDN connectivity procedure. If the attach procedure or the default EPS
bearer context activation procedure fails, the UE shall consider that the dedicated bearer activation has implicitly failed.
The network may initiate the dedicated EPS bearer context activation procedure together with the completion of the
service request procedure.

In NB-S1 mode, the dedicated EPS bearer contexts activation procedure is not used.

   NOTE:      3GPP TS 23.060 [74] subclause 9.3 specifies that a packet filter applicable for the downlink direction is
              not mandatory in a TFT.

6.4.2.2           Dedicated EPS bearer context activation initiated by the network
In WB-S1 mode, the MME shall initiate the dedicated bearer context activation procedure by sending an ACTIVATE
DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message, start the timer T3485, and enter the state BEARER
CONTEXT ACTIVE PENDING (see example in figure 6.4.2.2.1).

The MME allocates the EPS bearer identity selecting a value as specified by subclause 9.3.2, and includes it in the
ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message. The MME shall include the EPS bearer
identity of the associated default bearer as the linked EPS bearer identity in the ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS
BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message. If this procedure was initiated by a UE requested bearer resource allocation
procedure or a UE requested bearer resource modification procedure, the ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER
CONTEXT REQUEST shall contain the procedure transaction identity (PTI) value received by the MME in the
BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST or BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST
respectively.

6.4.2.3           Dedicated EPS bearer context activation accepted by the UE
Upon receipt of the ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message, if the UE provided an
APN for the establishment of the PDN connection, the UE shall stop timer T3396, if it is running for the APN provided
by the UE. If the UE did not provide an APN for the establishment of the PDN connection and the request type was
different from "emergency" and from "handover of emergency bearer services", the UE shall stop the timer T3396
associated with no APN if it is running. If the ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST
message was received for an emergency PDN connection, the UE shall not stop the timer T3396 associated with no
APN if it is running. For any case, the UE shall then check the received TFT before taking it into use, send an
ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT ACCEPT message and enter the state BEARER CONTEXT
ACTIVE. The ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT ACCEPT message shall include the EPS bearer
identity.

The linked EPS bearer identity included in the ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST
message indicates to the UE to which default bearer, IP address and PDN the dedicated bearer is linked.

If the ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message contains a PTI value other than "no
procedure transaction identity assigned" and "reserved" (see 3GPP TS 24.007 [12]), the UE uses the PTI to identify the
UE requested bearer resource allocation procedure or the UE requested bearer resource modification procedure to which
the dedicated bearer context activation is related.

If the ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message contains a PTI value other than "no
procedure transaction identity assigned" and "reserved" (see 3GPP TS 24.007 [12]) and the PTI is associated to a UE
requested bearer resource allocation procedure or a UE requested bearer resource modification procedure, the UE shall
release the traffic flow aggregate description associated to the PTI value provided.

The UE shall use the received TFT to apply mapping of uplink traffic flows to the radio bearer.

The UE shall treat any packet filter without explicit direction as being bi-directional.

If the UE receives an APN rate control parameters container in the protocol configuration options IE or extended
protocol configuration options IE in the ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message,
the UE shall store the APN rate control parameters value and use the stored APN rate control parameters value as the
maximum allowed limit of uplink user data related to the corresponding APN in accordance with 3GPP TS 23.401 [10].
If the UE has a previously stored APN rate control parameters value for this APN, the UE shall replace the stored APN
rate control parameters value for this APN with the received APN rate control parameters value.

If the UE receives an additional APN rate control parameters for exception data container in the protocol configuration
options IE or extended protocol configuration options IE in the ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT
REQUEST message, the UE shall store the additional APN rate control parameters for exception data value and use the
stored additional APN rate control parameters for exception data value as the maximum allowed limit of uplink
exception data related to the corresponding APN in accordance with 3GPP TS 23.401 [10]. If the UE has a previously
stored additional APN rate control parameters for exception data value for this APN, the UE shall replace the stored

additional APN rate control parameters for exception data value for this APN with the received additional APN rate
control parameters for exception data value.

If the UE receives QoS rule(s) of the 5GS QoS flow(s), which corresponds to the dedicated EPS bearer being activated,
in the protocol configuration options IE or the extended protocol configuration options IE of the ACTIVATE
DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message, the UE stores the QoS rule(s) for use during inter-
system change from S1 mode to N1 mode.

Upon receipt of the ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT ACCEPT message, the MME shall stop the
timerT3485 and enter the state BEARER CONTEXT ACTIVE.

6.4.2.4          Dedicated EPS bearer context activation not accepted by the UE
Upon receipt of the ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message, the UE may reject the
request from the MME by sending an ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REJECT message. The
message shall include the EPS bearer identity and an ESM cause value indicating the reason for rejecting the dedicated
EPS bearer context activation request.

The ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REJECT message contains an ESM cause that typically
indicates one of the following ESM cause values:

   #26:   insufficient resources;

   #31:   request rejected, unspecified;

   #41:   semantic error in the TFT operation;

   #42:   syntactical error in the TFT operation;

   #43:   invalid EPS bearer identity;

   #44:   semantic error(s) in packet filter(s);

   #45:   syntactical error(s) in packet filter(s); or

   #95 – 111:    protocol errors.

The UE shall check the TFT in the request message for different types of TFT IE errors as follows:

   a) Semantic errors in TFT operations:

       1) When the TFT operation is an operation other than "Create a new TFT"

       The UE shall reject the activation request with ESM cause #41 "semantic error in the TFT operation".

   b) Syntactical errors in TFT operations:

       1) When the TFT operation = "Create a new TFT" and the packet filter list in the TFT IE is empty.

       2) When there are other types of syntactical errors in the coding of the TFT IE, such as a mismatch between the
          number of packet filters subfield, and the number of packet filters in the packet filter list.

       The UE shall reject the activation request with ESM cause #42 "syntactical error in the TFT operation".

   c) Semantic errors in packet filters:

       1) When a packet filter consists of conflicting packet filter components which would render the packet filter
          ineffective, i.e. no IP packet will ever fit this packet filter. How the UE determines a semantic error in a
          packet filter is outside the scope of the present document.

       2) When the resulting TFT does not contain any packet filter which applicable for the uplink direction.

       The UE shall reject the activation request with ESM cause #44 "semantic errors in packet filter(s)".

   d) Syntactical errors in packet filters:




                                                          ETSI
3GPP TS 24.301 version 15.8.0 Release 15                   246                        ETSI TS 124 301 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


      1) When the TFT operation = "Create a new TFT" and two or more packet filters in the resultant TFT would
         have identical packet filter identifiers.

      2) When the TFT operation = "Create a new TFT" and two or more packet filters in all TFTs associated with
         this PDN connection would have identical packet filter precedence values.

      3) When there are other types of syntactical errors in the coding of packet filters, such as the use of a reserved
         value for a packet filter component identifier.

      In case 2, if the old packet filters do not belong to the default EPS bearer context, the UE shall not diagnose an
      error, shall further process the new activation request and, if it was processed successfully, shall delete the old
      packet filters which have identical filter precedence values. Furthermore, by means of explicit peer-to-peer
      signalling between the network and the UE, the UE shall perform a UE requested bearer resource modification
      procedure to deactivate the EPS bearer context(s) for which it has deleted the packet filters.

      In case 2, if one or more old packet filters belong to the default EPS bearer context, the UE shall release the
      relevant PDN connection. If the relevant PDN connection is the last one that the UE has and EMM-
      REGISTERED without PDN connection is not supported by the UE or the MME, the UE shall detach and re-
      attach to the network.

      In cases 1 and 3 the UE shall reject the activation request with ESM cause #45 "syntactical errors in packet
      filter(s)".

Upon receipt of the ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REJECT message in state BEARER
CONTEXT ACTIVE PENDING, the MME shall stop the timer T3485, enter the state BEARER CONTEXT
INACTIVE and abort the dedicated EPS bearer context activation procedure. The MME also requests the lower layer to
release the radio resources that were established during the dedicated EPS bearer context activation procedure.

6.4.2.5          Abnormal cases in the UE
The following abnormal cases can be identified:

   a) Dedicated EPS bearer context activation request for an already activated default EPS bearer context:

      If the UE receives an ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message with an EPS
      bearer identity identical to the EPS bearer identity of an already activated default EPS bearer context, the UE
      shall locally deactivate the existing default EPS bearer context and all the associated dedicated EPS bearer
      contexts, if any, and proceed with the requested dedicated EPS bearer context activation.

   b) Dedicated EPS bearer context activation request for an already activated dedicated EPS bearer context

      If the UE receives an ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message with an EPS
      bearer identity identical to the EPS bearer identity of an already activated dedicated EPS bearer context, the UE
      shall locally deactivate the existing dedicated EPS bearer context and proceed with the requested dedicated EPS
      bearer context activation.

   c) No default EPS bearer context with linked EPS bearer identity activated

      If the linked EPS bearer identity included in the ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT
      REQUEST message does not match the EPS bearer identity of any activated default EPS bearer context, the UE
      shall reply with an ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REJECT message with ESM cause
      #43 "invalid EPS bearer identity".

   d) Dedicated EPS bearer context activation request when the PLMN's maximum number of EPS bearer contexts in
      S1 mode is reached at the UE:

      If the PLMN's maximum number of EPS bearer contexts in S1 mode is reached at the UE and the UE receives an
      ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message, the UE shall clear the determination
      representing the PLMN's maximum number of EPS bearer contexts in S1 mode and proceed with the dedicated
      EPS bearer context activation procedure.

6.4.2.6          Abnormal cases on the network side
The following abnormal cases can be identified:

3GPP TS 24.301 version 15.8.0 Release 15                 247                      ETSI TS 124 301 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


   a) Expiry of timer T3485:

      On the first expiry of the timer T3485, the MME shall resend the ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER
      CONTEXT REQUEST and shall reset and restart timer T3485. This retransmission is repeated four times, i.e. on
      the fifth expiry of timer T3485, the MME shall abort the procedure, release any resources allocated for this
      activation and enter the state BEARER CONTEXT INACTIVE.

   b) Collision of UE requested PDN disconnect procedure and dedicated EPS bearer context activation procedure:

      When the MME receives a PDN DISCONNECT REQUEST message during the dedicated EPS bearer context
      activation procedure, and the EPS bearer to be activated belongs to the PDN connection the UE wants to
      disconnect, the MME shall terminate the dedicated bearer context activation procedure locally, release any
      resources related to this procedure and proceed with the PDN disconnect procedure.


6.4.3        EPS bearer context modification procedure

6.4.3.1          General
The purpose of the EPS bearer context modification procedure is to modify an EPS bearer context with a specific QoS
and TFT, or re-negotiate header compression configuration associated to an EPS bearer context. The EPS bearer context
modification procedure is initiated by the network, but it may also be initiated as part of the UE requested bearer
resource allocation procedure or the UE requested bearer resource modification procedure.

The network may also initiate the EPS bearer context modification procedure to update the APN-AMBR of the UE, for
instance after an inter-system handover. See 3GPP TS 23.401 [10] annex E.

The MME may also initiate the EPS bearer context modification procedure to update the WLAN offload indication to
the UE, for instance after the MME received an updated WLAN offload indication of a PDN Connection from HSS. See
3GPP TS 23.401 [10] subclause 4.3.23.

The MME may also initiate the EPS bearer context modification procedure to update information required for inter-
system change from S1 mode to N1 mode (e.g. session-AMBR, QoS rule(s)). See 3GPP TS 24.501 [54].

The network may initiate the EPS bearer context modification procedure together with the completion of the service
request procedure.

6.4.3.2          EPS bearer context modification initiated by the network
The MME shall initiate the EPS bearer context modification procedure by sending a MODIFY EPS BEARER
CONTEXT REQUEST message to the UE, starting the timer T3486, and entering the state BEARER CONTEXT
MODIFY PENDING (see example in figure 6.4.3.2.1).

The MME shall include an EPS bearer identity that identifies the EPS bearer context to be modified in the MODIFY
EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message.

If this procedure was initiated by a UE requested bearer resource allocation procedure or a UE requested bearer
resource modification procedure, the MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST shall contain the procedure
transaction identity (PTI) value received by the MME in the BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST or
BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST respectively.

If the UE indicated "Control plane CIoT EPS optimization supported" and "Header compression for control plane CIoT
EPS optimization supported" in the UE network capability IE in the latest ATTACH REQUEST message or the
TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, and the MME supports Control plane CIoT EPS optimization and
Header compression for control plane CIoT EPS optimization, the MME may include the Header compression
configuration IE in the MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message to re-negotiate header compression
configuration associated to an EPS bearer context.

6.4.3.3          EPS bearer context modification accepted by the UE
Upon receipt of the MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message, if the UE provided an APN for the
establishment of the PDN connection, the UE shall stop timer T3396, if it is running for the APN provided by the UE. If
the UE did not provide an APN for the establishment of the PDN connection and the request type was different from
"emergency" and from "handover of emergency bearer services", the UE shall stop the timer T3396 associated with no
APN if it is running. If the MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message was received for an emergency
PDN connection, the UE shall not stop the timer T3396 associated with no APN if it is running. For any case, the UE
shall then check the received TFT before taking it into use and send a MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT ACCEPT
message to the MME.

If the MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message contains a PTI value other than "no procedure
transaction identity assigned" and "reserved" (see 3GPP TS 24.007 [12]), the UE uses the PTI to identify the UE
requested bearer resource allocation procedure or the UE requested bearer resource modification procedure to which the
EPS bearer context modification is related (see subclause 6.5.3 and subclause 6.5.4).

If the MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message contains a PTI value other than "no procedure
transaction identity assigned" and "reserved" (see 3GPP TS 24.007 [12]) and the PTI is associated to a UE requested
bearer resource allocation procedure or a UE requested bearer resource modification procedure, the UE shall release the
traffic flow aggregate description associated to the PTI value provided.

If the EPS bearer context that is modified is a GBR bearer and the MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST
message does not contain the Guaranteed Bit Rate (GBR) and the Maximum Bit Rate (MBR) values for uplink and
downlink, the UE shall continue to use the previously received values for the Guaranteed Bit Rate (GBR) and the
Maximum Bit Rate (MBR) for the corresponding bearer.

The UE shall use the received TFT to apply mapping of uplink traffic flows to the radio bearer if the TFT contains
packet filters for the uplink direction.

If a WLAN offload indication information element is included in the MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST
message, the UE shall store the WLAN offload acceptability values for this PDN connection and use the E-UTRAN
offload acceptability value to determine whether this PDN connection is offloadable to WLAN or not.

If the UE receives an APN rate control parameters container in the protocol configuration options IE or extended
protocol configuration options IE in the MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message, the UE shall store
the APN rate control parameters value and use the stored APN rate control parameters value as the maximum allowed
limit of uplink user data related to the corresponding APN in accordance with 3GPP TS 23.401 [10]. If the UE has a
previously stored APN rate control parameters value for this APN, the UE shall replace the stored APN rate control
parameters value for this APN with the received APN rate control parameters value.

If the UE receives an additional APN rate control parameters for exception data container in the protocol configuration
options IE or extended protocol configuration options IE in the MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST
message, the UE shall store the additional APN rate control parameters for exception data value and use the stored
additional APN rate control parameters for exception data value as the maximum allowed limit of uplink exception data

related to the corresponding APN in accordance with 3GPP TS 23.401 [10]. If the UE has a previously stored additional
APN rate control parameters for exception data value for this APN, the UE shall replace the stored additional APN rate
control parameters for exception data value for this APN with the received additional APN rate control parameters for
exception data value.

Upon receipt of the MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message with a session-AMBR and QoS rule(s) in
the protocol configuration options IE or the extended protocol configuration options IE, the UE stores the session-
AMBR and QoS rule(s) for use during inter-system change from S1 mode to N1 mode.

Upon receipt of the MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT ACCEPT message, the MME shall stop the timer T3486 and
enter the state BEARER CONTEXT ACTIVE.

6.4.3.4           EPS bearer context modification not accepted by the UE
Upon receipt of the MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message, the UE may reject the request from the
MME by sending a MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REJECT message to the MME. The message shall include the
EPS bearer identity and an ESM cause value indicating the reason for rejecting the EPS bearer context modification
request.

The MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REJECT message contains an ESM cause that typically indicates one of the
following ESM cause values:

   #26:    insufficient resources;

   #41:    semantic error in the TFT operation;

   #42:    syntactical error in the TFT operation;

   #43:    invalid EPS bearer identity;

   #44:    semantic error(s) in packet filter(s);

   #45:    syntactical error(s) in packet filter(s); or

   #95 – 111:     protocol errors.

The UE shall check the TFT in the request message for different types of TFT IE errors as follows:

   a) Semantic errors in TFT operations:

       1) TFT operation = "Create a new TFT" when there is already an existing TFT for the EPS bearer context.

       2) When the TFT operation is an operation other than "Create a new TFT" and there is no TFT for the EPS
          bearer context.

       3) TFT operation = "Delete packet filters from existing TFT" when it would render the TFT empty.

       4) TFT operation = "Delete existing TFT" for a dedicated EPS bearer context.

       In case 4 the UE shall reject the modification request with ESM cause #41 "semantic error in the TFT
       operation".

       In the other cases the UE shall not diagnose an error and perform the following actions to resolve the
       inconsistency:

       In case 1 the UE shall further process the new activation request and, if it was processed successfully, delete the
       old TFT.

       In case 2 the UE shall:

       -   process the new request and if the TFT operation is "Delete existing TFT" or "Delete packet filters from
           existing TFT", and if no error according to items b, c, and d was detected, consider the TFT as successfully
           deleted;

       -   process the new request as an activation request, if the TFT operation is "Add packet filters in existing TFT"
           or "Replace packet filters in existing TFT".

      In case 3, if the packet filters belong to a dedicated EPS bearer context, the UE shall process the new deletion
      request and, if no error according to items b, c, and d was detected, the UE shall reject the modification request
      with ESM cause #41 "semantic error in the TFT operation".

      In case 3, if the packet filters belong to the default EPS bearer context, the UE shall process the new deletion
      request and if no error according to items b, c, and d was detected then delete the existing TFT, this corresponds
      to using match-all packet filter for the default EPS bearer context.

   b) Syntactical errors in TFT operations:

      1) When the TFT operation = "Create a new TFT", "Add packet filters in existing TFT", "Replace packet filters
         in existing TFT" or "Delete packet filters from existing TFT" and the packet filter list in the TFT IE is empty.

      2) TFT operation = "Delete existing TFT" or "No TFT operation" with a non-empty packet filter list in the TFT
         IE.

      3) TFT operation = "Replace packet filters in existing TFT" when the packet filter to be replaced does not exist
         in the original TFT.

      4) TFT operation = "Delete packet filters from existing TFT" when the packet filter to be deleted does not exist
         in the original TFT.

      5) TFT operation = "Delete packet filters from existing TFT" with a packet filter list also including packet
         filters in addition to the packet filter identifiers.

      6) When there are other types of syntactical errors in the coding of the TFT IE, such as a mismatch between the
         number of packet filters subfield, and the number of packet filters in the packet filter list.

      In case 3 the UE shall not diagnose an error, further process the replace request and, if no error according to
      items c and d was detected, include the packet filters received to the existing TFT.

      In case 4 the UE shall not diagnose an error, further process the deletion request and, if no error according to
      items c and d was detected, consider the respective packet filter as successfully deleted.

      Otherwise the UE shall reject the modification request with ESM cause #42 "syntactical error in the TFT
      operation".

   c) Semantic errors in packet filters:

      1) When a packet filter consists of conflicting packet filter components which would render the packet filter
         ineffective, i.e. no IP packet will ever fit this packet filter. How the UE determines a semantic error in a
         packet filter is outside the scope of the present document.

      2) When the resulting TFT, which is assigned to a dedicated EPS bearer context, does not contain any packet
         filter applicable for the uplink direction among the packet filters created on request from the network.

      The UE shall reject the modification request with ESM cause #44 "semantic errors in packet filter(s)".

   d) Syntactical errors in packet filters:

      1) When the TFT operation = "Create a new TFT", "Add packet filters to existing TFT", and two or more
         packet filters in the resultant TFT would have identical packet filter identifiers.

      2) When the TFT operation = "Create a new TFT", "Add packet filters to existing TFT" or "Replace packet
         filters in existing TFT", and two or more packet filters among all TFTs associated with this PDN connection
         would have identical packet filter precedence values.

      3) When there are other types of syntactical errors in the coding of packet filters, such as the use of a reserved
         value for a packet filter component identifier.

      In case 1, if two or more packet filters with identical packet filter identifiers are contained in the new request, the
      UE shall reject the modification request with ESM cause #45 "syntactical errors in packet filter(s)". Otherwise,
      the UE shall not diagnose an error, further process the new request and, if it was processed successfully, delete
      the old packet filters which have the identical packet filter identifiers.

       In case 2, if the old packet filters do not belong to the default EPS bearer context, the UE shall not diagnose an
       error, shall further process the new request and, if it was processed successfully, shall delete the old packet filters
       which have identical filter precedence values. Furthermore, the UE shall perform a UE requested bearer resource
       modification request procedure to deactivate the dedicated EPS bearer context(s) for which it has deleted the
       packet filters.

       In case 2, if one or more old packet filters belong to the default EPS bearer context, the UE shall release the
       relevant PDN connection. If the relevant PDN connection is the last one that the UE has and EMM-
       REGISTERED without PDN connection is not supported by the UE or the MME, the UE shall detach and re-

"invalid EPS bearer identity" in state BEARER CONTEXT MODIFY PENDING, the MME shall stop the timer T3486,
enter the state BEARER CONTEXT ACTIVE and abort the EPS bearer context modification procedure. If the network
receives the MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REJECT message with ESM cause #43 "invalid EPS bearer identity",
the MME locally deactivates the EPS bearer context(s) without peer-to-peer ESM signalling.When the MME detects
that after the failed EPS bearer context modification there is a misalignment between the EPS bearer configuration and
the EPS bearer context configuration or between the QoS on NAS and AS level, the MME should initiate the necessary
procedures to achieve a re-alignment.

6.4.3.5           Abnormal cases in the UE
Apart from the case described in subclause 6.3.3, no abnormal cases have been identified.

6.4.3.6           Abnormal cases on the network side
The following abnormal cases can be identified:

   a) Expiry of timer T3486:

       On the first expiry of the timer T3486, the MME shall resend the MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT
       REQUEST and shall reset and restart timer T3486. This retransmission is repeated four times, i.e. on the fifth
       expiry of timer T3486, the MME shall abort the procedure and enter the state BEARER CONTEXT ACTIVE.

       The MME may continue to use the previous configuration of the EPS bearer context or initiate an EPS bearer
       context deactivation procedure.

   b) Collision of UE requested PDN disconnect procedure and EPS bearer context modification:

       When the MME receives a PDN DISCONNECT REQUEST message during an EPS bearer context modification
       procedure, and the EPS bearer to be modified belongs to the PDN connection the UE wants to disconnect, the
       MME shall terminate the EPS bearer context modification procedure locally, release any resources related to this
       procedure and proceed with the PDN disconnect procedure.


6.4.4         EPS bearer context deactivation procedure

6.4.4.1           General
The purpose of the EPS bearer context deactivation procedure is to deactivate an EPS bearer context or disconnect from
a PDN by deactivating all EPS bearer contexts to the PDN. The EPS bearer context deactivation procedure is initiated
by the network, and it may be triggered by the UE by means of the UE requested bearer resource modification
procedure or UE requested PDN disconnect procedure.

In the case of EPS bearer context deactivation with reactivation requested for a PDN connection, if no NAS signalling
connection exists, the MME follows the procedures for re-establishing the NAS signalling connection and deactivating
the EPS bearer contexts to the PDN with reactivation requested, as specified in 3GPP TS 23.401 [10] subclauses 5.4.4.1
and 5.10.3 and 3GPP TS 23.380 [33] subclause 5.4.2.1.

3GPP TS 24.301 version 15.8.0 Release 15                 252                       ETSI TS 124 301 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


If a UE is receiving emergency bearer services from a CSG cell, and the CSG subscription expires or is removed, the
MME shall deactivate all non-emergency EPS bearers if any. The MME shall not deactivate the emergency EPS
bearers.

If a detach is requested by the HSS for a UE that has bearers for emergency services, the MME shall send a
DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message to the UE for all bearers that are not allocated for
emergency services.

6.4.4.2          EPS bearer context deactivation initiated by the network
If a NAS signalling connection exists when the MME initiates the EPS bearer context deactivation procedure, the MME
shall initiate the EPS bearer context deactivation procedure by sending a DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER CONTEXT
REQUEST message to the UE, start the timer T3495, and enter the state BEARER CONTEXT INACTIVE PENDING
(see example in figure 6.4.4.2.1). The DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message contains an ESM
cause typically indicating one of the following:

   #8: operator determined barring;

   #26:   insufficient resources;

   #29:   user authentication or authorization failed;

   #36:   regular deactivation;

   #38:   network failure;

   #39:   reactivation requested;

   #112: APN restriction value incompatible with active EPS bearer context; or

   #113: Multiple accesses to a PDN connection not allowed.

If the deactivation is triggered by a UE initiated bearer resource modification procedure or UE requested PDN
disconnect procedure, the DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message shall contain the procedure
transaction identity (PTI) value received by the MME in the BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST or
PDN DISCONNECT REQUEST respectively.

When the MME wants to deactivate all EPS bearer contexts of a PDN connection and thus disconnect the UE from the
PDN, the MME shall include the EPS bearer identity of the default bearer associated to the PDN in the DEACTIVATE
EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message. In this case, the MME shall not include the WLAN offload indication
in the DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message, and if the UE receives the WLAN offload
indication, the UE shall ignore the indication.

If no NAS signalling connection exists when the MME initiates the EPS bearer context deactivation, the ESM entity in
the MME shall locally deactivate the EPS bearer context towards the UE without any peer-to-peer ESM signalling
between the MME and the UE.

   NOTE:     The EPS bearer context state(s) can be synchronized between the UE and the MME at the next EMM-
             IDLE to EMM-CONNECTED transition, e.g. during a service request or tracking area updating
             procedure.

6.4.4.3          EPS bearer context deactivation accepted by the UE
Upon receipt of the DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message, the UE shall delete the EPS bearer
context identified by the EPS bearer identity. After deactivating the identified EPS bearer context, the UE shall respond
to the MME with the DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER CONTEXT ACCEPT.

If the EPS bearer identity indicated in the DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST is that of the default
bearer to a PDN, the UE shall delete all EPS bearer contexts associated to the PDN. After deactivating all EPS bearer
contexts, the UE shall respond to the MME with the DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER CONTEXT ACCEPT.

Upon sending the DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER CONTEXT ACCEPT message, the UE shall enter the state BEARER
CONTEXT INACTIVE. If due to the EPS bearer context deactivation only the PDN connection for emergency bearer
services remains established, the UE shall consider itself attached for emergency bearer services only.

If the DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST includes ESM cause #39 "reactivation requested" and the
EPS bearer context is a default EPS bearer context, and the UE provided an APN for the establishment of the PDN
connection, the UE shall stop timer T3396 if it is running for the APN provided by the UE. The UE should then re-
initiate the UE requested PDN connectivity procedure for the same APN as the deactivated default EPS bearer context
to reactivate the EPS bearer context. If the UE did not provide an APN for the establishment of the PDN connection and
the request type was different from "emergency" and from "handover of emergency bearer services", the UE shall stop
the timer T3396 associated with no APN if it is running, and should re-initiate the UE requested PDN connectivity
procedure without including an APN. Additionally, the UE should re-initiate the request(s) for dedicated bearer
resources that have been activated on request of the UE and released as a result of this EPS bearer context deactivation
procedure. If the DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message was received for an emergency PDN
connection, the UE shall not stop the timer T3396 associated with no APN if it is running. The UE should then re-
initiate the UE requested PDN connectivity procedure for the emergency PDN connection.

   NOTE 1: User interaction is necessary in some cases when the UE cannot re-activate the EPS bearer context(s)
           automatically.

   NOTE 2: The UE behaviour is not specified for the case where the DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER CONTEXT
           REQUEST includes ESM cause #39 "reactivation requested" and the deactivated EPS bearer context was
           a dedicated EPS bearer context.

If the DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message contains a PTI value other than "no procedure
transaction identity assigned" and "reserved" (see 3GPP TS 24.007 [12]), the UE uses the PTI to identify the UE
requested bearer resource modification procedure or UE requested PDN disconnect procedure to which the EPS bearer
context deactivation is related (see subclause 6.5.4).

If the DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message contains a PTI value other than "no procedure
transaction identity assigned" and "reserved" (see 3GPP TS 24.007 [12]), the UE shall release the traffic flow aggregate
description associated to the PTI value provided.

If the ESM cause value is #26 "insufficient resources", the network may include a value for timer T3396 in the
DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message. The UE shall take different actions depending on the
timer value received for timer T3396 (if the UE is configured for dual priority, exceptions are specified in
subclause 6.5.5; if the UE is a UE configured to use AC11 – 15 in selected PLMN, exceptions are specified in
subclause 6.3.5):

   i) if the timer value indicates neither zero nor deactivated, the UE shall stop timer T3396 associated with the
      corresponding APN, if it is running. The UE shall start timer T3396 with received value and not send another
      PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST, BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST with exception of
      those identified in subclause 6.5.4.1, or BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST message for the
      same APN until timer T3396 expires or the timer T3396 is stopped. If the UE did not provide an APN for the
      establishment of the PDN connection and the request type was different from "emergency" and from "handover
      of emergency bearer services", the UE shall stop timer T3396 associated with no APN, if it is running. The UE
      shall start timer T3396 with the received value and not send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST
      message without an APN and with request type different from "emergency" and from "handover of emergency
      bearer services", or another BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST with exception of those
      identified in subclause 6.5.4.1, or BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST message for a non-
      emergency PDN connection established without an APN provided by the UE, until timer T3396 expires or timer
      T3396 is stopped. The UE shall not stop timer T3396 upon a PLMN change or inter-system change;

   ii) if the timer value indicates that this timer is deactivated, the UE shall not send another PDN CONNECTIVITY
       REQUEST, BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST with exception of those identified in
       subclause 6.5.4.1, or BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST message for the same APN until the
       UE is switched off or the USIM is removed, or the UE receives an ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER
       CONTEXT REQUEST, ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST or MODIFY EPS
       BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message for the same APN from the network or a DEACTIVATE EPS
       BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message including ESM cause #39 "reactivation requested" for a default EPS
       bearer context for the same APN from the network. If the UE did not provide an APN for the establishment of
       the PDN connection and the request type was different from "emergency" and from "handover of emergency
       bearer services", the UE shall not send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message without an APN
       and with request type different from "emergency" and from "handover of emergency bearer services", or another
       BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST with exception of those identified in subclause 6.5.4.1, or
       BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST message for a non-emergency PDN connection established
       without APN provided by the UE , until the UE is switched off or the USIM is removed, or the UE receives an
       ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST, ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER
       CONTEXT REQUEST or MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message for a non-emergency PDN
       connection established without an APN provided by the UE, or a DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER CONTEXT
       REQUEST message including ESM cause #39 "reactivation requested" for a default EPS bearer context of a
       non-emergency PDN connection established without an APN provided by the UE. The timer T3396 remains
       deactivated upon a PLMN change or inter-system change; and

   iii) if the timer value indicates zero, the UE:

       -   shall stop timer T3396 associated with the corresponding APN, if running, and may send another PDN
           CONNECTIVITY REQUEST, BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST or BEARER
           RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST message for the same APN; and

       -   if the UE did not provide an APN for the establishment of the PDN connection and the request type was
           different from "emergency" and from "handover of emergency bearer services", the UE shall stop timer
           T3396 associated with no APN, if running, and may send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST
           message without an APN, or another BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST or BEARER
           RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST message for a non-emergency PDN connection established without
           an APN provided by the UE.

If the timer T3396 is running when the UE enters state EMM-DEREGISTERED, the UE remains switched on, and the
USIM in the UE remains the same, then timer T3396 is kept running until it expires or it is stopped.

If the UE is switched off when the timer T3396 is running, the UE shall behave as follows when the UE is switched on
and the USIM in the UE remains the same:

   -   let t1 be the time remaining for T3396 timeout at switch off and let t be the time elapsed between switch off and
       switch on. If t1 is greater than t, then the timer shall be restarted with the value t1 – t. If t1 is equal to or less than
       t, then the timer need not be restarted. If the UE is not capable of determining t, then the UE shall restart the
       timer with the value t1;

   -   if prior to switch off, timer T3396 was running for a specific APN, because a PDN CONNECTIVITY
       REQUEST, BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST or BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION
       REQUEST message containing the low priority indicator set to "MS is configured for NAS signalling low
       priority" was rejected with timer T3396, and if timer T3396 is restarted at switch on, then the UE configured for
       dual priority shall handle session management requests as indicated in subclause 6.5.5; and

   -   if prior to switch off timer T3396 was running because a PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST without APN sent
       together with an ATTACH REQUEST message containing the low priority indicator set to "MS is configured for
       NAS signalling low priority" was rejected with timer T3396, and if timer T3396 is restarted at switch on, then
       the UE configured for dual priority shall handle session management requests as indicated in subclause 6.5.5.

If the T3396 IE is not included, the UE shall proceed with deactivation procedure and then send DEACTIVATE EPS
BEARER CONTEXT ACCEPT message.

Upon receipt of the DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER CONTEXT ACCEPT message, the MME shall enter the state
BEARER CONTEXT INACTIVE and stop the timer T3495.

6.4.4.4          Abnormal cases in the UE
The following abnormal case can be identified:

   a) UE is requested to deactivate a default EPS bearer context of the last PDN connection:

      If EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is not supported by the UE or the MME, and the UE
      determines that the EPS bearer indicated in the DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message
      is the default EPS bearer of the last PDN connection that the UE has, then the UE shall respond by performing a
      detach procedure. Additionally, the UE should perform an attach procedure.

      If EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is supported by the UE and the MME, the UE shall proceed
      with the deactivation procedure as specified in subclause 6.4.4.3.

   NOTE:     User interaction is necessary in some cases when the UE cannot re-activate the EPS bearer(s), if any,
             automatically.

6.4.4.5          Abnormal cases on the network side
The following abnormal cases can be identified:

   a) Expiry of timer T3495:

      On the first expiry of the timer T3495, the MME shall resend the DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER CONTEXT
      REQUEST and shall reset and restart timer T3495. This retransmission is repeated four times, i.e. on the fifth
      expiry of timer T3495, the MME shall abort the procedure and deactivate the EPS bearer context locally without
      any peer-to-peer ESM signalling between the MME and the UE.

   b) Collision of UE requested PDN disconnect procedure and EPS bearer context deactivation:

      When the MME receives a PDN DISCONNECT REQUEST message during the EPS bearer context deactivation
      procedure, and the EPS bearer indicated in the DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message
      is a dedicated EPS bearer belonging to the PDN connection the UE wants to disconnect, the MME shall proceed
      with both procedures. If the EPS bearer indicated in the DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST
      message is the default EPS bearer, the MME shall proceed with the EPS bearer context deactivation procedure.

6.4.4.6          Local EPS bearer context deactivation without NAS signalling
The UE and the MME deactivate EPS bearer contexts locally without peer-to-peer ESM signalling in the following
cases:

   1) during the service request procedure, if the E-UTRAN establishes the user plane radio bearers for one or more
      EPS bearer contexts but not for all the EPS bearer contexts, e.g. due to radio access control (see
      subclause 5.6.1.4 for details);

   1a) during the resume of NAS signalling connection procedure as specified in subclause 5.3.1.3, if one or more but
       not all the suspended user plane radio bearers are resumed;

   2) during the tracking area updating procedure with "active" flag, or without "active" flag but the network
      established the user plane radio bearers due to downlink pending data, if the E-UTRAN establishes the user
      plane radio bearers for one or more EPS bearer contexts but not for all the EPS bearer contexts indicated active
      by both UE and network;

   NOTE 1: The synchronisation of the EPS bearers, for which the user plane radio bearers need to be established,
           indicated in EPS bearer context status information element in TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT
           message is not applicable in item 2.

   3) during handover, if the target E-UTRAN does not establish all the user plane radio bearers for the UE;

   4) if the E-UTRAN releases one or more user plane radio bearers but not all the user plane radio bearers of the UE
      due to E-UTRAN specific reasons; or

   5) if triggered by an NBIFOM procedure (see 3GPP TS 24.161 [36]), for an NBIFOM multi-access PDN
      connection.

For cases 1) to 4), based on the indication from the lower layers, the UE and the MME shall locally deactivate the EPS
bearer contexts for which no user plane radio bearers are set up.

   NOTE 2: The above cases 1) to 4) do not apply for the UE when an RRC connection release occurs. The lower
           layers in the UE provide the user plane radio bearer context status to the ESM sublayer when a change in
           the user plane radio bearers is detected by the lower layers including establishment and release of user
           plane radio bearers for the UE in connected mode.

   NOTE 3: The above cases 1) to 4) do not apply for the MME when the S1 release procedure occurs as specified in
           3GPP TS 23.401 [10]).

If due to any of the cases described above the UE locally deactivates a default EPS bearer context, the UE shall locally
deactivate all EPS bearer contexts associated to the PDN connection with the default EPS bearer context.

If the UE locally deactivates the EPS bearer context(s) of the last remaining PDN connection, and EMM-
REGISTERED without PDN connection is not supported by the UE or the MME, the UE shall perform a local detach
and enter state EMM-DEREGISTERED. If this occurs during a service request procedure for CS fallback, the UE shall
reselect to GERAN or UTRAN and continue with the CS service, otherwise the UE shall initiate an attach procedure.

If the UE locally deactivates the EPS bearer context(s) of the last remaining PDN connection, and EMM-
REGISTERED without PDN connection is supported by the UE and the MME, the UE shall enter state EMM-
REGISTERED.

If the UE locally deactivates the EPS bearer context(s) of the last remaining PDN connection for non-emergency bearer
services and only the PDN connection for emergency bearer services remains established, the UE shall consider itself
attached for emergency bearer services only.

The MME shall deactivate the GBR EPS bearer contexts locally without peer-to-peer ESM signalling, when the MME
performs locally the release of the S1AP signalling connection due to the S1AP signalling connection is lost. All non-
GBR EPS bearers established are preserved in the MME and in the PDN GW.

If the E-UTRAN requests the MME to release the S1AP signalling connection, the MME shall deactivate or preserve
the GBR EPS bearer contexts according to 3GPP TS 23.401 [10], subclause 5.3.5. All non-GBR EPS bearer contexts
established are preserved in the MME and in the PDN GW.

   NOTE 4: The UE and the MME will synchronize the EPS bearer contexts subsequently during the next service
           request procedure, tracking area updating procedure or routing area updating procedure.

If due to any of the cases described above the MME locally deactivates a default EPS bearer context, the MME shall
locally deactivate all EPS bearer contexts associated to the PDN connection with the default EPS bearer context without
peer-to-peer ESM signalling to the UE.

If the MME locally deactivates the EPS bearer context(s) of the last remaining PDN connection, and EMM-
REGISTERED without PDN connection is not supported by the UE or the MME, the MME shall perform a local detach
and enter state EMM-DEREGISTERED.

If the MME locally deactivates the EPS bearer context(s) of the last remaining PDN connection, and EMM-
REGISTERED without PDN connection is supported by the UE and the MME, the MME shall enter state EMM-
REGISTERED.

For EPS bearer context deactivation procedure initiated by the network, if no NAS signalling connection exists, the
MME locally deactivates the EPS bearer context(s) without peer-to-peer ESM signalling In the case of reactivation
requested, the MME can perform this local deactivation only when the EMM-entity in the network was unable to re-
establish the NAS signalling connection. The EPS bearer context deactivation procedure is not initiated by the network
when the MME disconnects the UE from the last remaining PDN to which it is connected and EMM-REGISTERED
without PDN connection is not supported by the UE or the MME. In this case, the MME initiates a network initiated
detach procedure.

If the MME locally deactivates the EPS bearer context(s) of the last remaining PDN connection for non-emergency
bearer services and only the PDN connection for emergency bearer services remains established for the UE, the MME
shall consider the UE to be attached for emergency bearer services only.

6.5           UE requested ESM procedures
6.5.0         General
The UE's maximum number of active EPS bearer contexts in a PLMN is determined by whichever is the lowest of the
maximum number of EPS bearer identities allowed by the protocol (as specified in 3GPP TS 24.007 [12]
subclause 11.2.3.1.5), the PLMN's maximum number of EPS bearer contexts in S1 mode and the UE's implementation-
specific maximum number of EPS bearer contexts.

   NOTE 1: Subclauses 6.5.1.4 and 6.5.3.4 specify how the UE determines the PLMN's maximum number of EPS
           bearer contexts in S1 mode.

In earlier versions of the protocol, the maximum number of simultaneously active EPS bearer contexts was limited by
lower layer protocols to 8.

In the present version of the protocol, the UE and the network may support a maximum number of 15 EPS bearer
contexts.

A UE supporting signalling for a maximum number of 15 EPS bearer contexts shall support the extended range or EPS
bearer identities from 0 to 15 (as specified in 3GPP TS 24.007 [12] subclause 11.2.3.1.5). The UE indicates support of
signalling for a maximum number of 15 EPS bearer contexts by setting the 15 bearers bit in the UE Network Capability
IE.

A network supporting signalling for a maximum number of 15 EPS bearer contexts shall support the extended range or
EPS bearer identities from 0 to 15 (as specified in 3GPP TS 24.007 [12] subclause 11.2.3.1.5). The network indicates
support of signalling for a maximum number of 15 EPS bearer contexts by setting the 15 bearers bit in the EPS network
feature support IE.

   NOTE 2: A UE and a network not supporting signalling for a maximum number of 15 EPS bearer contexts will
           treat the EPS bearer identity values 1 to 4 as 'reserved' values.


6.5.1         UE requested PDN connectivity procedure

6.5.1.1          General
The purpose of the UE requested PDN connectivity procedure is for a UE to request the setup of a default EPS bearer to
a PDN. The UE requests connectivity to a PDN by sending a PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message to the
network. If accepted by the network, this procedure initiates the establishment of a default EPS bearer context. If EMM-
REGISTERED without PDN connection is not supported by the UE or the MME, the procedure is used either to
establish the first default bearer by including the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message into the initial attach
message, or to establish subsequent default bearers to additional PDNs in order to allow the UE simultaneous access to
multiple PDNs by sending the message stand-alone. If EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is supported by
the UE and the MME, the procedure is used to establish the first or subsequent default bearers to a PDN or additional
PDNs by sending the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message stand-alone.

If the UE requests PDN connectivity for emergency bearer services, the MME shall not check for regional restrictions
or subscription restrictions when processing the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message.

If there is already a PDN connection for emergency bearer services established, the UE shall not request an additional
PDN connection for emergency bearer services.

A UE attached for emergency bearer services shall not request a PDN connection to any other PDN.

The UE may also initiate the UE requested PDN connectivity procedure to add 3GPP access to the PDN connection
which is already established over WLAN as specified in the subclause 6.2.2 of 3GPP TS 23.161 [34].

The UE may also initiate the UE requested PDN connectivity procedure to transfer an existing PDU session in the 5GS
to EPS as specified in 3GPP TS 24.501 [54].

If the UE supports the device triggering short message as specified in 3GPP TS 23.040 [57] and supports non-IP PDN
type, then upon receiving from ESMS entity as specified in 3GPP TS 24.007 [12] an indication requesting
establishment of a PDN connection for non-IP PDN type using the default APN as specified in 3GPP TS 24.011 [13A],

the UE shall initiate the UE requested PDN connectivity procedure in order to request connectivity to a PDN using the
default APN and non-IP PDN type.

6.5.1.2          UE requested PDN connectivity procedure initiation
In order to request connectivity to a PDN, the UE shall send a PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message to the
MME, start timer T3482 and enter the state PROCEDURE TRANSACTION PENDING (see example in
figure 6.5.1.2.1).

When the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message is sent together with an ATTACH REQUEST message, the UE
shall not start timer T3482 and shall not include the APN.

   NOTE 1: If the UE needs to provide protocol configuration options which require ciphering or provide an APN, or
           both, during the attach procedure, the ESM information transfer flag is included in the PDN
           CONNECTIVITY REQUEST. The MME then at a later stage in the PDN connectivity procedure initiates
           the ESM information request procedure in which the UE can provide the MME with protocol
           configuration options or APN or both.

In order to request a PDN connection for emergency bearer services, the UE shall not include an APN in the PDN
CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message or, when applicable, in the ESM INFORMATION RESPONSE message.

In order to request connectivity to a PDN using the default APN, the UE includes the access point name IE in the PDN
CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message or, when applicable, in the ESM INFORMATION RESPONSE message,
according to the following conditions:

   -   if use of a PDN using the default APN requires PAP/CHAP, then the UE should include the Access point name
       IE; and

   -   in all other conditions, the UE need not include the Access point name IE.

In order to request connectivity to an additional PDN using a specific APN, the UE shall include the requested APN in
the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message.

In the PDN type IE the UE shall either indicate the IP version capability of the IP stack associated with the UE or non
IP as specified in subclause 6.2.2.

If the PDN type value of the PDN type IE is set to IPv4 or IPv6 or IPv4v6 and the UE indicates "Control plane CIoT
EPS optimization supported" in the UE network capability IE of the ATTACH REQUEST message, the UE may
include the Header compression configuration IE in the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message.

The UE shall set the request type to "initial request" when the UE is establishing a new PDN connectivity to a PDN in
an attach procedure or in a stand-alone PDN connectivity procedure. The UE shall set the request type to "emergency"
when the UE is requesting a new PDN connectivity for emergency bearer services. The UE shall set the request type to
"handover" when the connectivity to a PDN is to be transferred from a non-3GPP access network to the 3GPP access
network, or when the UE initiates the procedure to add 3GPP access to the PDN connection which is already
established over WLAN. The UE shall set the request type to "handover of emergency bearer services" when a PDN
connection for emergency bearer services is to be transferred from a WLAN to the 3GPP access network.

If the UE supports DSMIPv6, the UE may include a request for obtaining the IPv6 address and optionally the IPv4
address of the home agent in the Protocol configuration options IE in the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message.
The UE may also include a request for obtaining the IPv6 Home Network Prefix. The UE shall request the IPv6 Home
Network Prefix only if the UE has requested the home agent IPv6 address. The requested home agent address(es) and
the Home Network Prefix are related to the APN the UE requested connectivity for.

The UE may set the ESM information transfer flag in the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message to indicate that it
has ESM information, i.e. protocol configuration options, APN, or both, that needs to be sent after the NAS signalling
security has been activated between the UE and the MME.

If the UE supports A/Gb mode or Iu mode or both, the UE shall indicate the support of the network requested bearer
control procedures (see 3GPP TS 24.008 [13]) in A/Gb mode or Iu mode in the protocol configuration options IE.

If the UE supports N1 mode and the request type is:

   a) "initial request" or "emergency", the UE shall generate a PDU session ID, associate the PDU session ID with the
      PDN connection that is being established, and include the PDU session ID in the protocol configuration options
      IE or the extended protocol configuration options IE;

   b) "handover" or "handover of emergency bearer services", and the UE requests:

       1) transfer of an existing PDU session in 5GS, the UE shall associate the PDU session ID of the PDU session
          with the PDN connection that is being established for the existing PDU session and include the PDU session
          ID in the protocol configuration options IE or the extended protocol configuration options IE; or

       2) transfer of an existing PDN connection in a non-3GPP access connected to the EPC and a PDU session ID is
          associated with the existing PDN connection, the UE shall include the PDU session ID in the protocol
          configuration options IE or the extended protocol configuration options IE.

If the UE supporting N1 mode supports receiving QoS rules with the length of two octets or QoS flow descriptions with
the length of two octets via the extended protocol configuration options IE, the UE shall include the QoS rules with the
length of two octets support indicator or the QoS flow descriptions with the length of two octets support indicator,
respectively, in the protocol configuration options IE or the extended protocol configuration options IE.

Protocol configuration options provided in the ESM INFORMATION RESPONSE message replace any protocol
configuration options provided in the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message.

When the UE initiates the procedure to add 3GPP access to the PDN connection that is already established over WLAN,
the UE shall provide the same APN as that of the PDN connection established over WLAN in the PDN connectivity
procedure as specified in the subclause 6.2.2 of 3GPP TS 23.161 [34].

If the UE supports APN rate control, the UE shall include an APN rate control support indicator and an additional APN
rate control for exception data support indicator in the protocol configuration options IE or extended protocol
configuration options IE.

6.5.1.3          UE requested PDN connectivity procedure accepted by the network
Upon receipt of the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message, the MME checks whether the ESM information
transfer flag is included. If the flag is included the MME waits for completion of the ESM information request
procedure before proceeding with the PDN connectivity procedure. The MME then checks if connectivity with the
requested PDN can be established. If no requested APN is included in the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message
or the ESM INFORMATION RESPONSE message and the request type is different from "emergency" and from
"handover of emergency bearer services", the MME shall use the default APN as the requested APN. If the request type
is "emergency" or "handover of emergency bearer services", the MME shall use the APN configured for emergency
bearer services or select the statically configured PDN GW for unauthenticated UEs, if applicable.

If the network receives a PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message with the same combination of APN and PDN
type as an already existing PDN connection, and multiple PDN connections for a given APN are allowed, the network
retains the existing EPS bearer contexts for the PDN connection and proceeds with the requested PDN connectivity
procedure.

If the lower layers provide a GW Transport Layer Address value identifying a L-GW together with the PDN
CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message and a PDN connection is established as a LIPA PDN connection due to the
PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message, then the MME shall store the GW Transport Layer Address value as the
P-GW address in the EPS bearer context of the LIPA PDN connection.

If the lower layers provide a SIPTO L-GW Transport Layer Address value identifying a L-GW together with the PDN
CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message and a PDN connection is established as a SIPTO at the local network PDN
connection due to the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message, then the MME shall store the SIPTO L-GW
Transport Layer Address value as the P-GW address in the EPS bearer context of the SIPTO at the local network PDN
connection.

If the lower layers provide a LHN-ID value together with the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message and a PDN
connection is established as a SIPTO at the local network PDN connection due to the PDN CONNECTIVITY
REQUEST message, then the MME shall store the LHN-ID value in the EPS bearer context of the SIPTO at the local
network PDN connection.

   NOTE:      The receipt of a LHN-ID value during the establishment of the PDN connection, during tracking area
              updating procedure or during inter-MME handover can be used as an indication by the MME that the
              SIPTO at the local nework PDN connection is established to a stand-alone GW (see
              3GPP TS 23.401 [10]).

If connectivity with the requested PDN is accepted by the network, the MME shall initiate the default EPS bearer
context activation procedure (see subclause 6.4.1).

If connectivity with the requested PDN is accepted and the network considers this PDN connection a LIPA PDN
connection, then subject to operator policy the MME shall include in the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER
CONTEXT REQUEST message the Connectivity type IE indicating "the PDN connection is considered a LIPA PDN
connection".

If connectivity with the requested PDN is accepted, but with a restriction of IP version (i.e. both an IPv4 address and an
IPv6 prefix is requested, but only one particular IP version, or only single IP version bearers are supported/allowed by
the network), ESM cause #50 "PDN type IPv4 only allowed", #51 "PDN type IPv6 only allowed", or #52 "single
address bearers only allowed", respectively, shall be included in the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER
CONTEXT REQUEST message.

If connectivity with the requested PDN is accepted and the UE provided the Header compression configuration IE in the
PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message, the MME may include the Header compression configuration IE in the
ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message. Furthermore, if the MME decides that the
associated PDN connection is only for control plane CIoT EPS optimization (see subclause 5.3.15), the MME shall
include the Control plane only indication in the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST
message.

Upon receipt of the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message, the UE shall stop timer
T3482 and enter the state PROCEDURE TRANSACTION INACTIVE. The UE should ensure that the procedure
transaction identity (PTI) assigned to this procedure is not released immediately. The way to achieve this is
implementation dependent. While the PTI value is not released, the UE regards any received ACTIVATE DEFAULT
EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message with the same PTI value as a network retransmission (see
subclause 7.3.1).

Upon receipt of the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message with the Connectivity type
IE indicating "the PDN connection is considered a LIPA PDN connection", the UE provides an indication to the upper
layers that the connectivity is provided by a LIPA PDN connection.

Upon receipt of the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message, if the 3GPP PS data off
UE status is "activated", the UE behaves as described in subclause 6.3.10.

Upon receipt of the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message, if the SCEF or P-GW
indicates acceptance of use of Reliable Data Service to transfer data for the PDN connection, the UE behaves as
described in subclause 6.3.11.

Upon receipt of the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message, if an S-NSSAI and the
PLMN ID that this S-NSSAI relates to are provided in the protocol configuration options IE or extended protocol
configuration options IE, the UE shall store the S-NSSAI and the associated PLMN ID along with the corresponding
PDU session ID that the UE provided in the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message. The usage of the PDU
session ID and the corresponding S-NSSAI with the associated PLMN ID is specified in 3GPP TS 24.501 [54].

Upon receipt of the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message with a session-AMBR and
QoS rule(s), which correspond to the default EPS bearer of the PDN connectivity being activated, in the protocol
configuration options IE or the extended protocol configuration options IE, the UE stores the session-AMBR and QoS
rule(s) for use during inter-system change from S1 mode to N1 mode.

6.5.1.4          UE requested PDN connectivity procedure not accepted by the network

6.5.1.4.1            General
If connectivity with the requested PDN cannot be accepted by the network, the MME shall send a PDN
CONNECTIVITY REJECT message to the UE. The message shall contain the PTI and an ESM cause value indicating
the reason for rejecting the UE requested PDN connectivity.

The ESM cause IE typically indicates one of the following ESM cause values:

   #8: operator determined barring;

   #26:   insufficient resources;

   #27:   missing or unknown APN;

   #28:   unknown PDN type;

   #29:   user authentication or authorization failed;

   #30:   request rejected by Serving GW or PDN GW;

   #31:   request rejected, unspecified;

   #32:   service option not supported;

   #33:   requested service option not subscribed;

   #34:   service option temporarily out of order;

   #35:   PTI already in use;

   #38:   network failure;

   #50:   PDN type IPv4 only allowed;

   #51:   PDN type IPv6 only allowed;

   #53:   ESM information not received;

   #54:   PDN connection does not exist;

   #55:   multiple PDN connections for a given APN not allowed;

   #57:   PDN type IPv4v6 only allowed;

   #58:   PDN type non IP only allowed;

   #65:   maximum number of EPS bearers reached;

   #66:   requested APN not supported in current RAT and PLMN combination;

   #95 – 111:    protocol errors;

   #112: APN restriction value incompatible with active EPS bearer context;

   #113: Multiple accesses to a PDN connection not allowed.

The network may include a Back-off timer value IE in the PDN CONNECTIVITY REJECT message. If the ESM cause
value is #26 "insufficient resources" and the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message was received via a NAS
signalling connection established with RRC establishment cause "High priority access AC 11 – 15" or the request type
in the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message was set to "emergency" or "handover of emergency bearer
services", the network shall not include a Back-off timer value IE.

If the Back-off timer value IE is included and the ESM cause value is different from #26 "insufficient resources", #50
"PDN type IPv4 only allowed", #51 "PDN type IPv6 only allowed", #57 "PDN type IPv4v6 only allowed", #58 "PDN
type non IP only allowed" and #65 "maximum number of EPS bearers reached", the network may include the Re-
attempt indicator IE to indicate whether the UE is allowed to attempt a PDP context activation procedure in the PLMN
for the same APN in A/Gb or Iu mode, and whether another attempt in A/Gb and Iu mode or in S1 mode is allowed in
an equivalent PLMN.

If the ESM cause value is #50 "PDN type IPv4 only allowed", #51 "PDN type IPv6 only allowed", #57 "PDN type
IPv4v6 only allowed" or #58 "PDN type non IP only allowed", the network may include the Re-attempt indicator IE
without Back-off timer value IE to indicate whether the UE is allowed to attempt a PDN connectivity procedure in an
equivalent PLMN for the same APN in S1 mode using the same PDN type.

If the ESM cause value is #66 "requested APN not supported in current RAT and PLMN combination", the network
may include the Re-attempt indicator IE without Back-off timer value IE to indicate whether the UE is allowed to
attempt a PDN connectivity procedure in an equivalent PLMN for the same APN in S1 mode.

Upon receipt of the PDN CONNECTIVITY REJECT message, the UE shall stop timer T3482 and enter the state
PROCEDURE TRANSACTION INACTIVE.

If the PDN CONNECTIVITY REJECT message is due to an ESM failure notified by EMM layer (i.e., EMM cause #19
"ESM failure" included in an ATTACH REJECT message), the UE may include a different APN in the PDN
CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message.

   NOTE 1: When receiving EMM cause #19 "ESM failure", coordination is required between the EMM and ESM
           sublayers in the UE to notify the ESM failure.

If the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message was sent with request type set to "emergency" or "handover of
emergency bearer services" in a stand-alone PDN connectivity procedure and the UE receives a PDN
CONNECTIVITY REJECT message, then the UE may:

   a) inform the upper layers of the failure to establish the emergency bearer; or

   NOTE 2: This can result in the upper layers requesting establishment of a CS emergency call (if not already
           attempted in the CS domain) or other implementation specific mechanisms, e.g. procedures specified in
           3GPP TS 24.229 [13D] can result in the emergency call being attempted to another IP-CAN.

   b) detach locally, if not detached already, attempt EPS attach for emergency bearer services.

6.5.1.4.2            Handling of network rejection due to ESM cause #26
If the ESM cause value is #26 "insufficient resources" and the Back-off timer value IE is included, the UE shall ignore
the Re-attempt indicator IE provided by the network, if any, and behave as follows:

   1) if the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message was sent standalone, the UE shall take different actions
      depending on the timer value received for timer T3396 in the Back-off timer value IE (if the UE is configured
      for dual priority, exceptions are specified in subclause 6.5.5; if the UE is a UE configured to use AC11 – 15 in
      selected PLMN, exceptions are specified in subclause 6.3.5):

       i) if the timer value indicates neither zero nor deactivated and an APN was included in the PDN
          CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message, the UE shall stop timer T3396 associated with the corresponding
          APN, if it is running. If the timer value indicates neither zero nor deactivated, no APN was included in the
          PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message and the request type was different from "emergency" and from
          "handover of emergency bearer services", the UE shall stop timer T3396 associated with no APN if it is
          running. The UE shall then start timer T3396 with the value provided in the Back-off timer value IE and:

         -   shall not send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST, BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION
             REQUEST with exception of those identified in subclause 6.5.4.1, or BEARER RESOURCE
             ALLOCATION REQUEST message for the same APN that was sent by the UE, until timer T3396
             expires or timer T3396 is stopped; and

         -   shall not send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message without an APN and with request
             type different from "emergency" and from "handover of emergency bearer services", or another BEARER
             RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST with exception of those identified in subclause 6.5.4.1, or
             BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST for a non-emergency PDN connection established
             without an APN provided by the UE, if no APN was included in the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST
             message and the request type was different from "emergency" and from "handover of emergency bearer
             services", until timer T3396 expires or timer T3396 is stopped.

         The UE shall not stop timer T3396 upon a PLMN change or inter-system change;

      ii) if the timer value indicates that this timer is deactivated, the UE:

         -   shall not send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST, BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION
             REQUEST with exception of those identified in subclause 6.5.4.1, or BEARER RESOURCE
             ALLOCATION REQUEST message for the same APN until the UE is switched off or the USIM is
             removed, or the UE receives an ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST,
             ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST or MODIFY EPS BEARER
             CONTEXT REQUEST message for the same APN from the network or a DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER
             CONTEXT REQUEST message including ESM cause #39 "reactivation requested" for a default EPS
             bearer context for the same APN from the network; and

         -   shall not send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message without an APN and with request
             type different from "emergency" and from "handover of emergency bearer services", or another BEARER
             RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST with exception of those identified in subclause 6.5.4.1, or
             BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST message for a non-emergency PDN connection
             established without an APN provided by the UE, if no APN was included in the PDN CONNECTIVITY
             REQUEST message and the request type was different from "emergency" and from "handover of
             emergency bearer services", until the UE is switched off or the USIM is removed, or the UE receives an
             ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST, ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS
             BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST or MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message for a
             non-emergency PDN connection established without an APN provided by the UE, or a DEACTIVATE
             EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message including ESM cause #39 "reactivation requested" for a
             default EPS bearer context of a non-emergency PDN connection established without an APN provided by
             the UE.

         The timer T3396 remains deactivated upon a PLMN change or inter-system change; and

      iii) if the timer value indicates zero, the UE:

         -   shall stop timer T3396 associated with the corresponding APN, if running, and may send another PDN
             CONNECTIVITY REQUEST, BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST or BEARER
             RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST message for the same APN; and

         -   if no APN was included in the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message and the request type was
             different from "emergency" and from "handover of emergency bearer services", the UE shall stop timer
             T3396 associated with no APN, if running, and may send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST
             message without an APN, or another BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST or BEARER
             RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST message for a non-emergency PDN connection established
             without an APN provided by the UE; and

   2) if the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message was sent together with an ATTACH REQUEST, the UE shall
      take different actions depending on the timer value received for timer T3396 in the Back-off timer value IE and
      on the integrity protection of the ATTACH REJECT message (if the UE is configured for dual priority,
      exceptions are specified in subclause 6.5.5; if the UE is a UE configured to use AC11 – 15 in selected PLMN,
      exceptions are specified in subclause 6.3.5):

      i) if the ATTACH REJECT message is not integrity protected and an APN was sent by the UE during the
         attach procedure, the UE shall stop timer T3396 associated with the corresponding APN if it is running. If the
         ATTACH REJECT message is not integrity protected, the request type was different from "emergency" and

         from "handover of emergency bearer services", and an APN was not sent by the UE, the UE shall stop timer
         T3396 associated with no APN if it is running. The UE shall then start timer T3396 with a random value
         from a default range specified in table 11.2.3 defined in 3GPP TS 24.008 [13], and:

         a) shall not initiate a new attach procedure with the same APN or send another PDN CONNECTIVITY
            REQUEST with the same APN that was sent by the UE, until timer T3396 expires or timer T3396 is
            stopped; and

         b) shall not initiate a new attach procedure without an APN and with request type different from
            "emergency" and from "handover of emergency bearer services" or send another PDN CONNECTIVITY
            REQUEST without an APN and with request type different from "emergency" and from "handover of

         a) if the timer value indicates neither zero nor deactivated and an APN was sent by the UE during the attach
            procedure, the UE shall stop timer T3396 associated with the corresponding APN if it is running. If the
            timer value indicates neither zero nor deactivated, the request type was different from "emergency" and
            from "handover of emergency bearer services", and an APN was not sent by the UE during the attach
            procedure, the UE shall stop timer T3396 associated with no APN if it is running. The UE shall then start
            timer T3396 with the value provided in the Back-off timer value IE and:

            -   shall not initiate a new attach procedure with the same APN or send another PDN CONNECTIVITY
                REQUEST with the same APN that was sent by the UE, until timer T3396 expires or timer T3396 is
                stopped; and

            -   shall not initiate a new attach procedure without an APN and with request type different from
                "emergency" and from "handover of emergency bearer services" or send another PDN
                CONNECTIVITY REQUEST without an APN and with request type different from "emergency" and

                procedure and the request type was different from "emergency" and from "handover of emergency
                bearer services", until timer T3396 expires.

            The UE shall not stop timer T3396 upon a PLMN change or inter-system change;

         b) if the timer value indicates that this timer is deactivated, the UE:

            -   shall not initiate a new attach procedure with the same APN or send another PDN CONNECTIVITY
                REQUEST with the same APN that was sent by the UE, until the UE is switched off or the USIM is
                removed, or the UE receives an ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST
                message for the same APN from the network; and

            -   shall not initiate a new attach procedure without an APN and with request type different from
                "emergency" and from "handover of emergency bearer services" or send another PDN
                CONNECTIVITY REQUEST without an APN and with request type different from "emergency" and
                from "handover of emergency bearer services", if the UE did not provide any APN during the attach
                procedure and the request type was different from "emergency" and from "handover of emergency
                bearer services", until the UE is switched off or the USIM is removed, or the UE receives an
                ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message for a non-emergency PDN
                connection established without an APN provided by the UE.

            The timer T3396 remains deactivated upon a PLMN change or inter-system change; and

         c) if the timer value indicates that this timer is zero, the UE shall proceed as specified in subclause 5.5.1.2.6
            item d.

If the Back-off timer value IE is not included and the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST was sent standalone, then the
UE may send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST, BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST or
BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST message for the same APN.

When the timer T3396 is running or the timer is deactivated, the UE is allowed to initiate an attach procedure or PDN
connectivity procedure if the procedure is for emergency bearer services.

If the timer T3396 is running when the UE enters state EMM-DEREGISTERED, the UE remains switched on, and the
USIM in the UE remains the same, then timer T3396 is kept running until it expires or it is stopped.

If the UE is switched off when the timer T3396 is running, and if the USIM in the UE remains the same when the UE is
switched on, the UE shall behave as follows:

   -   let t1 be the time remaining for T3396 timeout at switch off and let t be the time elapsed between switch off and
       switch on. If t1 is greater than t, then the timer shall be restarted with the value t1 – t. If t1 is equal to or less than
       t, then the timer need not be restarted. If the UE is not capable of determining t, then the UE shall restart the
       timer with the value t1;

   -   if prior to switch off, timer T3396 was running for a specific APN, because a PDN CONNECTIVITY
       REQUEST, BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST or BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION
       REQUEST message containing the low priority indicator set to "MS is configured for NAS signalling low
       priority" was rejected with a timer value for timer T3396, and if timer T3396 is restarted at switch on, then the
       UE configured for dual priority shall handle session management requests as indicated in subclause 6.5.5; and

   -   if prior to switch off timer T3396 was running because a PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST without APN sent
       together with an ATTACH REQUEST message containing the low priority indicator set to "MS is configured for
       NAS signalling low priority" was rejected with a timer value for timer T3396, and if timer T3396 is restarted at
       switch on, then the UE configured for dual priority shall handle session management requests as indicated in
       subclause 6.5.5.

6.5.1.4.3             Handling of network rejection due to ESM cause other than ESM cause #26
If the ESM cause value is different from #26 "insufficient resources", #50 "PDN type IPv4 only allowed", #51 "PDN
type IPv6 only allowed", #54 "PDN connection does not exist", #57 "PDN type IPv4v6 only allowed", #58 "PDN type
non IP only allowed", #65 "maximum number of EPS bearers reached", and #66 "requested APN not supported in
current RAT and PLMN combination", and the Back-off timer value IE is included, the UE shall behave as follows:

   1) if the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message was sent standalone, the UE shall take different actions
      depending on the timer value received in the Back-off timer value IE (if the UE is a UE configured to use
      AC11 – 15 in selected PLMN, exceptions are specified in subclause 6.3.6):

       i) if the timer value indicates neither zero nor deactivated, the UE shall start the back-off timer with the value
          provided in the Back-off timer value IE for the PDN connectivity procedure and PLMN and APN
          combination and

          -   shall not send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message in the PLMN for the same APN that
              was sent by the UE, until the back-off timer expires, the UE is switched off or the USIM is removed; and

          -   shall not send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message in the PLMN without an APN and
              with request type different from "emergency" and from "handover of emergency bearer services" if no
              APN was included in the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message, until the back-off timer expires,
              the UE is switched off or the USIM is removed;

       ii) if the timer value indicates that this timer is deactivated, the UE:

          -   shall not send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message in the PLMN for the same APN until
              the UE is switched off or the USIM is removed; and

          -   shall not send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message in the PLMN without an APN and
              with request type different from "emergency" and from "handover of emergency bearer services" if no
              APN was included in the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message, until the UE is switched off or the
              USIM is removed; and

       iii) if the timer value indicates zero, the UE:

          -   may send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message in the PLMN for the same APN; and

          -   may send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message in the PLMN without an APN; and

   2) if the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message was sent together with an ATTACH REQUEST, the UE shall
      take different actions depending on the timer value received in the Back-off timer value IE and on the integrity
      protection of the ATTACH REJECT message (if the UE is a UE configured to use AC11 – 15 in selected
      PLMN, exceptions are specified in subclause 6.3.6):

      i) if the ATTACH REJECT message is not integrity protected, the UE shall start the back-off timer with a
         random value from a default range specified in table 11.2.3(see 3GPP TS 24.008 [13]), and:

          a) shall not initiate a new attach procedure or send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message in
             the PLMN with the same APN that was sent by the UE, until the back-off timer expires, the UE is
             switched off or the USIM is removed; and

          b) shall not initiate a new attach procedure or send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message in
             the PLMN without an APN and with request type different from "emergency" and from "handover of
             emergency bearer services", if the UE did not provide any APN during the attach procedure and the
             request type was different from "emergency", until the back-off timer expires, the UE is switched off or
             the USIM is removed; and

      ii) if the ATTACH REJECT message is integrity protected, the UE shall proceed as follows:

          a) if the timer value indicates neither zero nor deactivated, the UE shall start the back-off timer with the
             value provided in the Back-off timer value IE for the PDN connectivity procedure and PLMN and APN
             combination and:

             -   shall not initiate a new attach procedure or send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message
                 in the PLMN with the same APN that was sent by the UE, until the back-off timer expires, the UE is
                 switched off or the USIM is removed; and

             -   shall not initiate a new attach procedure or send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message
                 in the PLMN without an APN and with request type different from "emergency" and from "handover
                 of emergency bearer services", if the UE did not provide any APN during the attach procedure and the
                 request type was different from "emergency" and from "handover of emergency bearer services", until
                 the back-off timer expires, the UE is switched off or the USIM is removed;

          b) if the timer value indicates that this timer is deactivated, the UE:

             -   shall not initiate a new attach procedure or send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message
                 in the PLMN with the same APN that was sent by the UE, until the UE is switched off or the USIM is
                 removed; and

             -   shall not initiate a new attach procedure or send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message
                 in the PLMN without an APN and with request type different from "emergency" and from "handover
                 of emergency bearer services", if the UE did not provide any APN during the attach procedure and the
                 request type was different from "emergency" and from "handover of emergency bearer services", until
                 the UE is switched off or the USIM is removed; and

          c) if the timer value indicates that this timer is zero, the UE shall proceed as specified in subclause 5.5.1.2.6
             item d.

If the Back-off timer value IE is not included and the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST was sent standalone, then the
UE shall ignore the Re-attempt indicator IE provided by the network in PDN CONNECTIVITY REJECT, if any.

   1) Additionally, if the ESM cause value is #8 "operator determined barring", #27 "missing or unknown APN", #32
      "service option not supported", or #33 "requested service option not subscribed", the UE shall proceed as
      follows:

      -   if the UE is registered in the HPLMN or in a PLMN that is within the EHPLMN list, the UE shall behave as
          described above in the present subclause, using the configured SM_RetryWaitTime value as specified in
          3GPP TS 24.368 [15A] or in USIM file NASCONFIG as specified in 3GPP TS 31.102 [17], if available, as
          back-off timer value; and

      -   otherwise, if the UE is not registered in its HPLMN or in a PLMN that is within the EHPLMN list, or if the
          SM_RetryWaitTime value is not configured, the UE shall behave as described above in the present
          subclause, using the default value of 12 minutes for the back-off timer.




                                                           ETSI
3GPP TS 24.301 version 15.8.0 Release 15                   267                       ETSI TS 124 301 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


   2) For ESM cause values different from #8 "operator determined barring", #27 "missing or unknown APN", #32
      "service option not supported", or #33 "requested service option not subscribed", the UE behaviour regarding the
      start of a back-off timer is unspecified.

The UE shall not stop any back-off timer upon a PLMN change or inter-system change. If the network indicates that a
back-off timer for the PDN connectivity procedure and PLMN and APN combination is deactivated, then it remains
deactivated upon a PLMN change or inter-system change.

   NOTE 1: This means the back-off timer can still be running or be deactivated for the given ESM procedure and
           PLMN and APN combination when the UE returns to the PLMN or when it performs inter-system change
           back from A/Gb or Iu mode to S1 mode. Thus the UE can still be prevented from sending another PDN
           CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message in the PLMN for the same APN.

If the Back-off timer value IE is not included and the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST was sent together with an
ATTACH REQUEST, the UE shall ignore the Re-attempt indicator IE provided by the network in PDN
CONNECTIVITY REJECT, if any, and proceed as specified in subclause 5.5.1.2.6, item d.

If the back-off timer is started upon receipt of a PDN CONNECTIVITY REJECT (i.e. the timer value was provided by
the network, a configured value is available or the default value is used as explained above) or the back-off timer is
deactivated, the UE behaves as follows:

   1) after a PLMN change the UE may send a PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message for the same APN in the
      new PLMN, if the back-off timer is not running and is not deactivated for the PDN connectivity procedure and
      the combination of new PLMN and APN;

       Furthermore as an implementation option, for the ESM cause values #8 "operator determined barring", #27
       "missing or unknown APN", #32 "service option not supported" or #33 "requested service option not
       subscribed", if the network does not include a Re-attempt indicator IE, the UE may decide not to automatically
       send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message for the same APN that was sent by the UE using the
       same PDN type, or the UE may decide not to automatically send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST
       message included in an ATTACH REQUEST message without an APN using the same PDN type if the UE did
       not provide any APN in the PDN connectivity procedure, if the UE is registered to a new PLMN which is in the
       list of equivalent PLMNs.

   2) if the network does not include the Re-attempt indicator IE to indicate whether re-attempt in A/Gb or Iu mode is
      allowed, or the UE ignores the Re-attempt indicator IE, e.g. because the Back-off timer value IE is not included,
      then:

       -   if the UE is registered in its HPLMN or in a PLMN that is within the EHPLMN list, the UE shall apply the
           configured SM_RetryAtRATChange value as specified in 3GPP TS 24.368 [15A] or in USIM file
           NASCONFIG as specified in 3GPP TS 31.102 [17], if available, to determine whether the UE may attempt a
           PDP context activation procedure for the same PLMN and APN combination in A/Gb or Iu mode; and

       -   if the UE is not registered in its HPLMN or in a PLMN that is within the EHPLMN list, or if the NAS
           configuration MO as specified in 3GPP TS 24.368 [15A] is not available and the value for inter-system
           change is not configured in the USIM file NASCONFIG, then the UE behaviour regarding a PDP context
           activation procedure for the same PLMN and APN combination in A/Gb or Iu mode is unspecified; and

   3) if the network includes the Re-attempt indicator IE indicating that re-attempt in an equivalent PLMN is not
      allowed, then depending on the timer value received in the Back-off timer value IE, for each combination of a
      PLMN from the equivalent PLMN list and the APN the UE shall start a back-off timer for the PDP connectivity
      procedure with the value provided by the network, or deactivate the respective back-off timer as follows:

       -   If the Re-attempt indicator IE additionally indicates that re-attempt in A/Gb or Iu mode is allowed, the UE
           shall start or deactivate the back-off timer for S1 mode only; and

       -   otherwise the UE shall start or deactivate the back-off timer for A/Gb, Iu, and S1 mode.

If the back-off timer for a PLMN and APN combination was started or deactivated in A/Gb or Iu mode upon receipt of
an ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REJECT message (see 3GPP TS 24.008 [13]) and the network indicated that re-
attempt in S1 mode is allowed, then this back-off timer does not prevent the UE from sending a PDN CONNECTIVITY
REQUEST message in this PLMN for the same APN after inter-system change to S1 mode. If the network indicated
that re-attempt in S1 mode is not allowed, the UE shall not send any PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message in

3GPP TS 24.301 version 15.8.0 Release 15                  268                       ETSI TS 124 301 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


this PLMN for the same APN after inter-system change to S1 mode until the timer expires, the UE is switched off or the
USIM is removed.

   NOTE 2: The back-off timer is used to describe a logical model of the required UE behaviour. This model does not
           imply any specific implementation, e.g. as a timer or timestamp.

   NOTE 3: Reference to back-off timer in this section can either refer to use of timer T3396 or to use of a different
           packet system specific timer within the UE. Whether the UE uses T3396 as a back-off timer or it uses
           different packet system specific timers as back-off timers is left up to UE implementation. This back-off
           timer is stopped when the UE is switched off or the USIM is removed.

When the back-off timer is running or the timer is deactivated, the UE is allowed to initiate an attach procedure or PDN
connectivity procedure if the procedure is for emergency bearer services.

If the ESM cause value is #50 "PDN type IPv4 only allowed", #51 "PDN type IPv6 only allowed", #57 "PDN type
IPv4v6 only allowed" or #58 "PDN type non IP only allowed", the UE shall ignore the Back-off timer value IE
provided by the network, if any. The UE shall not automatically send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST
message for the same APN that was sent by the UE using the same PDN type until any of the following conditions is
fulfilled:

   -   the UE is registered to a new PLMN, and either the network did not include a Re-attempt indicator IE in the
       PDN CONNECTIVITY REJECT message or the Re-attempt indicator IE included in the message indicated that
       re-attempt in an equivalent PLMN is allowed;

   -   the UE is registered to a new PLMN which was not in the list of equivalent PLMNs at the time when the PDN
       CONNECTIVITY REJECT message was received;

   -   the PDN type which is used to access to the APN is changed;

   -   the UE is switched off; or

   -   the USIM is removed.

For the ESM cause values #50 "PDN type IPv4 only allowed", #51 "PDN type IPv6 only allowed", #57 "PDN type
IPv4v6 only allowed" and #58 "PDN type non IP only allowed", the UE shall ignore the value of the RATC bit in the
Re-attempt indicator IE provided by the network, if any.

Furthermore as an implementation option, for the SM cause values #50 "PDN type IPv4 only allowed", #51 "PDN type
IPv6 only allowed", #57 "PDN type IPv4v6 only allowed" and #58 "PDN type non IP only allowed", if the network
does not include a Re-attempt indicator IE the UE may decide not to automatically send another PDN
CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message for the same APN that was sent by the UE using the same PDN type, if the UE
is registered to a new PLMN which is in the list of equivalent PLMNs.

   NOTE 4: Request to send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message with a specific PDN type has to
           come from upper layers.

If the ESM cause value is #65 "maximum number of EPS bearers reached", the UE shall determine the PLMN's
maximum number of EPS bearer contexts in S1 mode (see subclause 6.5.0) as the number of active EPS bearer contexts
it has. The UE shall ignore the Back-off timer value IE and Re-attempt indicator IE provided by the network, if any.

   NOTE 5: In some situations, when attempting to establish multiple EPS bearer contexts, the number of active EPS
           bearer contexts that the UE has when ESM cause #65 is received is not equal to the maximum number of
           EPS bearer contexts reached in the network.

   NOTE 6: When the network supports emergency bearer services, it is not expected that ESM cause #65 is returned
           by the network when the UE requests a PDN connection for emergency bearer services.

The PLMN's maximum number of EPS bearer contexts in S1 mode applies to the PLMN in which the ESM cause #65
"maximum number of EPS bearers reached" is received. When the UE is switched off, when the USIM is removed, or
when there is a change in the value indicated by the network in the 15 bearers bit of the EPS network feature support IE,
the UE shall clear all previous determinations representing PLMNs maximum number of EPS bearer contexts in S1
mode. Upon successful registration with a new PLMN, the UE may clear previous determinations representing any

If the ESM cause value is #66 "requested APN not supported in current RAT and PLMN combination", the UE shall
take different actions depending on the Back-off timer value IE and the Re-attempt indicator IE optionally included:

   1) If the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message was sent standalone, the Back-off timer value IE is not
      included, and either the Re-attempt indicator IE is not included or the Re-attempt indicator IE is included
      indicating that re-attempt in an equivalent PLMN is allowed, the UE shall not initiate an attach procedure or send
      another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message for the same APN in the current PLMN in S1 mode until
      the UE is switched off or the USIM is removed;

   2) if the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message was sent standalone, the Back-off timer value IE is not
      included, and the Re-attempt indicator IE is included and indicates that re-attempt in an equivalent PLMN is not
      allowed, the UE shall not initiate an attach procedure or send a PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message for
      the same APN in any PLMN in the list of equivalent PLMNs in S1 mode until the UE is switched off or the
      USIM is removed;

   3) if the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message was sent standalone and the Back-off timer value IE is
      included, the UE shall take different actions depending on the timer value received in the Back-off timer value
      IE (if the UE is a UE configured to use AC11 – 15 in selected PLMN, exceptions are specified in
      subclause 6.3.6):

       i) if the timer value indicates neither zero nor deactivated, the UE shall start the back-off timer with the value
          provided in the Back-off timer value IE for the PLMN and APN combination and shall not send another PDN
          CONNECTIVITY REQUEST for the same APN in the current PLMN in S1 mode until the back-off timer
          expires, the UE is switched off or the USIM is removed;

       ii) if the timer value indicates that this timer is deactivated, the UE shall not send another PDN
           CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message for the same APN in the current PLMN in S1 mode until the UE is
           switched off or the USIM is removed; and

       iii) if the timer value indicates that this timer is zero, the UE may send a PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST
            message for the same APN in the current PLMN; and

   4) if the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message was sent together with an ATTACH REQUEST, the UE shall
      take different actions depending on the integrity protection of the ATTACH REJECT message (if the UE is a UE
      configured to use AC11 – 15 in selected PLMN, exceptions are specified in subclause 6.3.6):

       i) if the ATTACH REJECT message is not integrity protected, regardless whether the Back-off timer IE is
          included, the UE shall start the back-off timer with a random value from a default range specified in
          table 11.2.3(see 3GPP TS 24.008 [13]), and shall not initiate a new attach procedure or send another PDN
          CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message in the current PLMN in S1 mode with the same APN that was sent
          by the UE, until the back-off timer expires, the UE is switched off or the USIM is removed; and

       ii) if the ATTACH REJECT message is integrity protected, the UE shall proceed as follows:

          a) if the Back-off timer value IE is included and the timer value indicates neither zero nor deactivated, the
             UE shall start the back-off timer with the value provided in the Back-off timer value IE for the PDN
             connectivity procedure and PLMN and APN combination and shall not initiate a new attach procedure or
             send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message in the current PLMN in S1 mode with the
             same APN that was sent by the UE, until the back-off timer expires, the UE is switched off or the USIM
             is removed;

          b) if the Back-off timer value IE is included and the timer value indicates that this timer is deactivated, the
             UE shall not initiate a new attach procedure or send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message
             in the current PLMN in S1 mode with the same APN that was sent by the UE, until the UE is switched off
             or the USIM is removed;

          c) if the Back-off timer value IE is included and the timer value indicates that this timer is zero, the UE shall
             proceed as specified in subclause 5.5.1.2.6 item d;

          d) if the Back-off timer value IE is not included, and either the Re-attempt indicator IE is not included or the
             Re-attempt indicator IE is included indicating that re-attempt in an equivalent PLMN is allowed, the UE
             shall not initiate a new attach procedure or send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message for
             the same APN in the current PLMN in S1 mode until the UE is switched off or the USIM is removed; and

          e) if the Back-off timer value IE is not included, and the Re-attempt indicator IE is included and indicates
             that re-attempt in an equivalent PLMN is not allowed, the UE shall not initiate a new attach procedure or
             send a PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message for the same APN in any PLMN in the list of
             equivalent PLMNs in S1 mode until the UE is switched off or the USIM is removed.

   NOTE 7: Receiving ESM cause value #66 during an attach procedure without APN is not expected and the UE
           behaviour is implementation specific.

If the network includes the Re-attempt indicator IE indicating that re-attempt in an equivalent PLMN is not allowed,
then

   -   for cases 3.i, 4.i and 4.ii.a the UE shall additionally start a back-off timer with the value provided in the Back-off
       timer value IE for the PDN connectivity procedure for each combination of a PLMN from the equivalent PLMN
       list and the APN; and

   -   for cases 3.ii and 4.ii.b the UE shall deactivate the respective back-off timers for the PDN connectivity procedure
       for each combination of a PLMN from the equivalent PLMN list and the APN.

For the ESM cause value #66 "requested APN not supported in current RAT and PLMN combination" the UE shall
ignore the value of the RATC bit in the Re-attempt indicator IE provided by the network, if any.

As an implementation option, for cases 1, 3.i, 3.ii, 4.iv, 4.v.a and 4.v.b, if the Re-attempt indicator IE is not included,
the UE may decide not to automatically send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message for the same APN in
a PLMN which is in the list of equivalent PLMNs.

If the ESM cause value is #54 "PDN connection does not exist", the UE shall ignore the Back-off timer value IE and
Re-attempt indicator IE provided by the network, if any, and take different actions as follows:

   -   if the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message was sent standalone, the UE shall set the request type to
       "initial request" in the subsequent PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message to establish a PDN connectivity
       to the same APN;

   -   if the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message was sent together with an ATTACH REQUEST message, the
       UE shall set the request type to "initial request" in the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message which is
       included in the subsequent ATTACH REQUEST message to establish a PDN connectivity to the same APN.

   NOTE 8: User interaction is necessary in some cases when the UE cannot re-activate the EPS bearer context(s)
           automatically.

6.5.1.4A          Handling the maximum number of active EPS bearer contexts
If the maximum number of active EPS bearer contexts is reached at the UE (see subclause 6.5.0) and the upper layers of
the UE request connectivity to a PDN the UE shall not send a PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message unless an
active EPS bearer is deactivated. If the UE needs to de-activate an active EPS bearer context, choosing which EPS
bearer context to de-activate is implementation specific, however the UE shall not deactivate an EPS bearer context for
emergency.

   NOTE:      Subclause 6.5.1.6 specifies that a PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message with the same
              combination of APN and PDN type as an already existing, non-emergency PDN connection can be
              acceptable, in some cases. In these cases the UE does not need to de-activate an active EPS bearer context
              if the maximum number of active EPS bearer contexts is reached at the UE.

If the UE needs to de-activate an EPS bearer context in order to request an emergency EPS bearer context, it shall either
de-activate an EPS bearer context locally or via explicit signalling. If the UE performs local de-activation, the UE shall
perform tracking area updating procedure to indicate EPS bearer context status to the network.

6.5.1.4B          Void

6.5.1.5           Abnormal cases in the UE
The following abnormal cases can be identified:

   a) T3482 expired




                                                           ETSI
3GPP TS 24.301 version 15.8.0 Release 15                  271                        ETSI TS 124 301 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


      On the first expiry of the timer T3482:

      -   if the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message was sent with request type set to "emergency" or
          "handover of emergency bearer services" in a stand-alone PDN connectivity procedure, then the UE shall:

          a) inform the upper layers of the failure to establish the emergency bearer; or

   NOTE:     This can result in the upper layers requesting establishment of a CS emergency call (if not already
             attempted in the CS domain), or other implementation specific mechanisms, e.g. procedures specified in
             3GPP TS 24.229 [13D] can result in the emergency call being attempted to another IP-CAN.

          b) detach locally, if not detached already, attempt EPS attach for emergency bearer services.

      -   otherwise, the UE shall resend the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST and shall reset and restart timer
          T3482. This retransmission is repeated four times, i.e. on the fifth expiry of timer T3482, the UE shall abort
          the procedure, release the PTI allocated for this invocation and enter the state PROCEDURE
          TRANSACTION INACTIVE.

   b) T3447 is running

      The UE shall not send a PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message when the UE is in EMM-CONNECTED
      mode after the UE attached without PDN connection, unless:

      -   establishment of a PDN connection for emergency bearer services is requested;

      -   the UE is a UE configured to use AC11 – 15 in the selected PLMN; or

      -   a network initiated signalling message has been received.

      The PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message can be sent, if still necessary, when timer T3447 expires.

6.5.1.6          Abnormal cases on the network side
The following abnormal cases can be identified:

   a) UE initiated PDN connectivity request for an already existing PDN connection:

      If the network receives a PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message with the same combination of APN and
      PDN type as an already existing PDN connection,

          If the information elements in the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message do not differ from the ones
          received within the previous PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message, and the MME has not received
          the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT ACCEPT message from UE, the network shall
          resend the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message and continue the
          previous procedure.

          If one or more information elements in the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message differ from the ones
          received within the previous PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message, and multiple PDN connections for
          a given APN are not allowed, the network may deactivate the existing EPS bearer contexts for the PDN
          connection locally without notification to the UE and proceed with the requested PDN connectivity
          procedure or may reject this PDN connectivity procedure including the ESM cause #55 "multiple PDN
          connections for a given APN not allowed", in the PDN CONNECTIVITY REJECT message.

      If the network receives a PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message with request type "emergency" and the
      MME has not received the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT ACCEPT message from UE for
      the previous PDN connectivity request for emergency bearer services, the network shall resend the ACTIVATE
      DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message and continue the previous procedure. If there is
      already a PDN connection for emergency bearer services existing, the MME shall reject the request with ESM
      cause #55 "multiple PDN connections for a given APN not allowed" or deactivate the existing EPS bearer
      contexts for the PDN connection locally without notification to the UE and proceed with the requested PDN
      connectivity procedure.

   b) UE initiated PDN connectivity request with request type "handover" for a PDN connection that does not exist:




                                                          ETSI
3GPP TS 24.301 version 15.8.0 Release 15                  272                       ETSI TS 124 301 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


       If the network receives a PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message for either a default APN or a specific
       APN with request type set to "handover" and the MME does not have any information about that PDN
       connection, then MME shall reject the PDN connectivity request procedure including the ESM cause #54 "PDN
       connection does not exist", in the PDN CONNECTIVITY REJECT message.

   c) ESM information not received:

       If the ESM information transfer flag in the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message has been set and the
       ESM information is not received before the final expiry of timer T3489 as described in subclause 6.6.1.2.6, the
       MME shall reject the PDN connectivity request procedure including the ESM cause #53 "ESM information not
       received", in the PDN CONNECTIVITY REJECT message.

   d) Additional UE initiated PDN connectivity request received from a UE that is attached for emergency bearer
      services:

       The MME shall reject the request with ESM cause #31 "request rejected, unspecified".

   e) A PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message with request type "handover of emergency bearer services"
      received from a UE and the MME does not have any information about a P-GW currently providing emergency
      bearer services for the UE or the MME is not configured with an address of a P-GW in the MME emergency
      configuration data:

       MME shall reject the PDN connectivity request procedure including the ESM cause #54 "PDN connection does
       not exist", in the PDN CONNECTIVITY REJECT message.

6.5.1.7          Handling PDN connectivity request for UE configured for dual priority
If a PDN connection exists that was established due to a request including a low priority indicator set to "MS is
configured for NAS signalling low priority" and the upper layers of the UE request to establish a PDN connection with
the same APN and a low priority indicator set to "MS is not configured for NAS signalling low priority", when
initiating the PDN connectivity request procedure, the UE shall:

   -   send a PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message with the same combination of APN and PDN type as the
       existing PDN connection. If the UE receives a PDN CONNECTIVITY REJECT message with ESM cause #55
       "multiple PDN connections for a given APN not allowed", the upper layers are informed of this; or

   -   send a PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message with the same APN after the successful deactivation of the
       existing PDN connection.

   NOTE:      The above list of options also apply for the case when the existing PDN connection was established due
              to a request including a low priority indicator set to "MS is not configured for NAS signalling low
              priority" and the new request to establish a PDN connection with the same APN contains a low priority
              indicator set to "MS is configured for NAS signalling low priority".

As an alternative the upper layers of the UE can request to establish a PDN connection with a different APN.


6.5.2         UE requested PDN disconnect procedure

6.5.2.1          General
The purpose of the UE requested PDN disconnection procedure is for a UE to request disconnection from one PDN. If
EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is not supported by the UE or the MME, the UE can initiate this
procedure to disconnect from any PDN as long as it is connected to at least one other PDN. If EMM-REGISTERED
without PDN connection is supported by the UE and the MME, the UE can initiate this procedure to disconnect from
any PDN. With this procedure, all EPS bearer contexts established towards this PDN, including the default EPS bearer
context, are released.

The UE is allowed to initiate the PDN disconnection procedure even if the timer T3396 is running.

6.5.2.2          UE requested PDN disconnection procedure initiation
In order to request PDN disconnection from a PDN, the UE shall send a PDN DISCONNECT REQUEST message to
the MME, start the timer T3492 and enter the state PROCEDURE TRANSACTION PENDING (see example in
figure 6.5.2.2.1). The PDN DISCONNECT REQUEST message shall include the EPS bearer identity of the default
bearer associated with the PDN to disconnect from as the linked EPS bearer identity in the PDN DISCONNECT
REQUEST message.




                        Figure 6.5.2.2.1: UE requested PDN disconnection procedure


6.5.2.3          UE requested PDN disconnection procedure accepted by the network
Upon receipt of the PDN DISCONNECT REQUEST message, if it is accepted by the network, the MME shall initiate
the bearer context deactivation procedure by sending the DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST
message including the linked EPS bearer identity of the default bearer associated with the PDN to disconnect from and
the PTI. The behaviour of the MME is described in subclause 6.4.4.

Upon receipt of the DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message with a PTI which matches the
value used for the PDN DISCONNECT REQUEST message, the UE shall stop the timer T3492 and enter the state
PROCEDURE TRANSACTION INACTIVE. The behaviour of the UE is described in subclause 6.4.4. The UE should
ensure that the procedure transaction identity (PTI) assigned to this procedure is not released immediately. The way to
achieve this is implementation dependent. While the PTI value is not released, the UE regards any received
DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message with the same PTI value as a network retransmission
(see subclause 7.3.1).

On reception of DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER CONTEXT ACCEPT message from the UE, the MME releases all the
resources reserved for the PDN in the network.

6.5.2.4          UE requested PDN disconnection procedure not accepted by the network
Upon receipt of the PDN DISCONNECT REQUEST message, if it is not accepted by the network, the MME shall send
a PDN DISCONNECT REJECT message to the UE. The PDN DISCONNECT REJECT message shall contain the PTI
and an ESM cause IE that typically indicates one of the following ESM cause values:

   #35:   PTI already in use;

   #43:   invalid EPS bearer identity;

   #49:   last PDN disconnection not allowed;

   #95 – 111: protocol errors.

If EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is supported by the UE and the MME, then ESM cause #49 "last
PDN disconnection not allowed" is not applicable.

Upon receipt of the PDN DISCONNECT REJECT message, the UE shall stop the timer T3492, enter the state
PROCEDURE TRANSACTION INACTIVE and abort the PDN disconnection procedure. Additionally, in all cases
with the exception of the UE having received ESM cause #49 "last PDN disconnection not allowed" if EMM-
REGISTERED without PDN connection is not supported by the UE or the MME, the UE shall deactivate all EPS bearer
contexts for this PDN connection locally without peer-to-peer signalling between the UE and the MME. If the UE
receives ESM cause #49 "last PDN disconnection not allowed" and the UE has any other PDN connections established,
the UE may locally deactivate, without peer-to-peer signalling between the UE and the MME, all EPS bearer contexts
associated with those other PDN connections.

6.5.2.5          Abnormal cases in the UE
The following abnormal cases can be identified:

   a) Expiry of timer T3492:

       On the first expiry of the timer T3492, the UE shall resend the PDN DISCONNECT REQUEST and shall reset
       and restart timer T3492. This retransmission is repeated four times, i.e. on the fifth expiry of timer T3492, the
       UE shall abort the procedure, deactivate all EPS bearer contexts for this PDN connection locally without peer-to-
       peer signalling between the UE and the MME, release the PTI allocated for this invocation and enter the state
       PROCEDURE TRANSACTION INACTIVE. In order to synchronize EPS bearer contexts status with the MME,
       on indication of "back to E-UTRAN coverage" from the lower layers, the UE shall send a TRACKING AREA
       UPDATE REQUEST message that includes the EPS bearer context status IE to the MME.

   b) Collision of UE requested PDN disconnect procedure and dedicated EPS bearer context activation procedure:

       When the UE receives an ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message during the
       PDN disconnect procedure, and the EPS bearer to be activated belongs to the PDN connection the UE wants to
       disconnect, the UE shall ignore the ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message
       and proceed with the PDN disconnect procedure.

   c) Collision of UE requested PDN disconnect procedure and EPS bearer context modification:

       When the UE receives a MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message during the PDN disconnect
       procedure, and the EPS bearer to be modified belongs to the PDN connection the UE wants to disconnect, the
       UE shall ignore the MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message and proceed with the PDN
       disconnect procedure.

   d) Collision of UE requested PDN disconnect procedure and EPS bearer context deactivation procedure:

       When the UE receives a DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message during the PDN
       disconnect procedure, and the EPS bearer indicated in the DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER CONTEXT
       REQUEST message is a dedicated EPS bearer belonging to the PDN connection the UE wants to disconnect, the
       UE shall proceed with both procedures.

6.5.2.6          Abnormal cases on the network side
The following abnormal cases can be identified:

   a) No PDN connection with the linked EPS bearer identity activated:

       If the linked EPS bearer identity included in the PDN DISCONNECT REQUEST message does not belong to
       the default EPS bearer context of an established PDN connection, the MME shall reply with a PDN
       DISCONNECT REJECT message with ESM cause #43 "invalid EPS bearer identity".


6.5.3         UE requested bearer resource allocation procedure

6.5.3.1          General
The purpose of the UE requested bearer resource allocation procedure is for a UE to request an allocation of bearer
resources for a traffic flow aggregate. The UE requests a specific QoS demand (QCI) and optionally sends a GBR
requirement for a new traffic flow aggregate. If accepted by the network, this procedure invokes a dedicated EPS bearer

context activation procedure (see subclause 6.4.2) or an EPS bearer context modification procedure (see
subclause 6.4.3).

If there is a PDN connection for emergency bearer services established, the UE shall not request additional bearer
resources for this PDN connection.

6.5.3.2           UE requested bearer resource allocation procedure initiation
In order to request the allocation of bearer resources for one traffic flow aggregate, the UE shall send a BEARER
RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST message to the MME, start timer T3480 and enter the state PROCEDURE
TRANSACTION PENDING (see example in figure 6.5.3.2.1).

The UE shall include the EPS bearer identity of the default EPS bearer associated with the requested bearer resource in
the Linked EPS bearer identity IE. The UE shall set the TFT operation code in the Traffic flow aggregate IE to "Create
new TFT". The packet filters in the Traffic flow aggregate IE shall include at least one packet filter applicable for the
uplink direction. In the Required traffic flow QoS IE, the UE shall indicate a QCI and, if the UE also includes a GBR,
the additional GBR required for the traffic flow aggregate.

For the NBIFOM procedures as defined in 3GPP TS 24.161 [36], the UE may send a BEARER RESOURCE
ALLOCATION REQUEST message to the MME. If the traffic flow aggregate IE is not needed in those procedures, the
UE shall set:

   -   the length indicator of the Traffic flow aggregate IE to the value 1;

   -   the TFT operation code to "000";

   -   the E bit to zero; and

   -   the number of packet filters to zero;

and in the Required traffic flow QoS IE:

   -   the length indicator to the value 1; and

   -   the QCI to zero.

6.5.3.3           UE requested bearer resource allocation procedure accepted by the network
Upon receipt of the BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST message, the MME checks whether the
resources requested by the UE can be established by verifying the EPS bearer identity given in the Linked EPS bearer
identity IE to be any of the active default EPS bearer context(s).

If the bearer resource allocation requested is accepted by the network, the MME shall initiate either a dedicated EPS
bearer context activation procedure or an EPS bearer context modification procedure. Upon receipt of an ACTIVATE
DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST or MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message
with a PTI which matches the value used for the BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST message, the UE
shall stop timer T3480 and enter the state PROCEDURE TRANSACTION INACTIVE. The UE should ensure that the
procedure transaction identity (PTI) assigned to this procedure is not released immediately. The way to achieve this is
implementation dependent. While the PTI value is not released, the UE regards any received ACTIVATE
DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST or MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message
with the same PTI value as a network retransmission (see subclause 7.3.1).

If the ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message is received, the UE shall verify that
the EPS bearer identity given in the EPS bearer identity IE is not already used by any EPS bearer context. The UE shall
then proceed as described in subclause 6.4.2.3 or subclause 6.4.2.4.

If the MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message is received, the UE verifies that the EPS bearer identity
given in the EPS bearer identity IE is any of the active EPS bearer contexts. The UE shall then proceed as described in
subclause 6.4.3.3 or subclause 6.4.3.4.

                 network

6.5.3.4.1            General
If the bearer resource allocation requested cannot be accepted by the network, the MME shall send a BEARER
RESOURCE ALLOCATION REJECT message to the UE. The message shall contain the PTI and an ESM cause value
indicating the reason for rejecting the UE requested bearer resource allocation.

The ESM cause value typically indicates one of the following:

   #26:   insufficient resources;

   #30:   request rejected by Serving GW or PDN GW;

   #31:   request rejected, unspecified;

   #32:   service option not supported;

   #33:   requested service option not subscribed;

   #34:   service option temporarily out of order;

   #35:   PTI already in use;

   #37:   EPS QoS not accepted;

   #41:   semantic error in the TFT operation;

   #42:   syntactical error in the TFT operation;

   #43:   invalid EPS bearer identity;

   #44:   semantic error(s) in packet filter(s);

   #45:   syntactical error(s) in packet filter(s);

   #56:   collision with network initiated request;

   #59:   unsupported QCI value;

   #60:   bearer handling not supported;

   #65:   maximum number of EPS bearers reached; or

   #95 – 111:    protocol errors.

If the bearer resource allocation requested is for an established LIPA PDN connection or SIPTO at the local network
PDN connection, then the network shall reply with a BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REJECT message with
ESM cause #60 "bearer handling not supported".

If the requested new TFT is not available, then the BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REJECT message shall be
sent.

The TFT in the request message is checked by the network for different types of TFT IE errors as follows:

   a) Semantic errors in TFT operations:

      1) When the TFT operation is an operation other than "Create a new TFT".

       The network shall reject the allocation request with ESM cause #41 "semantic error in the TFT operation".

   b) Syntactical errors in TFT operations:

      1) When the TFT operation = "Create a new TFT" and the packet filter list in the TFT IE is empty.

      2) When there are other types of syntactical errors in the coding of the TFT IE, such as a mismatch between the
         number of packet filters subfield, and the number of packet filters in the packet filter list.

       The network shall reject the allocation request with ESM cause #42 "syntactical error in the TFT operation".

   c) Semantic errors in packet filters:

       When a packet filter consists of conflicting packet filter components which would render the packet filter
       ineffective, i.e. no IP packet will ever fit this packet filter. How the network determines a semantic error in a
       packet filter is outside the scope of the present document.

       The network shall reject the allocation request with ESM cause #44 "semantic errors in packet filter(s)".

   d) Syntactical errors in packet filters:

      1) When the TFT operation = "Create a new TFT" and two or more packet filters among all TFTs associated
         with the PDN connection would have identical packet filter precedence values.

      2) When there are other types of syntactical errors in the coding of packet filters, such as the use of a reserved
         value for a packet filter component identifier.

       In case 1, if the old packet filters do not belong to the default EPS bearer context, the network shall not diagnose
       an error, shall further process the new request and, if it was processed successfully, shall delete the old packet
       filters which have identical filter precedence values. Furthermore, the network shall perform an EPS bearer
       context deactivation request procedure to deactivate the dedicated EPS bearer context(s) for which it has deleted
       the packet filters.

       In case 1, if one or more old packet filters belong to the default EPS bearer context, the network shall release the
       relevant PDN connection using the EPS bearer context deactivation procedure.If it is the last remaining PDN
       connection and EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is not supported by the UE or the MME, the
       network shall detach the UE using detach type "re-attach required".

       Otherwise the network shall reject the allocation request with ESM cause #45 "syntactical errors in packet
       filter(s)".

The network may include a Back-off timer value IE in the BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REJECT message.

If the Back-off timer value IE is included and the ESM cause value is different from #26 "insufficient resources" and
#65 "maximum number of EPS bearers reached", the network may include the Re-attempt indicator IE to indicate
whether the UE is allowed to attempt a secondary PDP context activation procedure in the PLMN for the same APN in
A/Gb or Iu mode, and whether another attempt in A/Gb and Iu mode or in S1 mode is allowed in an equivalent PLMN.

Upon receipt of a BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REJECT message, the UE shall stop the timer T3480, release
the traffic flow aggregate description associated to the PTI value, and enter the state PROCEDURE TRANSACTION
INACTIVE.

6.5.3.4.2            Handling of network rejection due to ESM cause #26
If the ESM cause value is #26 "insufficient resources" and the Back-off timer value IE is included, the UE shall ignore
the Re-attempt indicator IE provided by the network, if any, and take different actions depending on the timer value
received for timer T3396 in the Back-off timer value IE (if the UE is configured for dual priority, exceptions are
specified in subclause 6.5.5; if the UE is a UE configured to use AC11 – 15 in selected PLMN, exceptions are specified
in subclause 6.3.5):

   i) if the timer value indicates neither zero nor deactivated, the UE shall stop timer T3396 associated with the
      corresponding APN, if it is running. The UE shall then start T3396 with the value provided in the Back-off timer
      value IE and not send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST, BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION
      REQUEST with exception of those identified in subclause 6.5.4.1, or BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION
      REQUEST message for the same APN until timer T3396 expires or timer T3396 is stopped. If the UE did not
      provide an APN for the establishment of the PDN connection and the request type was different from
      "emergency" and from "handover of emergency bearer services", the UE shall stop the timer T3396 associated
      with no APN if it is running. The UE shall start timer T3396 with the received value and not send another PDN
      CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message without an APN and with request type different from "emergency" and
      from "handover of emergency bearer services", or another BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST
      with exception of those identified in subclause 6.5.4.1, or BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST
      message for a non-emergency PDN connection established without an APN provided by the UE, until timer
      T3396 expires or timer T3396 is stopped. The UE shall not stop timer T3396 upon a PLMN change or inter-
      system change;

   ii) if the timer value indicates that this timer is deactivated, the UE shall not send another PDN CONNECTIVITY
       REQUEST, BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST with exception of those identified in
       subclause 6.5.4.1, or BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST message for the same APN until the
       UE is switched off or the USIM is removed or the UE receives an ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER
       CONTEXT REQUEST, ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST or MODIFY EPS
       BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message for the same APN from the network or a DEACTIVATE EPS
       BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message including ESM cause #39 "reactivation requested" for a default EPS
       bearer context for the same APN from the network. If the UE did not provide an APN for the establishment of
       the PDN connection and the request type was different from "emergency" and from "handover of emergency
       bearer services", the UE shall not send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message without an APN
       and with request type different from "emergency" and from "handover of emergency bearer services", or another
       BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST with exception of those identified in subclause 6.5.4.1, or
       BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST message for a non-emergency PDN connection established
       without APN provided by the UE, until the UE is switched off or the USIM is removed, or the UE receives an
       ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST, ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER
       CONTEXT REQUEST or MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message for a non-emergency PDN
       connection established without an APN provided by the UE, or a DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER CONTEXT
       REQUEST message including ESM cause #39 "reactivation requested" for a default EPS bearer context of a
       non-emergency PDN connection established without an APN provided by the UE. The timer T3396 remains
       deactivated upon a PLMN change or inter-system change; or

   iii) if the timer value indicates zero, the UE:

       -   shall stop timer T3396 associated with the corresponding APN, if running, and may send another PDN
           CONNECTIVITY REQUEST, BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST or BEARER
           RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST message for the same APN; and

       -   if the UE did not provide an APN for the establishment of the PDN connection and the request type was
           different from "emergency" and from "handover of emergency bearer services", the UE shall stop timer
           T3396 associated with no APN, if running, and may send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST
           message without an APN, or another BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST or BEARER
           RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST message for a non-emergency PDN connection established without
           an APN provided by the UE.

If the Back-off timer value IE is not included, the UE may send a PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST, BEARER
RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST or BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST messages for the
same APN.

The further actions to be performed by the UE are implementation dependent as part of upper layers responsibility.

If the timer T3396 is running when the UE enters state EMM-DEREGISTERED, the UE remains switched on, and the
USIM in the UE remains the same, then timer T3396 is kept running until it expires or it is stopped.

If the UE is switched off when the timer T3396 is running, and if the USIM in the UE remains the same when the UE is
switched on, the UE behaves as follows:

   -   let t1 be the time remaining for T3396 timeout at switch off and let t be the time elapsed between switch off and
       switch on. If t1 is greater than t, then the timer shall be restarted with the value t1 – t. If t1 is equal to or less than
       t, then the timer need not be restarted. If the UE is not capable of determining t, then the UE shall restart the
       timer with the value t1;

   -   if prior to switch off, timer T3396 was running for a specific APN, because a PDN CONNECTIVITY
       REQUEST, BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST or BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION
       REQUEST message containing the low priority indicator set to "MS is configured for NAS signalling low
       priority" was rejected with a timer value for timer T3396, and if timer T3396 is restarted at switch on, then the
       UE configured for dual priority shall handle session management requests as indicated in subclause 6.5.5; and

   -   if prior to switch off timer T3396 was running because a PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST without APN sent
       together with an ATTACH REQUEST message containing the low priority indicator set to "MS is configured for
       NAS signalling low priority" was rejected with a timer value for timer T3396, and if timer T3396 is restarted at
       switch on, then the UE configured for dual priority shall handle session management requests as indicated in
       subclause 6.5.5.

6.5.3.4.3             Handling of network rejection due to ESM cause other than ESM cause #26
If the ESM cause value is different from #26 "insufficient resources" and #65 "maximum number of EPS bearers
reached", and the Back-off timer value IE is included, the UE shall behave as follows depending on the timer value
received in the Back-off timer value IE (if the UE is a UE configured to use AC11 – 15 in selected PLMN, exceptions
are specified in subclause 6.3.6):

   -   if the timer value indicates neither zero nor deactivated, the UE shall start the back-off timer with the value
       provided in the Back-off timer value IE for the bearer resource allocation procedure and PLMN and APN
       combination and not send another BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST message in the PLMN for
       the same APN until the back-off timer expires, the UE is switched off or the USIM is removed;

   -   if the timer value indicates that this timer is deactivated, the UE shall not send another BEARER RESOURCE
       ALLOCATION REQUEST message in the PLMN for the same APN until the UE is switched off or the USIM is
       removed; and

   -   if the timer value indicates zero, the UE may send another BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST
       message in the PLMN for the same APN.

If the Back-off timer value IE is not included, then the UE shall ignore the Re-attempt Indicator IE provided by the
network, if any.

   1) Additionally, if the ESM cause value is #32 "service option not supported", or #33 "requested service option not
      subscribed", the UE shall proceed as follows:

       -   if the UE is registered in the HPLMN or in a PLMN that is within the EHPLMN list, the UE shall behave as
           described above in the present subclause, using the configured SM_RetryWaitTime value as specified in
           3GPP TS 24.368 [15A] or in USIM file NASCONFIG as specified in 3GPP TS 31.102 [17], if available, as
           back-off timer value; and

       -   otherwise, if the UE is not registered in its HPLMN or a PLMN that is within the EHPLMN list or the
           SM_RetryWaitTime value is not configured, the UE shall behave as described above in the present
           subclause, using the default value of 12 minutes for the back-off timer.

   2) For ESM cause values different from #32 "service option not supported", or #33 "requested service option not
      subscribed", the UE behaviour regarding the start of a back-off timer is unspecified.

The UE shall not stop any back-off timer upon a PLMN change or inter-system change. If the network indicates that a
back-off timer for the bearer resource allocation procedure and PLMN and APN combination is deactivated, then it
remains deactivated upon a PLMN change or inter-system change.

   NOTE 1: This means the back-off timer can still be running or be deactivated for the given ESM procedure and
           PLMN and APN combination when the UE returns to the PLMN or when it performs inter-system change
           back from A/Gb or Iu mode to S1 mode. Thus the UE can still be prevented from sending another
           BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST message in the PLMN for the same APN.

If the back-off timer is started upon receipt of BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REJECT (i.e. the timer value
was provided by the network, a configured value is available or the default value is used as explained above) or the
back-off timer is deactivated, the UE behaves as follows:

   1) after a PLMN change the UE may send a BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST message for the
      same APN in the new PLMN, if the back-off timer is not running and is not deactivated for the bearer resource
      allocation procedure and the combination of new PLMN and APN;

       Furthermore as an implementation option, for the ESM cause values #32 "service option not supported" or #33
       "requested service option not subscribed", if the network does not include a Re-attempt indicator IE, the UE may
       decide not to automatically send another BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST message for the
       same APN that was sent by the UE, if the UE is registered to a new PLMN which is in the list of equivalent
       PLMNs.

   2) if the network does not include the Re-attempt indicator IE to indicate whether re-attempt in A/Gb or Iu mode is
      allowed, or the UE ignores the Re-attempt indicator IE, e.g. because the Back-off timer value IE is not included,
      then:

       -   if the UE is registered in its HPLMN or in a PLMN that is within the EHPLMN list, the UE shall apply the
           configured SM_RetryAtRATChange value as specified in 3GPP TS 24.368 [15A] or in USIM file
           NASCONFIG as specified in 3GPP TS 31.102 [17], if available, to determine whether the UE may attempt a
           secondary PDP context activation procedure for the same PLMN and APN combination in A/Gb or Iu mode;
           and

       -   if the UE is not registered in its HPLMN or in a PLMN that is within the EHPLMN list, or if the NAS
           configuration MO as specified in 3GPP TS 24.368 [15A] is not available and the value for inter-system
           change is not configured in the USIM file NASCONFIG, then the UE behaviour regarding a secondary PDP
           context activation procedure for the same PLMN and APN combination in A/Gb or Iu mode is unspecified;
           and

   3) if the network includes the Re-attempt indicator IE indicating that re-attempt in an equivalent PLMN is not
      allowed, then depending on the timer value received in the Back-off timer value IE, for each combination of a
      PLMN from the equivalent PLMN list and the APN the UE shall start a back-off timer for the bearer resource
      allocation procedure with the value provided by the network, or deactivate the respective back-off timer as
      follows:

       -   If the Re-attempt indicator IE additionally indicates that re-attempt in A/Gb or Iu mode is allowed, the UE
           shall start or deactivate the back-off timer for S1 mode only; and

       -   otherwise the UE shall start or deactivate the back-off timer for A/Gb, Iu, and S1 mode.

If the back-off timer for a PLMN and APN combination was started or deactivated in A/Gb or Iu mode upon receipt of
an ACTIVATE SECONDARY PDP CONTEXT REJECT message (see 3GPP TS 24.008 [13]) and the network
indicated that re-attempt in S1 mode is allowed, then this back-off timer does not prevent the UE from sending a
BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST message in this PLMN for the same APN after inter-system change
to S1 mode. If the network indicated that re-attempt in S1 mode is not allowed, the UE shall not send any BEARER
RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST message in this PLMN for the same APN after inter-system change to S1
mode until the timer expires, the UE is switched off or the USIM is removed.

   NOTE 2: The back-off timer is used to describe a logical model of the required UE behaviour. This model does not
           imply any specific implementation, e.g. as a timer or timestamp.

   NOTE 3: Reference to back-off timer in this section can either refer to use of timer T3396 or to use of a different
           packet system specific timer within the UE. Whether the UE uses T3396 as a back-off timer or it uses
           different packet system specific timers as back-off timers is left up to UE implementation. This back-off
           timer is stopped when the UE is switched off or the USIM is removed.

If the ESM cause value is #65 "maximum number of EPS bearers reached", the UE shall determine the PLMN's
maximum number of EPS bearer contexts in S1 mode (see subclause 6.5.0) as the number of active EPS bearer contexts
it has. The UE shall ignore the Back-off timer value IE and Re-attempt indicator IE provided by the network, if any.

   NOTE 5: In some situations, when attempting to establish multiple EPS bearer contexts, the number of active EPS
           bearer contexts in the UE when cause #65 is received is not equal to the maximum number of EPS bearer
           contexts reached in the network.

The PLMN's maximum number of EPS bearer contexts in S1 mode applies to the PLMN in which the ESM cause #65
"maximum number of EPS bearers reached" is received. When the UE is switched off or when the USIM is removed,
the UE shall clear all previous determinations representing any PLMN's maximum number of EPS bearer contexts in S1
mode. Upon successful registration with a new PLMN, the UE may clear previous determinations representing any
PLMN's maximum number of EPS bearer contexts in S1 mode.

The further actions to be performed by the UE are implementation dependent as part of upper layers responsibility.

6.5.3.4A          Handling the maximum number of active EPS bearer contexts
If the UE requests allocation of additional bearer resources, and the network has reached its maximum number of active
EPS bearer contexts, then the network can:

   -   reject the request if the network decides that it is necessary to allocate a dedicated EPS bearer context; or

   -   accept the request by sending a MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message.

   NOTE:      An example of where the network will reject the request for allocation of additional bearer resources is
              when the request includes a GBR requirement while all existing bearers are non-GBR bearers, and the
              maximum number of active EPS bearer contexts has been reached at the network.

If the maximum number of active EPS bearer contexts is reached at the UE (see subclause 6.5.0) and the UE de-
activates an active EPS bearer context prior to sending the request for additional bearer resources, then choosing which
EPS bearer context to de-activate is a implementation specific, however the UE shall not deactivate a default EPS
bearer context for emergency.

6.5.3.5           Abnormal cases in the UE
The following abnormal cases can be identified:

   a) Expiry of timer T3480:

       On the first expiry of the timer T3480, the UE shall resend the BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION
       REQUEST and shall reset and restart timer T3480. This retransmission is repeated four times, i.e. on the fifth
       expiry of timer T3480, the UE shall abort the procedure, release the PTI allocated for this activation and enter
       the state PROCEDURE TRANSACTION INACTIVE.

   b) Unknown EPS bearer context

       Upon receipt of the BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REJECT message including ESM cause #43
       "invalid EPS bearer identity", the UE shall deactivate the existing default EPS bearer context locally without
       peer-to-peer signalling between the UE and the MME.

   c) Collision of a UE requested bearer resource allocation procedure and an EPS bearer context deactivation
      procedure.

       When the UE receives a DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message for the default EPS
       bearer context related to the UE requested bearer resource allocation procedure, the UE shall abort the UE
       requested bearer resource allocation procedure and proceed with the EPS bearer context deactivation procedure.

6.5.3.6           Abnormal cases on the network side
The following abnormal case can be identified:

   a) No PDN connection with the linked EPS bearer identity activated:

       If the linked EPS bearer identity included in the BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST message
       does not belong to the default EPS bearer context of an established PDN connection, the MME shall reply with a
       BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REJECT message with ESM cause #43 "invalid EPS bearer identity".

   b) BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST message received for a PDN connection established for
      emergency bearer services:

       The MME shall reply with a BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REJECT message with ESM cause #31
       "request rejected, unspecified".


6.5.4         UE requested bearer resource modification procedure

6.5.4.1           General
The purpose of the UE requested bearer resource modification procedure is for a UE to request a modification, or
release of bearer resources for a traffic flow aggregate, or modification of a traffic flow aggregate by replacing packet
filters or adding packet filters, or re-negotiate header compression configuration associated to an EPS bearer context, or
to indicate a change of 3GPP PS data off UE status for a PDN connection. When requesting a modification of bearer
resources for a traffic flow aggregate or a modification of a traffic flow aggregate, the UE can modify the existing GBR.
If accepted by the network, this procedure invokes a dedicated EPS bearer context activation procedure (see
subclause 6.4.2), an EPS bearer context modification procedure (see subclause 6.4.3), or an EPS bearer context
deactivation procedure (see subclause 6.4.4).

If there is a PDN connection for emergency bearer services established, the UE shall not request a modification of
bearer resources for this PDN connection.

When the UE requested bearer resource modification procedure is used to indicate a change of 3GPP PS data off UE
status for a PDN connection (see subclause 6.3.10), the UE shall initiate the UE requested bearer resource modification
procedure even if the timer T3396 or the back-off timer is running or is deactivated.

6.5.4.2           UE requested bearer resource modification procedure initiation
In order to request the modification of bearer resources for one traffic flow aggregate, the UE shall send a BEARER
RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST message to the MME, start timer T3481 and enter the state PROCEDURE
TRANSACTION PENDING (see example in figure 6.5.4.2.1).

The UE shall include the EPS bearer identity of the EPS bearer associated with the traffic flow aggregate in the EPS
bearer identity for packet filter IE.

To request a change of the GBR without changing the packet filter(s), the UE shall set the TFT operation code in the
Traffic flow aggregate IE to "no TFT operation" and include the packet filter identifier(s) to which the change of the
GBR applies in the Packet filter identifier parameter in the parameters list. The UE shall indicate the new GBR
requested for the EPS bearer context in the Required traffic flow QoS IE.

To request a modification of a traffic flow aggregate, the UE shall set the TFT operation code in the Traffic flow
aggregate IE to "Replace packet filters in existing TFT" or "Add packet filters to existing TFT". If the TFT operation
code is set to "Add packet filters to existing TFT", the UE shall include in the parameter list one existing packet filter
identifier to which the newly added packet filter(s) is linked. If the EPS bearer is a GBR bearer and the UE also wishes
to request a change of GBR, the UE shall indicate the new GBR requested for the EPS bearer context in the Required
traffic flow QoS IE.

To request a release of bearer resources, the UE shall set the TFT operation code in the Traffic flow aggregate IE to
"Delete packet filters from existing TFT". If the EPS bearer is a GBR bearer and the UE does not request the release of
all bearer resources, the UE shall indicate the new GBR requested for the EPS bearer context in the Required traffic
flow QoS IE.

To request re-negotiation of header compression configuration associated to an EPS bearer context, the UE shall include
the Header compression configuration IE in the BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST message if the
network indicated "Control plane CIoT EPS optimization supported" and "Header compression for control plane CIoT
EPS optimization supported" in the EPS network feature support IE.

To indicate a change of 3GPP PS data off UE status associated to a PDN connection, the UE shall include the protocol
configuration options IE in the BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST message and set the 3GPP PS

data off UE status only if the network included the 3GPP PS data off support indication in the protocol configuration
options IE in the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message when the PDN connection
was established. The UE behaves as described in subclause 6.3.10.

If the UE requests the modification of a traffic flow aggregate, which is assigned to a dedicated EPS bearer context, it
shall ensure that at least one packet filter applicable for the uplink direction remains among the packet filters created on
request from the UE in that TFT, or no own packet filters.

   NOTE:      If the UE requests the release of all bearer resources of a GBR bearer and includes a Required traffic flow
              QoS IE in the BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST message, the network ignores the
              Required traffic flow QoS IE.

If the UE includes the Required traffic flow QoS IE, the UE shall set the QCI to the current QCI value of the EPS bearer
context.

If the UE requests the release of bearer resources, the ESM cause value typically indicates one of the following:

   #36:    regular deactivation.

For the NBIFOM procedures as defined in 3GPP TS 24.161 [36], the UE may send a BEARER RESOURCE
MODIFICATION REQUEST message to the MME.

It is possible that the traffic flow aggregate IE is not needed in the following procedures:

   -   re-negotiation of header compression configuration associated to an EPS bearer context;

   -   indicating a change of 3GPP PS data off UE status associated to a PDN connection; or

   -   NBIFOM procedures.

If the traffic flow aggregate IE is not needed, the UE shall set:

   -   the length indicator of the Traffic flow aggregate IE to the value 1;

   -   the TFT operation code to "000";

   -   the E bit to zero; and

   -   the number of packet filters to zero.

6.5.4.3           UE requested bearer resource modification procedure accepted by the
                  network
Upon receipt of the BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST message, the MME checks whether the
resources requested by the UE can be established, modified or released by verifying the EPS bearer identity given in the
EPS bearer identity for packet filter IE.

If the bearer resource modification requested is accepted by the network, the MME shall initiate either a dedicated EPS
bearer context activation procedure, an EPS bearer context modification procedure or an EPS bearer context
deactivation procedure.

If the request to re-negotiate header compression configuration associated to an EPS bearer context is accepted by the
network, the MME shall initiate an EPS bearer context modification procedure.

If the bearer resource modification requests a release of bearer resources that results in the TFT of the EPS bearer
context containing only packet filters applicable to the uplink direction, the network may initiate the EPS bearer context
deactivation procedure.

Upon receipt of an ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST, MODIFY EPS BEARER
CONTEXT REQUEST or DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message with a PTI which matches
the value used for the BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST message, the UE shall stop timer T3481
and enter the state PROCEDURE TRANSACTION INACTIVE. The UE should ensure that the procedure transaction
identity (PTI) assigned to this procedure is not released immediately. The way to achieve this is implementation
dependent. While the PTI value is not released, the UE regards any received ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER
CONTEXT REQUEST or MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST or DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER
CONTEXT REQUEST message with the same PTI value as a network retransmission (see subclause 7.3.1).

   i) If the ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message is received, the UE shall
      verify that the EPS bearer identity given in the EPS bearer identity IE is not already used by any EPS bearer
      context. The UE shall then proceed as described in subclause 6.4.2.3 or subclause 6.4.2.4.

   ii) If the MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message is received, the UE verifies that the EPS bearer
       identity given in the EPS bearer identity IE is any of the active EPS bearer contexts. The UE shall then proceed
       as described in subclause 6.4.3.3 or subclause 6.4.3.4.

   iii) If the DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message is received, the UE verifies that the EPS
        bearer identity given in the EPS bearer identity IE is one of the active EPS bearer contexts. The UE shall then
        proceed as described in subclause 6.4.4.3.

In case i, after successful completion of the dedicated EPS bearer context activation procedure, the network may initiate
an EPS bearer context modification procedure to delete the packet filters which have packet filter identifiers indicated
by the UE in the Traffic flow aggregate IE in the BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST message and
for which the network created new packet filters during the dedicated EPS bearer context activation procedure. In this
case the MME shall set the procedure transaction identity value in the MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST
message to "no procedure transaction identity assigned".

6.5.4.4           UE requested bearer resource modification procedure not accepted by the
                  network

6.5.4.4.1            General
If the bearer resource modification requested cannot be accepted by the network, the MME shall send a BEARER
RESOURCE MODIFICATION REJECT message to the UE. The message shall contain the PTI and an ESM cause
value indicating the reason for rejecting the UE requested bearer resource modification.

The ESM cause value typically indicates one of the following:

   #26:   insufficient resources;

   #30:   request rejected by Serving GW or PDN GW;

   #31:   request rejected, unspecified;

   #45:   syntactical error(s) in packet filter(s);

   #56:   collision with network initiated request;

   #59:   unsupported QCI value;

   #60:   bearer handling not supported; or

   #95 – 111:    protocol errors.

If the bearer resource modification requested is for an established LIPA PDN connection or SIPTO at the local network
PDN connection, then the network shall reply with a BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REJECT message with
ESM cause #60 "bearer handling not supported".

If the requested new TFT is not available, then the BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REJECT message shall be
sent.

The TFT in the request message is checked by the network for different types of TFT IE errors as follows:

   a) Semantic errors in TFT operations:

      1) When the TFT operation is an operation other than "Replace packet filters in existing TFT", "Add packet
         filters to existing TFT", "Delete packet filters from existing TFT" or "No TFT operation".

      2) When the TFT operation is "Replace packet filters in existing TFT", "Add packet filters to existing TFT" or
         "Delete packet filters from existing TFT" and there is no TFT for the default EPS bearer context.

      3) TFT operation = "Delete packet filters from existing TFT" when it would render the TFT empty.

       In case 1 the network shall reject the modification request with ESM cause #41 "semantic error in the TFT
       operation".

       In case 2, if the TFT operation is "Delete packet filters from existing TFT", the network shall further process the
       new request and, if no error according to items b, c, and d was detected, shall perform an EPS bearer context
       modification procedure including the value of EPS bearer identity for packet filter IE in the EPS bearer identity
       IE and a TFT IE with TFT operation = "Delete existing TFT" in the MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT
       REQUEST message.

       In case 2, if the TFT operation is "Replace packet filters in existing TFT" or "Add packet filters to existing TFT",
       the network shall process the new request as a request with TFT operation = "Create a new TFT".

       In case 3, if the packet filters belong to a dedicated EPS bearer context, the network shall process the new
       deletion request and, if no error according to items b, c, and d was detected, delete the existing TFT. After
       successful deletion of the TFT, the network shall perform an EPS bearer context deactivation request procedure
       to deactivate the dedicated EPS bearer context between the UE and the network.

       In case 3, if the packet filters belong to the default EPS bearer context, the network shall process the new
       deletion request and if no error according to items b, c, and d was detected then perform an EPS bearer context

      modification procedure to remove the existing TFT of the default EPS bearer context, this corresponds to using
      match-all packet filter for the default EPS bearer context.

   b) Syntactical errors in TFT operations:

      1) When the TFT operation = "Replace packet filters in existing TFT", "Add packet filters to existing TFT" or
         "Delete packet filters from existing TFT", and the packet filter list in the TFT IE is empty.

      2) TFT operation = "No TFT operation" with a non-empty packet filter list in the TFT IE.

      3) TFT operation = "Replace packet filters in existing TFT" when the packet filter to be replaced does not exist
         in the original TFT.

      4) TFT operation = "Delete packet filters from existing TFT" when the packet filter to be deleted does not exist
         in the original TFT.

      5) TFT operation = "Delete packet filters from existing TFT" with a packet filter list also including packet
         filters in addition to the packet filter identifiers.

      6) When there are other types of syntactical errors in the coding of the TFT IE, such as a mismatch between the
         number of packet filters subfield, and the number of packet filters in the packet filter list.

      7) TFT operation = "No TFT operation" with an empty parameters list.

      In case 3 the network shall not diagnose an error, shall further process the replace request and, if no error
      according to items c and d was detected, shall perform an EPS bearer context modification procedure using TFT
      operation = "Add packet filters to existing TFT" to include the packet filters received to the existing TFT.

      In case 4 the network shall not diagnose an error, shall further process the deletion request and, if no error
      according to items c and d was detected, shall perform an EPS bearer context modification procedure including
      the value of EPS bearer identity for packet filter IE in the EPS bearer identity IE and a TFT IE with TFT
      operation = "Delete packet filters from existing TFT" and the received packet filter identifier(s) in the MODIFY
      EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message.

      Otherwise the network shall reject the modification request with ESM cause #42 "syntactical error in the TFT
      operation".

   c) Semantic errors in packet filters:

      1) When a packet filter consists of conflicting packet filter components which would render the packet filter
         ineffective, i.e. no IP packet will ever fit this packet filter. How the network determines a semantic error in a
         packet filter is outside the scope of the present document.

      2) When the resulting TFT, which is assigned to a dedicated EPS bearer context, does not contain any packet
         filter applicable for the uplink direction.

      The network shall reject the modification request with ESM cause #44 "semantic errors in packet filter(s)".

   d) Syntactical errors in packet filters:

      1) When the TFT operation = "Replace packet filters in existing TFT" and two or more packet filters in all
         TFTs associated with the PDN connection would have identical packet filter precedence values.

      2) When there are other types of syntactical errors in the coding of packet filters, such as the use of a reserved
         value for a packet filter component identifier.

      In case 1, if the old packet filters do not belong to the default EPS bearer context, the network shall not diagnose
      an error, shall further process the new request and, if it was processed successfully, shall delete the old packet
      filters which have identical filter precedence values. Furthermore, the network shall perform an EPS bearer
      context deactivation procedure to deactivate the dedicated EPS bearer context(s) for which it has deleted the
      packet filters.

      In case 1, if one or more old packet filters belong to the default EPS bearer context, the network shall release the
      relevant PDN connection using the EPS bearer context deactivation procedure. If the relevant PDN connection is
      the last one and EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is not supported by the UE or the MME, the
      network shall detach the UE using detach type "re-attach required".

       Otherwise the network shall reject the modification request with ESM cause #45 "syntactical errors in packet
       filter(s)".

The network may include a Back-off timer value IE in the BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REJECT message.

The network shall not include the ESM cause value #26 "insufficient resources" in the BEARER RESOURCE
MODIFICATION REJECT message due to APN based congestion control being active.

If the Back-off timer value IE is included and the ESM cause value is not #26 "insufficient resources", the network may
include the Re-attempt indicator IE to indicate whether the UE is allowed to attempt a PDP context modification
procedure in the PLMN for the same APN in A/Gb or Iu mode, and whether another attempt in A/Gb and Iu mode or in
S1 mode is allowed in an equivalent PLMN.

Upon receipt of a BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REJECT message, the UE shall stop the timer T3481,
release the traffic flow aggregate description associated to the PTI value, and enter the state PROCEDURE
TRANSACTION INACTIVE. If the ESM cause included in the BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REJECT
message is #43 "invalid EPS bearer identity", the UE locally deactivates the EPS bearer context(s) without peer-to-peer
ESM signalling.

6.5.4.4.2            Handling of network rejection due to ESM cause #26
If the ESM cause value is #26 "insufficient resources" and the Back-off timer value IE is included, the UE shall ignore
the Re-attempt indicator IE provided by the network, if any, and take different actions depending on the timer value
received for timer T3396 in the Back-off timer value IE (if the UE is configured for dual priority, exceptions are
specified in subclause 6.5.5; if the UE is a UE configured to use AC11 – 15 in selected PLMN, exceptions are specified
in subclause 6.3.5):

   i) if the timer value indicates neither zero nor deactivated, the UE shall stop timer T3396 associated with the
      corresponding APN, if it is running. The UE shall then start T3396 with the value provided in the Back-off timer
      value IE and not send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST, BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION
      REQUEST with exception of those identified in subclause 6.5.4.1, or BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION
      REQUEST message for the same APN until timer T3396 expires or timer T3396 is stopped. If the UE did not
      provide an APN for the establishment of the PDN connection and the request type was different from
      "emergency" and from "handover of emergency bearer services", the UE shall stop the timer T3396 associated
      with no APN if it is running. The UE shall start timer T3396 with the received value and not send another PDN
      CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message without an APN and with request type different from "emergency" and
      from "handover of emergency bearer services", or another BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST
      with exception of those identified in subclause 6.5.4.1, or BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST
      message for a non-emergency PDN connection established without an APN provided by the UE, until timer
      T3396 expires or timer T3396 is stopped. The UE shall not stop timer T3396 upon a PLMN change or inter-
      system change;

   ii) if the timer value indicates that this timer is deactivated, the UE shall not send another PDN CONNECTIVITY
       REQUEST, BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST with exception of those identified in
       subclause 6.5.4.1, or BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST message for the same APN until the
       UE is switched off or the USIM is removed or the UE receives an ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER
       CONTEXT REQUEST, ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST or MODIFY EPS
       BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message for the same APN from the network or a DEACTIVATE EPS
       BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message including ESM cause #39 "reactivation requested" for a default EPS
       bearer context for the same APN from the network. If the UE did not provide an APN for the establishment of
       the PDN connection and the request type was different from "emergency" and from "handover of emergency
       bearer services", the UE shall not send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message without an APN
       and with request type different from "emergency" and from "handover of emergency bearer services", or another
       BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST with exception of those identified in subclause 6.5.4.1, or
       BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST message for a non-emergency PDN connection established
       without APN provided by the UE, until the UE is switched off or the USIM is removed, or the UE receives an
       ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST, ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER
       CONTEXT REQUEST or MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message for a non-emergency PDN
       connection established without an APN provided by the UE, or a DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER CONTEXT
       REQUEST message including ESM cause #39 "reactivation requested" for a default EPS bearer context of a
       non-emergency PDN connection established without an APN provided by the UE. The timer T3396 remains
       deactivated upon a PLMN change or inter-system change; or

   iii) if the timer value indicates zero, the UE:

       -   shall stop timer T3396 associated with the corresponding APN, if running, and may send another PDN
           CONNECTIVITY REQUEST, BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST or BEARER
           RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST message for the same APN; and

       -   if the UE did not provide an APN for the establishment of the PDN connection and the request type was
           different from "emergency" and from "handover of emergency bearer services", the UE shall stop timer
           T3396 associated with no APN, if running, and may send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST
           message without an APN, or another BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST or BEARER
           RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST message for a non-emergency PDN connection established without
           an APN provided by the UE.

If the Back-off timer value IE is not included, the UE may send a PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST, BEARER
RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST or BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST messages for the
same APN.

The further actions to be performed by the UE are implementation dependent as part of upper layers responsibility.

If the timer T3396 is running when the UE enters state EMM-DEREGISTERED, the UE remains switched on, and the
USIM in the UE remains the same, then timer T3396 is kept running until it expires or it is stopped.

If the UE is switched off when the timer T3396 is running, and if the USIM in the UE remains the same when the UE is
switched on, the UE behaves as follows:

   -   let t1 be the time remaining for T3396 timeout at switch off and let t be the time elapsed between switch off and
       switch on. If t1 is greater than t, then the timer shall be restarted with the value t1 – t. If t1 is equal to or less than
       t, then the timer need not be restarted. If the UE is not capable of determining t, then the UE shall restart the
       timer with the value t1;

   -   if prior to switch off, timer T3396 was running for a specific APN, because a PDN CONNECTIVITY
       REQUEST, BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST or BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION
       REQUEST message containing the low priority indicator set to "MS is configured for NAS signalling low
       priority" was rejected with a timer value for timer T3396, and if timer T3396 is restarted at switch on, then the
       UE configured for dual priority shall handle session management requests as indicated in subclause 6.5.5; and

   -   if prior to switch off timer T3396 was running because a PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST without APN sent
       together with an ATTACH REQUEST message containing the low priority indicator set to "MS is configured for
       NAS signalling low priority" was rejected with a timer value for timer T3396, and if timer T3396 is restarted at
       switch on, then the UE configured for dual priority shall handle session management requests as indicated in
       subclause 6.5.5.

6.5.4.4.3             Handling of network rejection due to ESM cause other than ESM cause #26
If the ESM cause value is not #26 "insufficient resources", and the Back-off timer value IE is included, the UE shall
behave as follows depending on the timer value received in the Back-off timer value IE (if the UE is a UE configured to
use AC11 – 15 in selected PLMN, exceptions are specified in subclause 6.3.6):

   -   if the timer value indicates neither zero nor deactivated, the UE shall start the back-off timer with the value
       provided in the Back-off timer value IE for the bearer resource modification procedure and PLMN and APN
       combination and not send another BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST message with
       exception of those identified in subclause 6.5.4.1, in the PLMN for the same APN until the back-off timer
       expires, the UE is switched off or the USIM is removed;

   -   if the timer value indicates that this timer is deactivated, the UE shall not send another BEARER RESOURCE
       MODIFICATION REQUEST message with exception of those identified in subclause 6.5.4.1, in the PLMN for
       the same APN until the UE is switched off or the USIM is removed; and

   -   if the timer value indicates zero, the UE may send another BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST
       message in the PLMN for the same APN.

If the Back-off timer value IE is not included, then the UE shall ignore the Re-attempt indicator IE provided by the
network, if any.

3GPP TS 24.301 version 15.8.0 Release 15                  289                       ETSI TS 124 301 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


   1) Additionally, if the ESM cause value is #32 "service option not supported", or #33 "requested service option not
      subscribed", the UE shall proceed as follows:

      -   if the UE is registered in the HPLMN or in a PLMN that is within the EHPLMN list, the UE shall behave as
          described above in the present subclause, using the configured SM_RetryWaitTime value as specified in
          3GPP TS 24.368 [15A] or in USIM file NASCONFIG as specified in 3GPP TS 31.102 [17], if available, as
          back-off timer value; and

      -   otherwise, if the UE is not registered in its HPLMN or a PLMN that is within the EHPLMN list or the
          SM_RetryWaitTime value is not configured, the UE shall behave as described above in the present
          subclause, using the default value of 12 minutes for the back-off timer.

   2) For ESM cause values different from #32 "service option not supported", or #33 "requested service option not
      subscribed", the UE behaviour regarding the start of a back-off timer is unspecified.

The UE shall not stop any back-off timer upon a PLMN change or inter-system change. If the network indicates that a
back-off timer for the bearer resource allocation procedure and PLMN and APN combination is deactivated, then it
remains deactivated upon a PLMN change or inter-system change.

   NOTE 1: This means the back-off timer can still be running or be deactivated for the given ESM procedure and
           PLMN and APN combination when the UE returns to the PLMN or when it performs inter-system change
           back from A/Gb or Iu mode to S1 mode. Thus the UE can still be prevented from sending another
           BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST message with exception of those identified in
           subclause 6.5.4.1, in the PLMN for the same APN.

If the back-off timer is started upon receipt of BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REJECT (i.e. the timer value
was provided by the network, a configured value is available or the default value is used as explained above) or the
back-off timer is deactivated, the UE behaves as follows:

   1) after a PLMN change the UE may send a BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST message for the
      same APN in the new PLMN, if the back-off timer is not running and is not deactivated for the bearer resource
      modification procedure and the combination of new PLMN and APN;

      Furthermore as an implementation option, for the ESM cause values #32 "service option not supported" or #33
      "requested service option not subscribed", if the network does not include a Re-attempt indicator IE, the UE may
      decide not to automatically send another BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST message for the
      same APN that was sent by the UE, if the UE is registered to a new PLMN which is in the list of equivalent
      PLMNs.

   2) if the network does not include the Re-attempt indicator IE to indicate whether re-attempt in A/Gb or Iu mode is
      allowed, or the UE ignores the Re-attempt indicator IE, e.g. because the Back-off timer value IE is not included,
      then:

      -   if the UE is registered in its HPLMN or in a PLMN that is within the EHPLMN list, the UE shall apply the
          configured SM_RetryAtRATChange value as specified in 3GPP TS 24.368 [15A] or in USIM file
          NASCONFIG as specified in 3GPP TS 31.102 [17], if available, to determine whether the UE may attempt a
          PDP context modification procedure for the same PLMN and APN combination in A/Gb or Iu mode; and

      -   if the UE is not registered in its HPLMN or in a PLMN that is within the EHPLMN list, or if the NAS
          configuration MO as specified in 3GPP TS 24.368 [15A] is not available and the value for inter-system
          change is not configured in the USIM file NASCONFIG, then the UE behaviour regarding a PDP context
          modification procedure for the same PLMN and APN combination in A/Gb or Iu mode is unspecified; and

   3) if the network includes the Re-attempt indicator IE indicating that re-attempt in an equivalent PLMN is not
      allowed, then depending on the timer value received in the Back-off timer value IE, for each combination of a
      PLMN from the equivalent PLMN list and the APN the UE shall start a back-off timer for the bearer resource
      modification procedure with the value provided by the network, or deactivate the respective back-off timer as
      follows:

      -   If the Re-attempt indicator IE additionally indicates that re-attempt in A/Gb or Iu mode is allowed, the UE
          shall start or deactivate the back-off timer for A/Gb and Iu mode only; and

      -   otherwise the UE shall start or deactivate the back-off timer for A/Gb, Iu, and S1 mode.

If the back-off timer for a PLMN and APN combination was started or deactivated upon receipt of an MODIFY PDP
CONTEXT REJECT message (see 3GPP TS 24.008 [13]) and the network indicated that re-attempt in S1 mode is
allowed, then this back-off timer does not prevent the UE from sending a BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION
REQUEST message in this PLMN for the same APN after inter-system change to S1 mode. If the network indicated
that re-attempt in S1 mode is not allowed, the UE shall not send any BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION
REQUEST message in this PLMN for the same APN after inter-system change to S1 mode until the timer expires, the
UE is switched off or the USIM is removed.

   NOTE 2: The back-off timer is used to describe a logical model of the required UE behaviour. This model does not
           imply any specific implementation, e.g. as a timer or timestamp.

   NOTE 3: Reference to back-off timer in this section can either refer to use of timer T3396 or to use of a different
           packet system specific timer within the UE. Whether the UE uses T3396 as a back-off timer or it uses
           different packet system specific timers as back-off timers is left up to UE implementation. This back-off
           timer is stopped when the UE is switched off or the USIM is removed.

The further actions to be performed by the UE are implementation dependent as part of upper layers responsibility.

6.5.4.5           Abnormal cases in the UE
The following abnormal cases can be identified:

   a) Expiry of timer T3481:

       On the first expiry of the timer T3481, the UE shall resend the BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION
       REQUEST and shall reset and restart timer T3481. This retransmission is repeated four times, i.e. on the fifth
       expiry of timer T3481, the UE shall abort the procedure, release the PTI allocated for this activation and enter
       the state PROCEDURE TRANSACTION INACTIVE. In addition, if the UE had initiated resource release for all
       the traffic flows for the bearer, it shall deactivate the EPS bearer context locally without peer-to-peer signalling
       between the UE and the MME. In order to synchronize the EPS bearer context status with the MME, on
       indication of "back to E-UTRAN coverage" from the lower layers, the UE shall send a TRACKING AREA
       UPDATE REQUEST message that includes the EPS bearer context status IE to the MME.

   b) Unknown EPS bearer context

       Upon receipt of the BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REJECT message including ESM cause #43
       "invalid EPS bearer identity", the UE shall deactivate the existing EPS bearer context locally without peer-to-
       peer signalling between the UE and the MME.

   c) Collision of a UE requested bearer resource modification procedure and an EPS bearer context deactivation
      procedure.

       When the UE receives a DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message during the bearer
       resource modification procedure, and the EPS bearer identity indicated in the DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER
       CONTEXT REQUEST message is a EPS bearer context the UE indicated in the UE requested bearer resource
       modification procedure, then the UE shall abort the UE requested bearer resource modification procedure and
       proceed with the EPS bearer context deactivation procedure.

   d) Rejection of a UE requested bearer resource modification procedure when the UE has initiated the procedure to
      release all traffic flows for the bearer

       Upon receipt of a BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REJECT message with ESM cause value #31
       "request rejected, unspecified", if the UE had initiated resource release for all the traffic flows for the bearer, it
       shall deactivate the EPS bearer context locally without peer-to-peer signalling between the UE and the MME. In
       order to synchronize the EPS bearer context status with the MME, the UE may send a TRACKING AREA
       UPDATE REQUEST message that includes the EPS bearer context status IE to the MME.

6.5.4.6           Abnormal cases on the network side
The following abnormal cases can be identified:

   a) Unknown EPS bearer context

       If the EPS bearer identity provided in the EPS bearer identity for packet filter IE in the BEARER RESOURCE
       MODIFICATION REQUEST message indicates an EPS bearer identity value and this does not belong to any
       already activated EPS bearer context, the MME shall reply with a BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION
       REJECT message with ESM cause #43 "invalid EPS bearer identity".

   b) BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST message received for a PDN connection established for
      emergency bearer services:

       The MME shall reply with a BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REJECT message with ESM cause #30
       "request rejected by Serving GW or PDN GW".


6.5.5         Handling session management request for UE configured for dual
              priority
If timer T3396 is running for a specific APN due to one of the following reasons:

   -   a PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST, BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST or BEARER
       RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST message containing the low priority indicator set to "MS is configured
       for NAS signalling low priority" was rejected with a timer value for timer T3396 and ESM cause value #26
       "insufficient resources";

   -   a DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message was received with a timer value for timer
       T3396 and ESM cause value #26 "insufficient resources" for a PDN connection established with low priority
       indicator set to "MS is configured for NAS signalling low priority", or

   -   because the UE received a DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message containing a timer
       value for timer T3396 and ESM cause value #26 "insufficient resources" for a PDN connection established with
       low priority indicator set to "MS is configured for NAS signalling low priority",

upon request of the upper layers the UE can:

   -   send a PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message to the same APN, with low priority indicator set to "MS is
       not configured for NAS signalling low priority"; or,

   -   send a BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST or BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION
       REQUEST message, with low priority indicator set to "MS is not configured for NAS signalling low priority",
       for a PDN connection established with low priority indicator set to "MS is not configured for NAS signalling
       low priority" exists.

If timer T3396 is running, because any of the following messages containing the low priority indicator set to "MS is
configured for NAS signalling low priority" was rejected with a timer value for timer T3396 and ESM cause value #26
"insufficient resources":

   -   a PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST without APN and with request type different from "emergency" and from
       "handover of emergency bearer services", sent together with an ATTACH REQUEST message;

   -   a stand-alone PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message without APN and with request type different from
       "emergency" and from "handover of emergency bearer services"; or

   -   a BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST or BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST
       message sent for a non-emergency PDN connection established without APN provided by the UE,

or because the UE received a DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message containing a timer value
for timer T3396 and ESM cause value #26 "insufficient resources" for a non-emergency PDN connection established
without APN provided by the UE and established with low priority indicator set to "MS is configured for NAS
signalling low priority", then upon request of the upper layers the UE can initiate a new attach procedure or stand-alone
PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST procedure without APN and with request type different from "emergency" and
from "handover of emergency bearer services", with low priority indicator set to "MS is not configured for NAS
signalling low priority".

For requests with low priority indicator set to "MS is configured for NAS signalling low priority", the UE shall follow
the procedures specified in subclause 6.5.1.4.

6.6           Miscellaneous procedures
6.6.1         Exchange of protocol configuration options

6.6.1.1          General
The UE and the PDN GW can exchange protocol configuration options via the dedicated ESM information request
procedure or via other ESM procedures.

If supported by the network and UE end-to-end for a PDN connection, protocol configuration options shall be
exchanged via the extended protocol configuration options IE. Otherwise the protocol configuration options IE is used.

   NOTE 1: In this version of the protocol inter-system mobility to and from NB-S1 mode is supported. During inter-
           system-mobility from NB-S1 mode to WB-S1 mode the end-to-end support of the extended protocol
           configuration options IE can be lost, e.g. if the new MME does not support the extended protocol
           configuration options IE.

For the UE, the extended protocol configuration options is supported by the network and the UE end-to-end for a PDN
connection if

   -   the UE is in NB-S1 mode;

   -   the PDN Type requested for the PDN connection is non-IP;

   -   the UE supports N1 mode and the network has included the extended protocol configuration options IE in at
       least one EPS session management message received by the UE for this PDN connection; or

   -   the network has indicated support of the extended protocol configuration options IE in the last ATTACH
       ACCEPT or TRACKING AREA UPDATING ACCEPT message and the network has included the extended
       protocol configuration options IE in at least one EPS session management message received by the UE for this
       PDN connection.

For the MME, the extended protocol configuration options is supported by the network and the UE end-to-end for a
PDN connection if

   -   the UE is in NB-S1 mode;

   -   the PDN Type requested for the PDN connection is non-IP;

   -   the MME supports inter-system change with 5GS; or

   -   the UE has indicated support of the extended protocol configuration options IE in the last ATTACH REQUEST
       or TRACKING AREA UPDATING REQUEST message, and the MME has received the extended protocol
       configuration options IE in at least one message sent by the PDN GW towards the UE for this PDN connection
       (for details see 3GPP TS 29.274 [16D]).

   NOTE 2: For the PDN GW, the extended protocol configuration options is supported by the network and the UE
           end-to-end for a PDN connection if the last support indication received from the MME or S-GW indicates
           that extended protocol configuration options is supported for this PDN connection (for details see
           3GPP TS 29.274 [16D]).

6.6.1.2          ESM information request procedure

6.6.1.2.1            General
The ESM information request procedure is used by the network to retrieve ESM information, i.e. protocol configuration
options, APN, or both from the UE during the attach procedure if the UE indicated in the PDN CONNECTIVITY
REQUEST message that it has ESM information that needs to be sent security protected. The purpose of this procedure
is to provide privacy for the ESM information if ciphering is enabled in the network.

6.6.1.2.2            ESM information request initiated by the network
The network intiates the ESM information request procedure by sending a ESM INFORMATION REQUEST message
to the UE, starting timer T3489 and entering the state PROCEDURE TRANSACTION PENDING (see example in
figure 6.6.1.2.2.1). This message shall be sent only after the security context has been setup, and if the ESM information
transfer flag has been set in the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message. The MME shall set the EPS bearer
identity of the ESM INFORMATION REQUEST message to the value "no EPS bearer identity assigned" and include
the PTI from the associated PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message.

6.6.1.2.3            ESM information request completion by the UE
Upon receipt of the ESM INFORMATION REQUEST message, the UE shall send an ESM INFORMATION
RESPONSE message to the network. The UE shall include all the protocol configuration options that need to be
transferred security protected, and APN if required, to the network in the ESM INFORMATION RESPONSE message.
The UE shall set the EPS bearer identity of the ESM INFORMATION RESPONSE message to the value "no EPS
bearer identity assigned" and include the PTI from the ESM INFORMATION REQUEST message.

6.6.1.2.4            ESM information request completion by the network
Upon receipt of the ESM INFORMATION RESPONSE message, the network shall stop timer T3489 and enter the
state PROCEDURE TRANSACTION INACTIVE. A protocol configuration options IE or extended protocol
configuration options IE included in the ESM INFORMATION RESPONSE message replaces any protocol
configuration options IE or extended protocol configuration options IE that the network previously may have received
during the attach procedure execution.

6.6.1.2.5            Abnormal cases in the UE
Apart from the case described in subclause 6.3.3, no abnormal cases have been identified.

6.6.1.2.6            Abnormal cases on the network side
The following abnormal cases can be identified:

   a) Expiry of timer T3489:

       On the first expiry of the timer T3489, the MME shall resend the ESM INFORMATION REQUEST message
       and shall reset and restart timer T3489. This retransmission is repeated two times, i.e. on the third expiry of timer
       T3489, the MME shall abort the procedure, release any resources for this procedure and reject the associated
       PDN connectivity procedure including the ESM cause #53 "ESM information not received", in the PDN
       CONNECTIVITY REJECT message.

6.6.1.3          Exchange of protocol configuration options in other messages
The UE may include a protocol configuration options IE or extended protocol configuration options IE on EPS bearer
context activation, EPS bearer context deactivation, EPS bearer context modification, PDN connectivity request, PDN
disconnect request, bearer resource allocation request and bearer resource modification request if the UE wishes to

particular, the UE may use this procedure on EPS bearer context activation to perform the MSISDN notification
procedure as specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 [13], subclause 6.4.

The PDN GW or the SCEF may include a protocol configuration options IE or extended protocol configuration options
IE on EPS bearer context activation, EPS bearer context deactivation, EPS bearer context modification, PDN
connectivity reject, PDN disconnect reject, bearer resource allocation reject and bearer resource modification reject if
the PDN GW or the SCEF wishes to transmit (protocol) data (e.g. configuration parameters, error codes or
messages/events) to the UE. In particular, the PDN GW may use this procedure on EPS bearer context activation to
perform the MSISDN notification procedure as specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 [13], subclause 6.4.


6.6.2         Notification procedure

6.6.2.1           General
The network can use the notification procedure to inform the UE about events which are relevant for the upper layer
which is using an EPS bearer context or has requested a procedure transaction.

If the UE has indicated that it supports the notification procedure, the network may initiate the procedure at any time
while a PDN connection exists or a procedure transaction is ongoing.

6.6.2.2           Notification procedure initiation by the network
The network initiates the notification procedure by sending a NOTIFICATION message to the UE (see example in
figure 6.6.2.2.1).




                                     Figure 6.6.2.2.1: Notification procedure


6.6.2.3           Notification procedure in the UE
When the UE receives a NOTIFICATION message, the ESM protocol entity in the UE shall provide the notification
indicator to the upper layer.

The notification indicator can have the following value:

   #1: SRVCC handover cancelled, IMS session re-establishment required.

6.6.2.4           Abnormal cases on the network side
The following abnormal case can be identified:

   a) Lower layer indication of non-delivered NAS PDU due to handover

       If the NOTIFICATION message could not be delivered due to an intra MME handover, then upon successful
       completion of the intra MME handover the MME shall retransmit the NOTIFICATION message. If a failure of
       the handover procedure is reported by the lower layer and the S1 signalling connection exists, the MME shall
       retransmit the NOTIFICATION message.

6.6.3        Remote UE Report procedure

6.6.3.1          General
The purpose of the Remote UE Report procedure is for a UE acting as ProSe UE-to-network relay to notify the network
that a remote UE is connected to the ProSe UE-to-network relay or disconnected from the ProSe UE-to-network relay
as specified in 3GPP TS 23.303 [31].

6.6.3.2          Remote UE Report initiated by the UE
The UE initiates the Remote UE Report procedure by sending a REMOTE UE REPORT message to the network,
starting timer T3493 and entering the state PROCEDURE TRANSACTION PENDING (see example in
figure 6.6.3.2.1). The UE shall include information of newly connected or disconnected remote UEs to the network in
the REMOTE UE REPORT message. If any encrypted IMSI remote UE identity is included in the REMOTE UE
REPORT message, the UE shall include the corresponding ProSe Key Management Function address. The UE shall
include the default EPS bearer identity of the PDN connection associated with the remote UE connected to the ProSe
UE-to-network relay or disconnected from the ProSe UE-to-network relay.

   NOTE:     Encrypted IMSI remote UE identities corresponding to different ProSe Key Management Function
             addresses need to be reported using separate REMOTE UE REPORT messages.

6.6.3.3          Remote UE Report completion by the network
Upon receipt of the REMOTE UE REPORT message, the MME shall send an REMOTE UE REPORT RESPONSE
message to the UE. The MME shall include the PTI from the REMOTE UE REPORT message.

6.6.3.4          Remote UE Report completion by the UE
Upon receipt of the REMOTE UE REPORT RESPONSE message, the UE shall stop timer T3493 and enter the state
PROCEDURE TRANSACTION INACTIVE.

6.6.3.5          Abnormal cases in the UE
The following abnormal cases can be identified:

   a) Expiry of timer T3493:

      On the first expiry of the timer T3493, the UE shall resend the REMOTE UE REPORT message and shall reset
      and restart timer T3493. This retransmission is repeated two times, i.e. on the third expiry of timer T3493, the
      UE shall abort the procedure and release any resources for this procedure.

   NOTE:     After the abortion of the Remote UE Report procedure, the Remote UE Report procedure for the remote
             UE(s) can be restarted and how to restart the procedure is left to UE implementation.

6.6.4         Transport of user data via the control plane procedure

6.6.4.1           General
The purpose of the transport of user data via the control plane procedure is to transfer user data via the control plane in
an encapsulated form between the UE and the MME.

The procedure may be initiated by the UE or the network when the UE is in EMM-CONNECTED mode.

The procedure may also be initiated by the UE in EMM-IDLE mode by including the ESM DATA TRANSPORT
message in a CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message.

6.6.4.2           UE initiated transport of user data via the control plane
Upon receipt of a request to transfer user data via the control plane, if the UE is in EMM-CONNECTED mode, the UE
initiates the procedure by sending the ESM DATA TRANSPORT message including the user data to be sent in the User
data container IE (see example in figure 6.6.4.2.1). The length of the value part of the User data container IE should not
exceed the link MTU size for the respective type of user data (IPv4, IPv6 or Non-IP).

   NOTE:      The recommended maximum size for link MTU is 1358 octets to prevent fragmentation in the backbone
              network (see 3GPP TS 23.060 [74]). Depending on the network configuration, setting link MTU size to a
              value larger than 1358 octets could lead to inefficient core network implementation due to fragmentation.

If the UE is in EMM-IDLE mode, the UE initiates the procedure by sending the ESM DATA TRANSPORT message
included in a CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message.

Based on information provided by the upper layers, the UE may include a Release assistance indication IE in the ESM
DATA TRANSPORT message to inform the network that

   1) subsequent to the current uplink data transmission no further uplink or downlink data transmission (e.g. an
      acknowledgement or response) is expected; i.e. the upper layers indicated that data exchanges have completed
      with the current UL data transfer; or

   2) subsequent to the current uplink data transmission only a single downlink data transmission and no further
      uplink data transmission is expected; i.e. the upper layers indicated that data exchanges will have completed with
      the next downlink data transmission.

When receiving the ESM DATA TRANSPORT message, the MME shall identify the PDN connection to the SCEF or
to the PDN GW, based on the EPS bearer identity included in message, and forward the contents of the User data
container IE accordingly. If the ESM DATA TRANSPORT message includes a Release assistance indication IE, then
ESM layer indicates to the EMM layer to initiate release of the NAS signalling connection,

   1) if the release assistance indication indicates that no further uplink or downlink data transmission subsequent to
      the uplink data transmission is expected; or,

   2) upon subsequent delivery of the next received downlink data transmission to the UE if the release assistance
      indication indicates that only a single downlink data transmission and no further uplink data transmission
      subsequent to the uplink data transmission is expected.

6.6.4.3            Network initiated transport of user data via the control plane
The network initiates the procedure by sending the ESM DATA TRANSPORT message (see example in
figure 6.6.4.3.1). Upon receiving the ESM DATA TRANSPORT message, the UE shall:

   -   forward the contents of the User data container IE to the upper layers.




           Figure 6.6.4.3.1: Network initiated transport of user data via the control plane procedure


6.6.4.4            Abnormal cases in the UE
The following abnormal case can be identified:

   a) T3396 is running

       The UE shall not send an ESM DATA TRANSPORT message unless

       -     the UE is a UE configured to use AC11 – 15 in selected PLMN; or

       -     the ESM DATA TRANSPORT message is used for an exception data reporting and the UE is allowed to use
             exception data reporting (see the ExceptionDataReportingAllowed leaf of the NAS configuration MO in
             3GPP TS 24.368 [15A] or the USIM file EFNASCONFIG in 3GPP TS 31.102 [17]).

       The ESM DATA TRANSPORT message can be sent, if still necessary, when timer T3396 expires or is stopped.

   b) Transmission failure of the ESM DATA TRANSPORT message indication from lower layers

       If lower layers indicate a TAI change and the current TAI is not in the TAI list, the transport of user data via the
       control plane procedure shall be aborted and re-initiated after successfully performing a tracking area updating
       procedure if the control plane CIoT EPS optimisation is still used and the user data exists. The "signalling
       active" flag shall be set in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message.

       If lower layers indicate a TAI change, but the current TAI is still part of the TAI list, or the TAI has not changed,
       the transport of user data via the control plane procedure shall be re-initiated immediately if the user data still
       exists by including the ESM DATA TRANSPORT message in a CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST
       message.

   NOTE:        How the ESM sublayer handles the retransmission of user data via the control plane is up to the UE
                implementation.

   c) NAS-MAC calculation indication from lower layers

      If lower layers indicate to calculate an NAS-MAC, the UE shall calculate an NAS_MAC as specified in
      3GPP TS 33.401 [19] and then provide the calculated NAS_MAC and 5 least significant bits of the uplink NAS
      COUNT used to calculate the NAS-MAC to lower layers (see 3GPP TS 36.331 [22]). The UE shall increase the
      uplink NAS COUNT by one after the calculation of the NAS_MAC.

6.6.4.5          Abnormal cases on the network side
   Apart from the case described in subclause 6.3.4, no other abnormal cases have been identified.


6.7          Reception of an ESM STATUS message by an ESM entity
The purpose of the sending of the ESM STATUS message is to report at any time certain error conditions detected upon
receipt of ESM protocol data. The ESM STATUS message can be sent by both the MME and the UE (see example in
figure 6.7.1).

If the ESM entity of the UE receives an ESM STATUS message the UE shall take different actions depending on the
received ESM cause value:

   #43    (Invalid EPS bearer identity);

      The UE shall abort any ongoing ESM procedure related to the received EPS bearer identity, stop any related
      timer, and deactivate the corresponding EPS bearer context locally (without peer to peer signalling between the
      UE and the MME).

   #81    (Invalid PTI value);

      The UE shall abort any ongoing ESM procedure related to the received PTI value and stop any related timer.

   #97    (Message type non-existent or not implemented);

      The UE shall abort any ongoing ESM procedure related to the PTI or EPS bearer identity and stop any related
      timer.

On receipt of an ESM STATUS message with any other ESM cause value no state transition and no specific action shall
be taken as seen from the radio interface, i.e. local actions are possible.

If the ESM entity of the MME receives an ESM STATUS message the MME shall take different actions depending on
the received ESM cause value:

   #43    (Invalid EPS bearer identity);

      The MME shall abort any ongoing ESM procedure related to the received EPS bearer identity, stop any related
      timer, and deactivate the corresponding EPS bearer context locally (without peer to peer signalling between the
      MME and the UE).

   #81    (Invalid PTI value);

      The MME shall abort any ongoing ESM procedure related to the received PTI value and stop any related timer.

   #97    (Message type non-existent or not implemented);

      The MME shall abort any ongoing ESM procedure related to the PTI or EPS bearer identity and stop any related
      timer.

The local actions to be taken by the MME on receipt of an ESM STATUS message with any other ESM cause value are
implementation dependent.

7             Handling of unknown, unforeseen, and erroneous
              protocol data

7.1           General
The procedures specified in the present document apply to those messages which pass the checks described in this
subclause.

This subclause also specifies procedures for the handling of unknown, unforeseen, and erroneous protocol data by the
receiving entity. These procedures are called "error handling procedures", but in addition to providing recovery
mechanisms for error situations they define a compatibility mechanism for future extensions of the protocols.

Subclauses 7.1 to 7.8 shall be applied in order of precedence.

Most error handling procedures are mandatory for the UE.

Detailed error handling procedures in the network are implementation dependent and may vary from PLMN to PLMN.
However, when extensions of this protocol are developed, networks will be assumed to have the error handling that is
indicated in this subclause as mandatory ("shall") and that is indicated as strongly recommended ("should").

Also, the error handling of the network is only considered as mandatory or strongly recommended when certain
thresholds for errors are not reached during a dedicated connection.

For definition of semantical and syntactical errors see 3GPP TS 24.007 [12], subclause 11.4.2.


7.2           Message too short
When a message is received that is too short to contain a complete message type information element, that message
shall be ignored, cf. 3GPP TS 24.007 [12].


7.3           Unknown or unforeseen procedure transaction identity or
              EPS bearer identity
7.3.1         Procedure transaction identity
The following network procedures shall apply for handling an unknown, erroneous, or unforeseen PTI received in an
ESM message:

    a) If the network receives a PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message with an unassigned or reserved PTI value,
       the network shall respond with a PDN CONNECTIVITY REJECT message including ESM cause #81 "invalid
       PTI value".

      reserved PTI value, the network shall respond with a BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REJECT message
      including ESM cause #81 "invalid PTI value".

   d) If the network receives a BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST message with an unassigned or
      reserved PTI value, the network shall respond with a BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REJECT
      message including ESM cause #81 "invalid PTI value".

   e) If the network receives an ESM INFORMATION RESPONSE message which includes an unassigned or
      reserved PTI value, the network shall ignore the message. If the PTI is an assigned value that does not match the
      PTI in use for any ongoing transaction related procedure, the network shall respond with an ESM STATUS
      message including ESM cause #81 "invalid PTI value".

   f) If the network receives an ESM message other than those listed in items a through e above with a reserved PTI
      value, the network shall ignore the message.

The following UE procedures shall apply for handling an unknown, erroneous, or unforeseen PTI received in an ESM
message:

   a) If the UE receives a PDN CONNECTIVITY REJECT message in which the PTI value is an unassigned or
      reserved value, or an assigned value that does not match any PTI in use, the UE shall ignore the message.

   b) If the UE receives a PDN DISCONNECT REJECT message in which the PTI value is an unassigned or reserved
      value, or an assigned value that does not match any PTI in use, the UE shall ignore the message.

      the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message, the UE shall respond with an ESM STATUS message
      including ESM cause #47 "PTI mismatch".

   f) If the UE receives a NOTIFICATION message in which the PTI value is an unassigned value, the UE shall
      proceed as specified in subclause 7.3.2. If the PTI is a reserved value, the UE shall respond with an ESM
      STATUS message including ESM cause #81 "invalid PTI value". If the PTI is an assigned value that does not
      match any PTI in use, the UE shall respond with an ESM STATUS message including ESM cause #47 "PTI
      mismatch".

   g) If the UE receives an ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message in which the PTI
      value is an assigned value that does not match any PTI in use, if the UE detects that this request is a network
      retransmission of an already accepted request (see subclause 6.5.1.3) the UE shall respond with an ACTIVATE
      DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT ACCEPT message. Otherwise, the UE shall respond with an ACTIVATE

7.4           Unknown or unforeseen message type
If UE receives an EMM message or ESM message with message type not defined for the protocol discriminator (PD) or
not implemented by the receiver, it shall return a status message (EMM STATUS or ESM STATUS depending on the
PD) with cause #97 "message type non-existent or not implemented".

If the network receives an EMM or ESM message with message type not defined for the PD or not implemented by the
receiver in a protocol state where reception of an unsolicited message with the given PD from the UE is not foreseen in
the protocol, the network actions are implementation dependent. Otherwise, if the network receives a message with
message type not defined for the PD or not implemented by the receiver, it shall ignore the message except that it
should return a status message (EMM STATUS or ESM STATUS depending on the PD) with cause #97 "message type
non-existent or not implemented".

   NOTE:      A message type not defined for the PD in the given direction is regarded by the receiver as a message
              type not defined for the PD, see 3GPP TS 24.007 [12].

If the UE receives a message not compatible with the protocol state, the UE shall return a status message (EMM
STATUS or ESM STATUS depending on the PD) with cause #98 "message type not compatible with protocol state".

If the network receives a message not compatible with the protocol state, the network actions are implementation
dependent.

7.5           Non-semantical mandatory information element errors
7.5.1         Common procedures
When on receipt of a message,

   -   an "imperative message part" error; or

   -   a "missing mandatory IE" error

is diagnosed or when a message containing:

   -   a syntactically incorrect mandatory IE;

   -   an IE unknown in the message, but encoded as "comprehension required" (see 3GPP TS 24.007 [12]); or

   -   an out of sequence IE encoded as "comprehension required" (see 3GPP TS 24.007 [12]) is received,

the UE shall proceed as follows:

       If the message is not one of the messages listed in subclause 7.5.3, item a, b, c, or d, the UE shall return a status
       message (EMM STATUS or ESM STATUS depending on the PD) with cause #96 "invalid mandatory
       information"; and

the network shall proceed as follows:

       If the message is not one of the messages listed in subclause 7.5.3, item e, f, g or h, the network shall either:

          -   try to treat the message (the exact further actions are implementation dependent); or

          -   ignore the message except that it should return a status message (EMM STATUS or ESM STATUS
              depending on the PD) with cause #96 "invalid mandatory information".


7.5.2         EPS mobility management
No exceptional cases are described for mobility management messages.

No semantical or syntactical diagnosis other than presence and length shall be performed on the ESM message
container information element in the ATTACH REQUEST, ATTACH ACCEPT, ATTACH COMPLETE and
CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST messages.


7.5.3         EPS session management
The following UE procedures shall apply for handling an error encountered with a mandatory information element in an
ESM message:

   a) If the message is an ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST, an ACTIVATE DEFAULT
      EPS BEARER CONTEXT REJECT message with ESM cause #96 "invalid mandatory information", shall be
      returned.

   b) If the message is an ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST, an ACTIVATE
      DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REJECT message with ESM cause #96 "invalid mandatory
      information", shall be returned.

   c) If the message is a MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST, a MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT
      REJECT message with ESM cause #96 "invalid mandatory information", shall be returned.

   d) If the message is a DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST, a DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER
      CONTEXT ACCEPT message shall be returned. All resources associated with that EPS bearer shall be released.

The following network procedures shall apply for handling an error encountered with a mandatory information element
in an ESM message:

   e) If the message is a PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST, a PDN CONNECTIVITY REJECT message with ESM
      cause #96 "invalid mandatory information", shall be returned.

   f) If the message is a PDN DISCONNECT REQUEST, a PDN DISCONNECT REJECT message with ESM cause
      #96 "invalid mandatory information", shall be returned.

   g) If the message is a BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST, a BEARER RESOURCE
      ALLOCATION REJECT message with ESM cause #96 "invalid mandatory information", shall be returned.

   h) If the message is a BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST, a BEARER RESOURCE
      MODIFICATION REJECT message with ESM cause #96 "invalid mandatory information", shall be returned.


7.6           Unknown and unforeseen IEs in the non-imperative
              message part
7.6.1         IEIs unknown in the message
The UE shall ignore all IEs unknown in a message which are not encoded as "comprehension required" (see
3GPP TS 24.007 [12]).

The network shall take the same approach.


7.6.2         Out of sequence IEs
The UE shall ignore all out of sequence IEs in a message which are not encoded as "comprehension required" (see
3GPP TS 24.007 [12]).

The network should take the same approach.


7.6.3         Repeated IEs
If an information element with format T, TV, TLV, or TLV-E is repeated in a message in which repetition of the
information element is not specified in clause 8 of the present document, the UE shall handle only the contents of the
information element appearing first and shall ignore all subsequent repetitions of the information element. When
repetition of information elements is specified, the UE shall handle only the contents of specified repeated information
elements. If the limit on repetition of information elements is exceeded, the UE shall handle the contents of information
elements appearing first up to the limit of repetitions and shall ignore all subsequent repetitions of the information
element.

The network should follow the same procedures.


7.7           Non-imperative message part errors
This category includes:

   -   syntactically incorrect optional IEs; and

   -   conditional IE errors.


7.7.1         Syntactically incorrect optional IEs
The UE shall treat all optional IEs that are syntactically incorrect in a message as not present in the message.

The network shall take the same approach.

7.7.2          Conditional IE errors
When upon receipt of a EMM or ESM message the UE diagnoses a "missing conditional IE" error or an "unexpected
conditional IE" error, or when it receives a EMM or ESM message containing at least one syntactically incorrect
conditional IE, the UE shall ignore the message and shall return a status message (EMM STATUS or ESM STATUS
depending on the PD) with cause #100 "conditional IE error".

When the network receives a message and diagnoses a "missing conditional IE" error or an "unexpected conditional IE"
error or when it receives a message containing at least one syntactically incorrect conditional IE, the network shall
either:

    -   try to treat the message (the exact further actions are implementation dependent); or

    -   ignore the message except that it should return a status message (EMM STATUS or ESM STATUS depending
        on the PD) with cause #100 "conditional IE error".


7.8            Messages with semantically incorrect contents
When a message with semantically incorrect contents is received, the UE shall perform the foreseen reactions of the
procedural part of the present document (i.e. of clauses 4, 5 and 6). If however no such reactions are specified, the UE
shall ignore the message except that it shall return a status message (EMM STATUS or ESM STATUS depending on
the PD) with cause #95 "semantically incorrect message".

The network should follow the same procedure except that a status message is not normally transmitted.



8              Message functional definitions and contents

8.1            Overview
This clause defines the structure of the messages of the Layer 3 (L3) protocols defined in the present document. These
are standard L3 messages as defined in 3GPP TS 24.007 [12].

Each definition given in the present clause includes:

    a) a brief description of the message direction and use, including whether the message has:

        1. Local significance, i.e. relevant only on the originating or terminating access;

        2. Access significance, i.e. relevant in the originating and terminating access, but not in the network;

        3. Dual significance, i.e. relevant in either the originating or terminating access and in the network; or

        4. Global significance, i.e. relevant in the originating and terminating access and in the network.

    b) a table listing the Information Elements (IE) known in the message and the order of their appearance in the
       message. All IEs that may be repeated are explicitly indicated (The V, LV and LV-E formatted IEs, which
       compose the imperative part of the message, occur before the T, TV, TLV and TLV-E formatted IEs which
       compose the non-imperative part of the message, see 3GPP TS 24.007 [12]). In a (maximal) sequence of
       consecutive IEs with half octet length, the first IE with half octet length occupies bits 1 to 4 of octet N, the
       second IE bits 5 to 8 of octet N, the third IE bits 1 to 4 of octet N+1 etc. Such a sequence always has an even
       number of elements.

        For each information element the table indicates:

        1. The Information Element Identifier (IEI), in hexadecimal notation, if the IE has format T, TV, TLV or
           TLV-E. If the IEI has half octet length, it is specified by a notation representing the IEI as a hexadecimal
           digit followed by a "-" (example: B-).

    NOTE:      The same IEI can be used for different information element types in different messages of the same
               protocol.

       2. The name of the information element (which may give an idea of the semantics of the element). The name of
          the information element followed by "IE" or "information element" is used in this technical report as
          reference to the information element within a message.

       3. The name of the type of the information element (which indicates the coding of the value part of the IE), and
          generally, the referenced subclause of clause 9 of the present document describing the value part of the
          information element.

       4. The presence requirement indication (M, C, or O) for the IE as defined in 3GPP TS 24.007 [12].

       5. The format of the information element (T, V, TV, LV, TLV, LV-E or TLV-E) as defined in
          3GPP TS 24.007 [12].

       6. The length of the information element (or permissible range of lengths), in octets, in the message, where "?"
          means that the maximum length of the IE is only constrained by link layer protocol. This indication is non-
          normative.

   c) subclauses specifying, where appropriate, conditions for IEs with presence requirement C or O in the relevant
      message which together with other conditions specified in the present document define when the information
      elements shall be included or not, what non-presence of such IEs means, and – for IEs with presence requirement
      C – the static conditions for presence or non-presence of the IEs or for both cases (see 3GPP TS 24.007 [12]).

                  coding

9.1               Overview
Within the protocols defined in the present document, every message, except the SERVICE REQUEST message, is a
standard L3 message as defined in 3GPP TS 24.007 [12]. This means that the message consists of the following parts:



                                                             ETSI
3GPP TS 24.301 version 15.8.0 Release 15                    371                        ETSI TS 124 301 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


   1) if the message is a plain NAS message:

       a) protocol discriminator;

       b) EPS bearer identity or security header type;

       c) procedure transaction identity;

       d) message type;

       e) other information elements, as required.

   2) if the message is a security protected NAS message:

       a) protocol discriminator;

       b) security header type;

       c) message authentication code;

       d) sequence number;

       e) plain NAS message, as defined in item 1.

The organization of a plain NAS message is illustrated in the example shown in figure 9.1.1.

      Figure 9.1.2: General message organization example for a security protected NAS message

The EPS bearer identity and the procedure transaction identity are only used in messages with protocol discriminator
EPS session management. Octet 1a with the procedure transaction identity shall only be included in these messages.

Unless specified otherwise in the message descriptions of clause 8, a particular information element shall not be present
more than once in a given message.

When a field extends over more than one octet, the order of bit values progressively decreases as the octet number
increases. The most significant bit of the field is represented by the highest numbered bit of the lowest numbered octet
of the field. The least significant bit of the field is represented by the lowest numbered bit of the highest numbered octet
of the field.

9.2           Protocol discriminator
The Protocol Discriminator (PD) and its use are defined in 3GPP TS 24.007 [12]. The protocol discriminator in the
header (see 3GPP TS 24.007 [12]) of a security protected NAS message is encoded as "EPS mobility management
messages".


9.3           Security header type and EPS bearer identity
9.3.1         Security header type
Bits 5 to 8 of the first octet of every EPS Mobility Management (EMM) message contain the Security header type IE.
This IE includes control information related to the security protection of a NAS message. The total size of the Security
header type IE is 4 bits.

The Security header type IE can take the values shown in table 9.3.1.

                 1   1        0   1 These values are not used in this version of the protocol.
                         to         If received they shall be interpreted as '1100'. (NOTE 3)
                 1   1        1   1

                 All other values are reserved.

                 NOTE 1: This codepoint may be used only for a SECURITY MODE COMMAND
                         message.
                 NOTE 2: This codepoint may be used only for a SECURITY MODE COMPLETE
                         message.
                 NOTE 3: When bits 7 and 8 are set to '11', bits 5 and 6 can be used for future
                         extensions of the SERVICE REQUEST message.
                 NOTE 4: This codepoint may be used only for a CONTROL PLANE SERVICE
                         REQUEST message.


An EMM message received with the security header type encoded as 0000 shall be treated as not security protected,
plain NAS message. A protocol entity sending a not security protected EMM message shall send the message as plain
NAS message and encode the security header type as 0000.


9.3.2         EPS bearer identity
Bits 5 to 8 of the first octet of every EPS Session Management (ESM) message contain the EPS bearer identity. The
EPS bearer identity and its use to identify a message flow are defined in 3GPP TS 24.007 [12].

If the UE or the MME or both do not support signalling for a maximum number of 15 EPS bearer contexts, the MME
shall select the EPS bearer identity from the value range 5 to 15, or select the value 0 when it needs to indicate that no
EPS bearer identity is assigned.




                                                               ETSI

   NOTE:      When assigning EPS bearer identities from the range 1 to 4, the MME can take into account that these
              EPS bearer contexts will be subject to local deactivation if the UE performs inter-system change to A/Gb
              mode or Iu mode or if it performs a change to an MME not supporting signalling for a maximum number
              of 15 EPS bearer contexts.


9.4           Procedure transaction identity
Bits 1 to 8 of the second octet (octet 1a) of every EPS Session Management (ESM) message contain the procedure
transaction identity. The procedure transaction identity and its use are defined in 3GPP TS 24.007 [12].


9.5           Message authentication code
The Message authentication code (MAC) information element contains the integrity protection information for the
message. The MAC IE shall be included in the security protected NAS message if a valid EPS security context exists
and security functions are started. The usage of MAC is specified in subclause 4.4.3.3.


9.6           Sequence number
This IE includes the NAS message sequence number (SN) which consists of the eight least significant bits of the NAS
COUNT for a security protected NAS message The usage of SN is specified in subclause 4.4.3.


9.7           NAS message
This IE includes a complete plain NAS message as specified in subclause 8.2 and 8.3. The SECURITY PROTECTED
NAS MESSAGE and the SERVICE REQUEST message are not plain NAS messages and shall not be included in this
IE.


9.8           Message type
The message type IE and its use are defined in 3GPP TS 24.007 [12]. Tables 9.8.1 and 9.8.2 define the value part of the
message type IE used in the EPS mobility management protocol and EPS session management protocol.

9.9           Other information elements
9.9.1         General
The different formats (V, LV, T, TV, TLV, LV-E, TLV-E) and the five categories of information elements (type 1, 2, 3,
4 and 6) are defined in 3GPP TS 24.007 [12].

The first octet of an information element in the non-imperative part contains the IEI of the information element. If this
octet does not correspond to an IEI known in the message, the receiver shall determine whether this IE is of type 1 or 2
(i.e. it is an information element of one octet length) or an IE of type 4 (i.e. that the next octet is the length indicator
indicating the length of the remaining of the information element) (see 3GPP TS 24.007 [12]).

This allows the receiver to jump over unknown information elements and to analyse any following information
elements.




                                                            ETSI

The definitions of information elements which are common for the EMM and ESM protocols or which are used by
access stratum protocols are described in subclause 9.9.2.

The information elements of the EMM or ESM protocols can be defined by reference to an appropriate specification,
e.g., "see subclause 10.5.6.3 in 3GPP TS 24.008 [13]".


9.9.2         Common information elements

9.9.2.0          Additional information
The purpose of the Additional information information element is to provide additional information to upper layers in
relation to the generic NAS message transport mechanism.

The Additional information information element is coded as shown in figure 9.9.2.0.1 and table 9.9.2.0.1.

The Additional information is a type 4 information element with a minimum length of 3 octets.

                   Identity digits (octet 4 etc)

                   For the IMSI, this field is coded using BCD coding. If the number of identity digits is
                   even then bits 5 to 8 of the last octet shall be filled with an end mark coded as
                   "1111".

                   For the GUTI, then bits 5 to 8 of octet 3 are coded as "1111", octet 4 through 6
                   contain the MCC and MNC values as specified below, and bit 8 of octet 7 is the
                   most significant bit and bit 1 of the last octet the least significant bit for the
                   subsequent fields. The required fields for the GUTI are as defined in
                   3GPP TS 23.003 [2].

                   MCC, Mobile country code (octet 4, octet 5 bits 1 to 4)

                   The MCC field is coded as in ITU-T Recommendation E.212 [30], annex A.

                   MNC, Mobile network code (octet 5 bits 5 to 8, octet 6)

                   The coding of this field is the responsibility of each administration but BCD coding
                   shall be used. The MNC shall consist of 2 or 3 digits. If a network operator decides
                   to use only two digits in the MNC, bits 5 to 8 of octet 5 shall be coded as "1111".

                   The contents of the MCC and MNC digits are coded as octets 6 to 8 of the
                   Temporary Mobile Group Identity IE in figure 10.5.154 of 3GPP TS 24.008 [13].

                   For the IMEI, this field is coded using BCD coding. The format of the IMEI is
                   described in 3GPP TS 23.003 [2].




9.9.3.12A         EPS network feature support
The purpose of the EPS network feature support information element is to indicate whether certain features are
supported by the network.

The EPS network feature support information element is coded as shown in figure 9.9.3.12A.1 and table 9.9.3.12A.1.

The EPS network feature support is a type 4 information element with a minimum length of 3 octets and a maximum
length of 4 octets.

If the network does not include octet 4 as defined below in the present version of the protocol, then the UE shall
interpret this as a receipt of an information element with all bits of octet 4 coded as zero.

                   MCC, Mobile country code (octet 2 and 3)
                   The MCC field is coded as in ITU-T Rec. E212 [30], annex A.

                   If the TAI is deleted the MCC and MNC shall take the value from the deleted TAI.

                   In abnormal cases, the MCC stored in the UE can contain elements not in the set
                   {0, 1 ... 9}. In such cases the UE should transmit the stored values using full
                   hexadecimal encoding. When receiving such an MCC, the network shall treat the
                   TAI as deleted.

                   MNC, Mobile network code (octet 3 bits 5 to 8, octet 4)
                   The coding of this field is the responsibility of each administration, but BCD coding
                   shall be used. The MNC shall consist of 2 or 3 digits. For PCS 1900 for NA, Federal
                   regulation mandates that a 3-digit MNC shall be used. However a network operator
                   may decide to use only two digits in the MNC in the TAI over the radio interface. In
                   this case, bits 5 to 8 of octet 3 shall be coded as "1111". Mobile equipment shall
                   accept a TAI coded in such a way.

                   In abnormal cases, the MNC stored in the UE can have:
                   - digit 1 or 2 not in the set {0, 1 ... 9}, or
                   - digit 3 not in the set {0, 1 ... 9, F} hex.
                   In such cases the UE shall transmit the stored values using full hexadecimal
                   encoding. When receiving such an MNC, the network shall treat the TAI as deleted.

                   The same handling shall apply for the network, if a 3-digit MNC is sent by the UE to
                   a network using only a 2-digit MNC.

                   TAC, Tracking area code (octet 5 and 6)
                   In the TAC field bit 8 of octet 5 is the most significant bit and bit 1 of octet 6 the
                   least significant bit.
                   The coding of the tracking area code is the responsibility of each administration
                   except that two values are used to mark the TAC, and hence the TAI, as deleted.
                   Coding using full hexadecimal representation may be used. The tracking area code
                   consists of 2 octets.
                   If a TAI has to be deleted then all bits of the tracking area code shall be set to one
                   with the exception of the least significant bit which shall be set to zero. If a USIM is
                   inserted in a mobile equipment with the tracking area code containing all zeros,
                   then the mobile equipment shall recognise this TAC as part of a deleted TAI.




9.9.3.33          Tracking area identity list
The purpose of the Tracking area identity list information element is to transfer a list of tracking areas from the network
to the UE.

The coding of the information element allows combining different types of lists. The lists of type "00" and "01" allow a
more compact encoding, when the different TAIs are sharing the PLMN identity.

The Tracking area identity list information element is coded as shown in figure 9.9.3.33.1, figure 9.9.3.33.2,
figure 9.9.3.33.3, figure 9.9.3.33.4 and table 9.9.3.33.1.

The Tracking area identity list is a type 4 information element, with a minimum length of 8 octets and a maximum
length of 98 octets. The list can contain a maximum of 16 different tracking area identities.

                In the TAC field bit 8 of the first octet is the most significant bit and bit 1 of second octet
                the least significant bit.
                The coding of the tracking area code is the responsibility of each administration.
                Coding using full hexadecimal representation may be used. The tracking area code
                consists of 2 octets.

                NOTE:      If the "list of TAIs belonging to different PLMNs" is used, the PLMNs
                           included in the list need to be present in the list of "equivalent PLMNs".



9.9.3.34          UE network capability
The purpose of the UE network capability information element is to provide the network with information concerning
aspects of the UE related to EPS or interworking with GPRS. The contents might affect the manner in which the
network handles the operation of the UE. The UE network capability information indicates general UE characteristics
and it shall therefore, except for fields explicitly indicated, be independent of the frequency band of the channel it is
sent on.

The UE network capability information element is coded as shown in figure 9.9.3.34.1 and table 9.9.3.34.1.

The UE network capability is a type 4 information element with a minimum length of 4 octets and a maximum length of
15 octets.

   NOTE:      The requirements for the support of UMTS security algorithms in the UE are specified in
              3GPP TS 33.102 [18], and the requirements for the support of EPS security algorithms in
              3GPP TS 33.401 [19].

9.9.3.35          UE radio capability information update needed
The purpose of the UE radio capability information update needed information element is to indicate whether the MME
shall delete the stored UE radio capability information, if any.

The UE radio capability information update needed information element is coded as shown in figure 9.9.3.35.1and
table 9.9.3.35.1.

The UE radio capability information update needed is a type 1 information element.

9.9.3.36          UE security capability
The UE security capability information element is used by the network to indicate which security algorithms are
supported by the UE in S1 mode, Iu mode and Gb mode. Security algorithms supported in S1 mode are supported both
for NAS and for AS security. If the UE supports S101 mode, then these security algorithms are also supported for NAS
security in S101 mode.

The UE security capability information element is coded as shown in figure 9.9.3.36.1 and table 9.9.3.36.1.

The UE security capability is a type 4 information element with a minimum length of 4 octets and a maximum length of
7 octets.

Octets 5, 6, and 7 are optional. If octet 5 is included, then also octet 6 shall be included and octet 7 may be included.

If a UE did not indicate support of any security algorithm for Gb mode, octet 7 shall not be included. If the UE did not
indicate support of any security algorithm for Iu mode and Gb mode, octets 5, 6, and 7 shall not be included.

If the UE did not indicate support of any security algorithm for Iu mode but indicated support of a security algorithm for
Gb mode, octets 5, 6, and 7 shall be included. In this case octets 5 and 6 are filled with the value of zeroes.

9.9.3.37         Emergency Number List
See subclause 10.5.3.13 in 3GPP TS 24.008 [13].

9.9.3.37A        Extended emergency number list
The purpose of this information element is to encode one or more local emergency number(s) together with a sub-
services field containing zero ore more sub-services of the associated emergency service URN and a validity indication.
An emergency service URN is a service URN with top level service type of "sos" as specified in IETF RFC 5031 [55].

   EXAMPLE 1:        If the associated emergency service URN is "urn:service:sos.gas", there is only one sub-service
                     provided in the sub-services field which is "gas".

   EXAMPLE 2:        If the associated emergency service URN is "urn:service:sos", there is no sub-services provided in
                     the sub-services field and the length of the sub-services field is "0".

   NOTE:      The associated emergency service URN can be a country-specific emergency service URN as defined in
              3GPP TS 24.229 [13D].

The Extended emergency number list information element is coded as shown in figure 9.9.3.37A.1 and
table 9.9.3.37A.1.

The Extended emergency number list IE is a type 6 information element with a minimum length of 6 octets and a
maximum length of 65538 octets.

9.9.4.2             APN aggregate maximum bit rate
The purpose of the APN aggregate maximum bit rate information element is to indicate the initial subscribed APN-
AMBR when the UE establishes a PDN connection or to indicate the new APN-AMBR if it is changed by the network.

The APN aggregate maximum bit rate information element is coded as shown in figure 9.9.4.2.1 and table 9.9.4.2.1.

The APN aggregate maximum bit rate is a type 4 information element with a minimum length of 4 octets and a
maximum length of 8 octets. Octets 5-8 are optional. If octet 5 is included, then octet 6 shall also be included, and octets
7-8 may be included. If octet 7 is included, then octet 8 shall also be included. The length of the APN-AMBR IE can be
either 4 octets, 6 octets or 8 octets.

9.9.4.3           EPS quality of service
The purpose of the EPS quality of service information element is to specify the QoS parameters for an EPS bearer
context.

The EPS quality of service information element is coded as shown in figure 9.9.4.3.1 and table 9.9.4.3.1.

The EPS quality of service is a type 4 information element with a minimum length of 3 octets and a maximum length of
15 octets. Octets 4-15 are optional. If octet 4 is included, then octets 5-7 shall also be included, and octets 8-15 may be
included. If octet 8 is included, then octets 4-11 shall also be included, and octets 12-15 may be included. If octet 12 is
included, then octets 4-15 shall also be included. The length of the EPS QoS IE can be either 3 octets, 7 octets, 11 octets
or 15 octets.

Refer to 3GPP TS 23.203 [7] for a detailed description of the QoS Class Identifier (QCI).

9.9.4.15          Traffic flow aggregate description
The purpose of the Traffic flow aggregate description information element is to specify the aggregate of one of more
packet filters and their related parameters and operations. The traffic flow aggregate description may contain the
aggregate of packet filters for the downlink direction, the uplink direction or packet filters that apply for both directions.
The packet filters determine the traffic mapping to EPS bearer contexts. The downlink packet filters shall be applied by
the network, and the uplink packet filters shall be applied by the UE. A packet filter that applies for both directions shall
be applied by the network as a downlink packet filter and by the UE as an uplink packet filter.

When the traffic flow aggregate description is used in the UE requested bearer resource allocation procedure or the UE
requested bearer resource modification procedure, it is associated to a particular procedure identified by a procedure
transaction identity (PTI). Therefore, the UE shall release the traffic flow aggregate description when the UE requested
bearer resource allocation procedure or the UE requested bearer resource modification procedure is completed. The UE
shall not include the packet filters of a particular traffic flow aggregate description in any other traffic flow aggregate
description when multiple UE requested bearer resource allocation procedures and/or UE requested bearer resource
modification procedures are ongoing in parallel.

The Traffic flow aggregate description information element is encoded using the same format as the Traffic flow
template (TFT) information element (see subclause 10.5.6.12 in 3GPP TS 24.008 [13]). When sending this IE in the
BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST message or the BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION
REQUEST message, the UE shall set the packet filter identifier values to 0 if the packet filters are newly created;
otherwise, the UE shall set the packet filter identifier values from those of already assigned packet filter identifiers of
the existing EPS bearer, so that they are unique across all packet filters for the EPS bearer context indicated by the EPS
bearer identity IE.

NOTE 1: The cases in which the default value of this timer is used are described in subclause 5.3.6.
NOTE 2: The value of this timer is provided by the network operator during the attach and tracking area updating
         procedures.
NOTE 3: The value of this timer may be provided by the network in the ATTACH ACCEPT message and TRACKING
         AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message. The default value of this timer is identical to the value of T3412.
NOTE 4: The value of this timer is provided by the network operator when a service request for CS fallback is rejected
         by the network with EMM cause #39 "CS service temporarily not available".
NOTE 5: The default value of this timer is used if the network does not indicate a value in the TRACKING AREA
         UPDATE ACCEPT message and the UE does not have a stored value for this timer.
NOTE 6: The conditions for which this applies are described in subclause 5.5.3.2.6.
NOTE 7: In NB-S1 mode, the timer value shall be calculated as described in subclause 4.7.
NOTE 8: In WB-S1 mode, if the UE supports CE mode B and operates in either CE mode A or CE mode B, then the
         timer value is as described in this table for the case of WB-S1/CE mode (see subclause 4.8).
NOTE 9: It is possible that the UE does not stop or start timer T3440 upon receipt of ESM DATA TRANSPORT
         message as described in subclause 5.3.1.2.1.
NOTE 10: The timer value is provided by the network in the ATTACH ACCEPT, TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT,
         SERVICE ACCEPT or SERVICE REJECT message, or chosen randomly from a default value range of 15 –
         30 minutes.
NOTE 11: If the timer is started due to a UE configured for eCall only mode moving from GERAN/UTRAN to E-UTRAN
         with timer T3242 (see 3GPP TS 24.008 [13]) running, the UE starts the timer with a value set to the time left
         on timer T3242. Otherwise the UE starts the timer with a value set to 12 hours.
NOTE 12: If the timer is started due to a UE configured for eCall only mode moving from GERAN/UTRAN to E-UTRAN
         with timer T3243 (see 3GPP TS 24.008 [13]) running, the UE starts the timer with a value set to the time left
         on timer T3243. Otherwise the UE starts the timer with a value set to 12 hours.

NOTE 1: Typically, the procedures are aborted on the fifth expiry of the relevant timer. Exceptions are described in the
         corresponding procedure description.
NOTE 2: The value of this timer is network dependent.
NOTE 3: The value of this timer is network dependent. If ISR is activated, the default value of this timer is 4 minutes
         greater than T3423.
NOTE 4: The default value of this timer is 4 minutes greater than T3412. If T3346 is larger than T3412 and the MME
         includes timer T3346 in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REJECT message or SERVICE REJECT message,
         the value of the mobile reachable timer and implicit detach timer is set such that the sum of the timer values
         is greater than T3346. If the UE is attached for emergency bearer services, the value of this timer is set equal
         to T3412.
NOTE 5: If the MME includes timer T3324 in the ATTACH ACCEPT message or TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT
         message and if the UE is not attached for emergency bearer services and has no PDN connection for
         emergency bearer services, the value of this timer is equal to the value of timer T3324.
NOTE 6: The value of this timer is smaller than the value of timer T3-RESPONSE (see 3GPP TS 29.274 [16D]).
NOTE 7: In NB-S1 mode, then the timer value shall be calculated as described in subclause 4.7.
NOTE 8: In NB-S1 mode, then the timer value shall be calculated by using an NAS timer value which is network
         dependent.
NOTE 9: In WB-S1 mode, if the UE supports CE mode B and operates in either CE mode A or CE mode B, then the
         timer value is as described in this table for the case of WB-S1/CE mode (see subclause 4.8).
NOTE 10: In WB-S1 mode, if the UE supports CE mode B, then the timer value shall be calculated by using an NAS
         timer value which value is network dependent.

NOTE 1: Typically, the procedures are aborted on the fifth expiry of the relevant timer. Exceptions are described in the
          corresponding procedure description.
NOTE 2: In NB-S1 mode, then the timer value shall be calculated as described in subclause 4.7.
NOTE 3: In WB-S1 mode, if the UE supports CE mode B and operates in either CE mode A or CE mode B, then the
          timer value is as described in this table for the case of WB-S1/CE mode (see subclause 4.8).


   NOTE 1: The back-off timer is used to describe a logical model of the required UE behaviour. This model does not
           imply any specific implementation, e.g. as a timer or timestamp.

   NOTE 2: Reference to back-off timer in this section can either refer to use of timer T3396 or to use of a different
           packet system specific timer within the UE. Whether the UE uses T3396 as a back-off timer or it uses
           different packet system specific timers as back-off timers is left up to UE implementation.

Annex A (informative):
Cause values for EPS mobility management

A.1          Causes related to UE identification
Cause #2 – IMSI unknown in HSS

      This EMM cause is sent to the UE if the UE is not known (registered) in the HSS or if the UE has packet only
      subscription. This EMM cause does not affect operation of the EPS service, although is may be used by an EMM
      procedure.

Cause #3 – Illegal UE

      This EMM cause is sent to the UE when the network refuses service to the UE either because an identity of the
      UE is not acceptable to the network or because the UE does not pass the authentication check, i.e. the RES
      received from the UE is different from that generated by the network.

Cause #6 – Illegal ME

      This EMM cause is sent to the UE if the ME used is not acceptable to the network, e.g. blacklisted.

Cause #9 – UE identity cannot be derived by the network.

      This EMM cause is sent to the UE when the network cannot derive the UE's identity from the GUTI/S-TMSI/P-
      TMSI and RAI e.g. no matching identity/context in the network or failure to validate the UE's identity due to
      integrity check failure of the received message.

Cause #10 – Implicitly detached

      This EMM cause is sent to the UE either if the network has implicitly detached the UE, e.g. after the implicit
      detach timer has expired, or if the EMM context data related to the subscription does not exist in the MME e.g.
      because of a MME restart, or because of a periodic tracking area update request routed to a new MME.



A.2          Cause related to subscription options
Cause #5 – IMEI not accepted

      This cause is sent to the UE if the network does not accept an attach procedure for emergency bearer services
      using an IMEI.

Cause #7 – EPS services not allowed

      This EMM cause is sent to the UE when it is not allowed to operate EPS services.

Cause #8 – EPS services and non-EPS services not allowed

      This EMM cause is sent to the UE when it is not allowed to operate either EPS or non-EPS services.

Cause #11 – PLMN not allowed

      This EMM cause is sent to the UE if it requests service, or if the network initiates a detach request, in a PLMN
      where the UE, by subscription or due to operator determined barring, is not allowed to operate.

Cause #12 – Tracking area not allowed

      This EMM cause is sent to the UE if it requests service, or if the network initiates a detach request, in a tracking
      area where the HPLMN determines that the UE, by subscription, is not allowed to operate.

   NOTE 1: If EMM cause #12 is sent to a roaming subscriber the subscriber is denied service even if other PLMNs
           are available on which registration was possible.

Cause #13 – Roaming not allowed in this tracking area

       This EMM cause is sent to an UE which requests service, or if the network initiates a detach request, in a
       tracking area of a PLMN which by subscription offers roaming to that UE but not in that tracking area.

Cause #14 – EPS services not allowed in this PLMN

       This EMM cause is sent to the UE which requests service, or if the network initiates a detach request, in a PLMN
       which does not offer roaming for EPS services to that UE.

   NOTE 2: Since only one list of forbidden PLMNs for packet services is maintained in the UE, then the "forbidden
           PLMNs for GPRS service" is the maintained list and the forbidden PLMNs for EPS service is equivalent
           to it.

Cause #15 – No suitable cells in tracking area

       This EMM cause is sent to the UE if it requests service, or if the network initiates a detach request, in a tracking
       area where the UE, by subscription, is not allowed to operate, but when it should find another allowed tracking
       area or location area in the same PLMN or an equivalent PLMN.

   NOTE 3: Cause #15 and cause #12 differ in the fact that cause #12 does not trigger the UE to search for another
           allowed tracking area on the same PLMN.

Cause #25 – Not authorized for this CSG

       This EMM cause is sent to the UE if it requests access, or if the network initiates a detach request, in a CSG cell
       with CSG ID where the UE either has no subscription to operate or the UE's subscription has expired and it
       should find another cell in the same PLMN or an equivalent PLMN.

Cause #35 – Requested service option not authorized in this PLMN

       This EMM cause is sent to the UE if it requests in a PLMN a service option for which it is not authorized, e.g. if
       it attempts to attach for relay node operation in a PLMN with a USIM which does not belong to a relay node-
       specific subscription.

Cause #40 – No EPS bearer context activated

       This EMM cause is sent to the UE, if during a tracking area updating procedure or a service request, the MME
       detects that there is no active EPS bearer context in the network.



A.3           Causes related to PLMN specific network failures
              and congestion/authentication failures
Cause #16 – MSC temporarily not reachable

       This EMM cause is sent to the UE if it requests a combined EPS attach or tracking area updating in a PLMN
       where the MSC is temporarily not reachable via the EPS part of the network.

Cause #17 – Network failure

       This EMM cause is sent to the UE if the MME cannot service an UE generated request because of PLMN
       failures.

Cause #18 – CS domain not available

       This EMM cause is sent to the UE if the MME cannot service an UE generated request because CS domain is not
       available and SMS in MME is not supported.

Cause #19 – ESM failure

       This EMM cause is sent to the UE when there is a failure in the ESM message contained in the EMM message.

Cause #20 – MAC failure

      This EMM cause is sent to the network if the USIM detects that the MAC in the AUTHENTICATION
      REQUEST message is not fresh (see 3GPP TS 33.401 [19]).

Cause #21 – Synch failure

      This EMM cause is sent to the network if the USIM detects that the SQN in the AUTHENTICATION
      REQUEST message is out of range (see 3GPP TS 33.401 [19]).

Cause #22 – Congestion

      This EMM cause is sent to the UE because of congestion in the network (e.g. no channel, facility busy/congested
      etc.).

Cause #23 – UE security capabilities mismatch

      This EMM cause is sent to the network if the UE detects that the UE security capability does not match the one
      sent back by the network.

Cause #24 – Security mode rejected, unspecified

      This EMM cause is sent to the network if the security mode command is rejected by the UE if the UE detects
      that the nonceUE does not match the one sent back by the network or for unspecified reasons.

Cause #26 – Non-EPS authentication unacceptable

      This EMM cause is sent to the network in S1 mode if the "separation bit" in the AMF field of AUTN is set to 0
      in the AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message (see 3GPP TS 33.401 [19]).

Cause #39 – CS service temporarily not available

      This EMM cause is sent to the UE when the CS fallback or 1xCS fallback request cannot be served temporarily
      due to O&M reasons or a mobile terminating CS fallback call is aborted by the network during call
      establishment (see 3GPP TS 29.118 [16A]).

Cause #42 – Severe network failure

      This EMM cause is sent to the UE when the network has determined that the requested procedure cannot be
      completed successfully due to network failure. The failure is not expected to be temporary and repeated request
      is not likely to succeed in near future.

Annex C (normative):
Storage of EMM information
The following EMM parameters shall be stored on the USIM if the corresponding file is present:

   -   GUTI;

   -   last visited registered TAI;

   -   EPS update status;

   -   Allowed CSG list;

   -   Operator CSG list; and

   -   EPS security context parameters from a full native EPS security context (see 3GPP TS 33.401 [19]).

   The presence and format of corresponding files on the USIM is specified in 3GPP TS 31.102 [17].

If the corresponding file is not present on the USIM, these EMM parameters except allowed CSG list are stored in a
non-volatile memory in the ME together with the IMSI from the USIM. The allowed CSG list is stored in a non-volatile
memory in the ME if the UE supports CSG selection. These EMM parameters can only be used if the IMSI from the
USIM matches the IMSI stored in the non-volatile memory; else the UE shall delete the EMM parameters.

The following EMM parameters shall be stored in a non-volatile memory in the ME together with the IMSI from the
USIM:

   -   TIN; and

   -   DCN-ID list.

The TIN parameter can only be used if the IMSI from the USIM matches the IMSI stored in the non-volatile memory of
the ME; else the UE shall delete the TIN parameter.

The DCN-ID list consists of DCN-IDs stored together with a PLMN identity. The list can have zero or more entries and
the maximum length shall be at least 32 entries. When the maximum length is reached any new entry shall replace the
oldest entry in the list. There shall be no duplicated PLMN identities in the list and any existing DCN-ID shall be
deleted when a new DCN-ID is added for the same PLMN.

The DCN-ID list can only be used if the IMSI from the USIM matches the IMSI stored in the non-volatile memory of
the ME; else the UE shall delete the DCN-ID list. The UE shall delete the stored DCN-ID list if the default standardized
DCN-ID in the UE is changed.

If the UE is attached for emergency bearer services, the UE shall not store the EMM parameters described in this annex
on the USIM or in non-volatile memory. Instead the UE shall temporarily store these parameters locally in the ME and
the UE shall delete these parameters when the UE is detached.

If the UE is configured for eCall only mode as specified in 3GPP TS 31.102 [17], the UE shall not store the EMM
parameters described in this annex on the USIM or in non-volatile memory. Instead the UE shall temporarily store these
parameters locally in the ME and the UE shall delete these parameters when the UE enters EMM-
DEREGISTERED.eCALL-INACTIVE state, the UE is switched-off or the USIM is removed.

When EMM requests the establishment of a NAS-signalling connection, or when EMM requests the lower layers to
resume a NAS signalling connection, the RRC establishment cause used by the UE shall be selected according to the
NAS procedure as specified in table D.1.1. The EMM shall also indicate to the lower layer for the purpose of access
control, the call type associated with the RRC establishment cause as specified in table D.1.1. If the UE is configured
for EAB (see the "ExtendedAccessBarring" leaf of NAS configuration MO in 3GPP TS 24.368 [15A] or
3GPP TS 31.102 [17]), the EMM shall indicate to the lower layer for the purpose of access control that EAB applies for
this request except for the following cases:

   -   the UE is a UE configured to use AC11 – 15 in selected PLMN;

   -   the UE is answering to paging;

   -   the RRC Establishment cause is set to "Emergency call";

   -   the UE is configured to allow overriding EAB (see the "Override_ExtendedAccessBarring" leaf of the NAS
       configuration MO as specified in 3GPP TS 24.368 [15A] or 3GPP TS 31.102 [17]) and receives an indication

Annex E (informative):
Guidelines for enhancements to MS network capability IE
and UE network capability IE
The UE uses the information elements MS network capability and UE network capability to inform the core network
about its network related capabilities. Both information elements can be signalled in any of the modes: A/Gb mode, Iu
mode and S1 mode.

The purpose of the present annex is to give some guidelines how to select the information element(s) to be enhanced if
new capabilities need to be added.

   1) If a capability is related to a feature that can be used in a network supporting A/Gb mode only or Iu mode only or
      both, the capability will be signalled in the MS network capability IE.

   2) If a capability is related to a feature that can be used in network supporting S1 mode only, the capability will be
      signalled in the UE network capability IE.

   3) If a capability is related to a feature that can be used only in a network supporting both S1 mode and at least one
      of the two modes A/Gb mode and Iu mode, the capability is added only to one of the two information elements:

       a) If the information is used by the MME only, the capability will be signalled in the UE network capability IE.

       b) If the information is used by the SGSN only or both by the SGSN and by the MME, the capability will be
          signalled in the MS network capability IE.

   NOTE:      The reason for rules 1 and 2 is that a UE not supporting A/Gb mode and Iu mode will not provide the MS
              network capability IE to the network and a UE not supporting S1 mode will not provide the UE network
              capability IE. In some cases, due to rules 1 and 2 the capability indicator will be included in both
              information elements.

   EXAMPLE 1:        The support indicator for UCS2 is included in both information elements.

   EXAMPLE 2:        The "SRVCC to GERAN/UTRAN capability" is included in the MS network capability IE, as it is
                     used both by the MME for SRVCC from E-UTRAN to GERAN/UTRAN and by the SGSN for
                     SRVCC from UTRAN HSPA to GERAN/UTRAN.

Annex F (normative):
Application specific Congestion control for Data
Communication (ACDC)
The UE may support the procedures in this annex.

If the UE supports ACDC, the EMM layer shall determine the ACDC category applicable to the request based on the
application identifier received from the upper layers and the configuration information in the "ACDCConf" leaf of
ACDC MO as specified in 3GPP TS 24.105 [35] or in the USIM EFACDC as specified in 3GPP TS 31.102 [17].

   NOTE 1: As an implementation option, the upper layers can determine the ACDC category and send it to the EMM
           layer. Then the EMM layer need not read the ACDC MO or USIM to determine the ACDC category.

The EMM sublayer shall indicate to the lower layers, for the purpose of access control:

   -   the ACDC category that applies to this request if only one ACDC category is applicable;

   -   the highest ranked ACDC category among the ACDC categories that applies to this request if multiple ACDC
       categories are applicable; or

   -   this request is for an uncategorized application if an application identifier received from the upper layers is not
       mapped to any ACDC category,

except for the following cases:

   -   the UE is a UE configured to use AC11 – 15 in selected PLMN;

   -   the UE is answering to paging;

   -   the RRC Establishment cause is set to "Emergency call"; or

   -   if conditions MO MMTEL voice call is started or MO MMTEL video call is started or MO SMSoIP is started, is
       satisfied.

   NOTE 2: The request from the EMM sublayer refers to either a request to establish an initial NAS signalling
           connection or a request to re-establish a NAS signalling connection.

If the UE supports ACDC and access is barred because of ACDC, the EMM layer shall keep track of the ACDC
category for which access is barred and it shall not send a request for the same ACDC category or a lower ACDC
category until access is granted.

If the UE supports ACDC and access is barred because of ACDC, the EMM layer shall not send a request for any
uncategorized application until access is granted.
