1             Scope
The present document specifies the procedures used at the radio interface core network protocols within the 3rd
generation mobile telecommunications system and the digital cellular telecommunications system.

It specifies the procedures used at the radio interface (Reference Point Um or Uu, see 3GPP TS 24.002 [15] or
3GPP TS 23.002 [127]) for Call Control (CC), Mobility Management (MM), and Session Management (SM).

When the notations for "further study" or "FS" or "FFS" are present in this TS they mean that the indicated text is not a
normative portion of the present document.

These procedures are defined in terms of messages exchanged over the control channels of the radio interface. The
control channels are described in 3GPP TS 44.003 [16] and 3GPP TS 25.301 [128].

The structured functions and procedures of this protocol and the relationship with other layers and entities are described
in general terms in 3GPP TS 24.007 [20].

The present document specifies functions, procedures and information which apply to GERAN Iu mode. However,
functionality related to GERAN Iu mode is neither maintained nor enhanced.


1.1           Scope of the Technical Specification
The procedures currently described in this TS are for the call control of circuit-switched connections, session
management for GPRS services, mobility management and radio resource management for circuit-switched and GPRS
services.

3GPP TS 24.010 [21] contains functional procedures for support of supplementary services.

3GPP TS 24.011 [22] contains functional procedures for support of point-to-point short message services.

3GPP TS 24.012 [23] contains functional description of short message - cell broadcast.

3GPP TS 44.060 [76] contains procedures for radio link control and medium access control (RLC/MAC) of packet data
physical channels.

3GPP TS 44.071 [23a] contains functional descriptions and procedures for support of location services.

    NOTE:     "layer 3" includes the functions and protocols described in the present document. The terms "data link
              layer" and "layer 2" are used interchangeably to refer to the layer immediately below layer 3.


1.2           Application to the interface structures
The procedures defined in the present document apply to the interface structures defined in 3GPP TS 44.003 [16] and
3GPP TS 25.301 [128]. They use the functions and services provided by lower layers defined in 3GPP TS 44.005 [18]
and 3GPP TS 44.006 [19] or 3GPP TS 25.331 [23c], 3GPP TS 25.322 [19b] and 3GPP TS 25.321 [19a].
3GPP TS 24.007 [20] gives the general description of layer 3 (A/Gb mode) and Non Access Stratum (Iu mode and S1
mode) including procedures, messages format and error handling.


1.3           Structure of layer 3 procedures
A building block method is used to describe the layer 3 procedures.

The basic building blocks are "elementary procedures" provided by the protocol control entities of the three sublayers,
i.e. radio resource management, mobility management and connection management sublayer.

Complete layer 3 transactions consist of specific sequences of elementary procedures. The term "structured procedure"
is used for these sequences.

1.4            Test procedures
Test procedures of the GSM radio interface signalling are described in 3GPP TS 51.010 [39] and
3GPP TS 51.02x series.


1.5            Use of logical channels in A/Gb mode
The logical control channels are defined in 3GPP TS 45.002 [32]. In the following those control channels are
considered which carry signalling information or specific types of user packet information:

   i) Broadcast Control CHannel (BCCH): downlink only, used to broadcast Cell specific information;

   ii) Synchronization CHannel (SCH): downlink only, used to broadcast synchronization and BSS identification
       information;

   iii) Paging CHannel (PCH): downlink only, used to send page requests to Mobile Stations (MSs);

   iv) Random Access CHannel (RACH): uplink only, used to request a Dedicated Control CHannel;

   v) Access Grant CHannel (AGCH): downlink only, used to allocate a Dedicated Control CHannel;

   vi) Standalone Dedicated Control CHannel (SDCCH): bi-directional;

   vii) Fast Associated Control CHannel (FACCH): bi-directional, associated with a Traffic CHannel;

   viii)   Slow Associated Control CHannel (SACCH): bi-directional, associated with a SDCCH or a Traffic CHannel;

   ix) Cell Broadcast CHannel (CBCH): downlink only used for general (not point to point) short message information;

   x) Notification CHannel (NCH): downlink only, used to notify mobile stations of VBS (Voice Broadcast Service)
      calls or VGCS (Voice Group Call Service) calls.

Two service access points are defined on signalling layer 2 which are discriminated by their Service Access Point
Identifiers (SAPI) (see 3GPP TS 44.006 [19]):

   i) SAPI 0: supports the transfer of signalling information including user-user information;

   ii) SAPI 3: supports the transfer of user short messages.

Layer 3 selects the service access point, the logical control channel and the mode of operation of layer 2
(acknowledged, unacknowledged or random access, see 3GPP TS 44.005 [18] and 3GPP TS 44.006 [19]) as required
for each individual message.

given in clause 7. This part of the present document is only provided for guidance to assist implementations.

Clause 8 specifies actions to be taken on various error conditions and also provides rules to ensure compatibility with
future enhancements of the protocol.


1.7            Applicability of implementations
The applicability of procedures of the present document for the mobile station is dependent on the services and
functions which are to be supported by a mobile station.


1.7.1          Voice Group Call Service (VGCS) and Voice Broadcast Service
               (VBS)
Voice Group Call Service and Voice Broadcast Service are applicable in A/Gb mode only.

For mobile stations supporting the Voice Group Call Service or the Voice Broadcast Service, it is explicitly mentioned
throughout the present document if a certain procedure is applicable only for such a service and, if necessary, how
mobile stations not supporting such a service shall behave.

For VGCS and VBS, the following possible mobile station implementations exist:

   -   support of listening to voice broadcast calls (VBS listening);

   -   support of originating a voice broadcast call (VBS originating);

   -   support of listening to voice group calls (VGCS listening);

   -   support of talking in voice group calls (VGCS talking. This always includes the implementation for VGCS
       listening);

   -   support of originating a voice group call (VGCS originating. This always includes the implementation for VGCS
       talking).

Apart from the explicitly mentioned combinations, all possible combinations are optional and supported by the present
document.

The related terms are used in the present document, if information on these implementation options is required.


1.7.2          General Packet Radio Service (GPRS)

1.7.2.1           Packet services in GSM (A/Gb mode only)
For mobile stations supporting the General Packet Radio Service (GPRS), it is explicitly mentioned throughout the
technical specification if a certain procedure is applicable only for such a service and, if necessary, how mobile stations
not supporting such a service shall behave.




                                                           ETSI
3GPP TS 24.008 version 15.8.0 Release 15                   33                       ETSI TS 124 008 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


A GPRS MS may operate in one of the following MS operation modes, see 3GPP TS 23.060 [74]:

   -   MS operation mode A;

   -   MS operation mode B; or

   -   MS operation mode C.

The MS operation mode depends on the services that the MS is attached to, i.e., only GPRS or both GPRS and non-
GPRS services, and upon the MS's capabilities to operate GPRS and other GSM services simultaneously. Mobile
stations that are capable to operate GPRS services are referred to as GPRS MSs.

   NOTE:      Other GSM technical specifications may refer to the MS operation modes A, B, and C as GPRS class-A
              MS, GPRS class-B MS, and GPRS class-C MS.

It should be noted that it is possible that for a GPRS MS, the GMM procedures currently described in the ETS do not
support combinations of VGCS, VBS and GPRS. The possible interactions are not studied yet.

1.7.2.2          Packet services in Iu mode (Iu mode only)
An MS attached to packet switched domain may operate in one of the following MS operation modes, see
3GPP TS 23.060 [74]:

   -   CS/PS mode of operation; or

   -   PS mode of operation.

The terms 'CS/PS mode of operation' and 'PS mode of operation' are not used in the present document with some
exceptions. Instead the terms 'MS operation mode A' and 'MS operation mode C' are used.

In network operation mode I and II (see 3GPP TS 23.060 [74]), an MS in CS/PS mode of operation shall use the same
procedures as for a GPRS MS operating in MS operation mode A, unless it is explicitly stated for A/Gb mode only or
Iu mode only.

In network operation mode I and II, an MS in PS mode of operation shall use the same procedures as for a GPRS MS
operating in MS operation mode C, unless it is explicitly stated for A/Gb mode only or Iu mode only.


1.8           Handling of NAS signalling low priority indication
An MS configured for NAS signalling low priority (see 3GPP TS 24.368 [135], 3GPP TS 31.102 [112]) indicates this
by including the Device properties IE in the appropriate NAS message and setting the low priority indicator to "MS is
configured to NAS signalling low priority" except for the following cases in which the MS shall set the low priority
indicator to "MS is not configured for NAS signalling low priority":

   -   the MS is performing an attach for emergency bearer services;

   -   the MS has a PDN connection for emergency bearer services established and is performing mobility
       management procedures, or is establishing a PDN connection for emergency bearer services;

   -   the MS configured for dual priority is requested by the upper layers to establish a PDN connection with the low
       priority indicator set to "MS is not configured for NAS signalling low priority";

   -   the MS configured for dual priority is performing session management procedures related to the PDN connection
       established with low priority indicator set to "MS is not configured for NAS signalling low priority";

   -   the MS configured for dual priority has a PDN connection established by setting the low priority indicator to
       "MS is not configured for NAS signalling low priority" and is performing mobility management procedures;

   -   the MS is establishing or re-establishing an MM connection for an emergency call;

   -   the MS is an MS configured to use AC11 – 15 in selected PLMN; or

   -   the MS is responding to paging.




                                                         ETSI
3GPP TS 24.008 version 15.8.0 Release 15                       34                        ETSI TS 124 008 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


The network may use the NAS signalling low priority indication for NAS level mobility management congestion
control on a per core network node basis and APN based congestion control.

If the NAS signalling low priority indication is provided in an ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message, the
SGSN stores the NAS signalling low priority indication within the default PDP context activated due to this request.


1.9              Restrictions
Independently of what is stated elsewhere in this and other 3GPP specifications, mobile station support for PBCCH and
PCCCH is optional for A/Gb-mode of operation. The network shall never enable PBCCH and PCCCH. This makes use
of network operation mode III obsolete.

2.1.1         Random values
In a number of places in the present document, it is mentioned that some value must take a "random" value, in a given
range, or more generally with some statistical distribution. Such cases interest only the Mobile Station.

It is required that there is a low probability that two MSs in the same conditions (including the case of two MSs of the
same type from the same manufacturer) will choose the same value. Moreover, it is required that, if it happens that two
MSs in similar conditions choose the same value, the probability of their choices being identical at the next occasion is
the same as if their first choices had been different.

The meaning of such a specification is that any statistical test for these values, done on a series of similar events, will
obtain a result statistically compatible with the specified distribution. This shall hold even in the cases where the tests
are conducted with a subset of possible events, with some common parameters. Moreover, basic tests of independence
of the values within the series shall pass.

Data against which correlation with the values shall not be found are the protocol state, or the IMSI, or identities or
other unrelated information broadcast by the network, or the current TDMA frame number.


2.1.2         Vocabulary
For the purposes of the present document, the following terms and definitions apply:

   -   A GSM security context is established and stored in the MS and the network as a result of a successful
       execution of a GSM authentication challenge. The GSM security context for the CS domain consists of the GSM
       ciphering key and the ciphering key sequence number. The GSM security context for the PS domain consists of
       the GPRS GSM ciphering key and the GPRS ciphering key sequence number.

   -   A UMTS security context is established and stored in the MS and the network as a result of a successful
       execution of a UMTS authentication challenge. The UMTS security context for the CS domain consists of the

       the GSM Kc128 (if an A5 ciphering algorithm that requires a 128-bit ciphering key is in use). The UMTS security
       context for the PS domain consists of the GPRS UMTS ciphering key, the GPRS UMTS integrity key, the GPRS
       GSM ciphering key, the GPRS ciphering key sequence number, the GPRS GSM Kc128 (if a GEA ciphering
       algorithm that requires a 128-bit ciphering key is in use) and the GPRS GSM Kint (if a GIA integrity algorithm
       that requires a 128-bit integrity key is in use).

   -   An MS is attached for emergency bearer services if it has successfully completed an attach for emergency
       bearer services or if it has only a PDN connection for emergency bearer services established.

   -   idle mode: In this mode, the mobile station is not allocated any dedicated channel; it listens to the CCCH and the
       BCCH;

   -   group receive mode: (Only applicable for mobile stations supporting VGCS listening or VBS listening) In this
       mode, the mobile station is not allocated a dedicated channel with the network; it listens to the downlink of a
       voice broadcast channel or voice group call channel allocated to the cell. Occasionally, the mobile station has to
       listen to the BCCH of the serving cell as defined in 3GPP TS 43.022 [82] and 3GPP TS 45.008 [34];

   -   dedicated mode: In this mode, the mobile station is allocated at least two dedicated channels, only one of them
       being a SACCH;

   -   EAB: Extended Access Barring, see 3GPP TS 22.011 [138].

   -   group transmit mode: (Only applicable for mobile stations supporting VGCS talking) In this mode, one mobile
       station of a voice group call is allocated two dedicated channels, one of them being a SACCH. These channels
       can be allocated to one mobile station at a time but to different mobile stations during the voice group call;

   -   packet idle mode: (only applicable for mobile stations supporting GPRS) In this mode, mobile station is not
       allocated any radio resource on a packet data physical channel; it listens to the BCCH and the CCCH, see
       3GPP TS 44.060 [76].

   -   packet transfer mode: (only applicable for mobile stations supporting GPRS) In this mode, the mobile station is
       allocated radio resource on one or more packet data physical channels for the transfer of LLC PDUs.

   -   main DCCH: In dedicated mode and group transmit mode, only two channels are used as DCCH, one being a
       SACCH, the other being a SDCCH or a FACCH; the SDCCH or FACCH is called here "the main DCCH";

   -   A channel is activated if it can be used for transmission, in particular for signalling, at least with UI frames. On
       the SACCH, whenever activated, it must be ensured that a contiguous stream of layer 2 frames is sent;

   -   A TCH is connected if circuit mode user data can be transferred. A TCH cannot be connected if it is not
       activated. A TCH which is activated but not connected is used only for signalling, i.e. as a DCCH;

   -   The data link of SAPI 0 on the main DCCH is called the main signalling link. Any message specified to be sent
       on the main signalling link is sent in acknowledged mode except when otherwise specified;

   -   The term "to establish" a link is a short form for "to establish the multiframe mode" on that data link. It is
       possible to send UI frames on a data link even if it is not established as soon as the corresponding channel is
       activated. Except when otherwise indicated, a data link layer establishment is done without an information field.

   -   "channel set" is used to identify TCHs that carry related user information flows, e.g., in a multislot
       configuration used to support circuit switched connection(s), which therefore need to be handled together.

   -   A temporary block flow (TBF) is a physical connection used by the two RR peer entities to support the uni-
       directional transfer of LLC PDUs on packet data physical channels, see 3GPP TS 44.060 [76].

   -   RLC/MAC block: A RLC/MAC block is the protocol data unit exchanged between RLC/MAC entities, see
       3GPP TS 44.060 [76].

   -   A GMM context is established when a GPRS attach procedure is successfully completed.

   -   Network operation mode

       The network operation modes I and II are defined in 3GPP TS 23.060 [74].

       The network operation mode shall be indicated as system information. For proper operation, the network
       operation mode should be the same in each cell of one routing area.

4              Elementary procedures for Mobility Management

4.1            General
This clause describes the procedures used for mobility management for non-GPRS services and for GPRS-services at
the radio interface (Reference Point Um and Uu).

The main function of the Mobility Management sublayer is to support the mobility of user terminals, such as informing
the network of its present location and providing user identity confidentiality.

A further function of the MM sublayer is to provide connection management services to the different entities of the
upper Connection Management (CM) sublayer (see 3GPP TS 24.007 [20]).

There are two sets of procedures defined in this chapter:

    -   MM procedures for non-GPRS services (performed by the MM entity of the MM sublayer); and

    -   GMM procedures for GPRS services (performed by the GMM entity of the MM sublayer), see
        3GPP TS 24.007 [20].

All the MM procedures described in this clause can only be performed if a RR connection has been established between
the MS and the network. Else, the MM sublayer has to initiate the establishment of a RR connection (see
3GPP TS 44.018 [84] subclause 3.3 and 3GPP TS 25.331 [23c]).

In A/Gb mode, the GMM procedures described in this clause, use services provided by the RR sublayer without prior
RR connection establishment.

In Iu mode: all the GMM procedures described in this clause can only be performed if a PS signalling connection has
been established between the MS and the network. Else, the GMM sublayer has to initiate the establishment of a PS
signalling connection (see 3GPP TS 25.331 [23c]).

GMM procedures are mandatory and applicable only for GPRS MSs and networks supporting those MSs. For GPRS
MSs which are IMSI attached for both GPRS and non-GPRS services, some MM procedures are replaced by GMM
combined procedures provided that the network operates in network operation mode I, i.e. is supporting combined
GMM procedures. GMM combined procedures are not applicable for the GPRS MS operation mode C but are
mandatory for the GPRS MS operation modes A and B and networks supporting network operation mode I, see
3GPP TS 23.060 [74].


4.1.1          MM and GMM procedures

4.1.1.1           Types of MM and GMM procedures
Depending on how they can be initiated, three types of MM procedures can be distinguished:

    1) MM common procedures:

        A MM common procedure can always be initiated whilst a RR connection exists. The procedures belonging to
        this type are:

           Initiated by the network:

           -   TMSI reallocation procedure;

           -   authentication procedure;

           -   identification procedure;



                                                            ETSI
3GPP TS 24.008 version 15.8.0 Release 15                  48                       ETSI TS 124 008 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


          -   MM information procedure;

          -   abort procedure.

However, abort procedure is used only if an MM connection is being established or has already been established i.e. not
during MM specific procedures or during IMSI detach procedure, see subclause 4.3.5.

          Initiated by the mobile station:

          -   IMSI detach procedure (with the exceptions specified in subclause 4.3.4).

   2) MM specific procedures:

       A MM specific procedure can only be initiated if no other MM specific procedure is running or no MM
       connection exists. The procedures belonging to this type are:

          -   normal location updating procedure;

          -   periodic updating procedure;

          -   IMSI attach procedure; and

          -   eCall inactivity procedure.

   3) MM connection management procedures:

These procedures are used to establish, maintain and release a MM connection between the mobile station and the
network, over which an entity of the upper CM layer can exchange information with its peer. A MM connection
establishment can only be performed if no MM specific procedure is running. More than one MM connection may be
active at the same time.

Depending on how they can be initiated, three types of GMM procedures can be distinguished:

   1) GMM common procedures:

       In Iu mode, a GMM common procedure can always be initiated whilst a PS signalling connection exists.

       The procedures belonging to this type are:

          Initiated by the network when a GMM context has been established:

          -   P-TMSI (re-) allocation;

          -   GPRS authentication and ciphering;

          -   GPRS identification;

          -   GPRS information.

   2) GMM specific procedures:

          Initiated by the network and used to detach the IMSI in the network for GPRS services and/or non-GPRS
          services and to release a GMM context:

          -   GPRS detach.

          Initiated by the MS and used to attach or detach the IMSI in the network for GPRS services and/or non-
          GPRS services and to establish or release a GMM context:

          -   GPRS attach and combined GPRS attach;

          -   GPRS detach and combined GPRS detach;

          -   eCall inactivity procedure.

          Initiated by the MS when a GMM context has been established:

          -   normal routing area updating and combined routing area updating;

4.1.1.1.1            Integrity Checking of Signalling Messages in the Mobile Station (Iu mode only)
In Iu mode only, integrity protected signalling is mandatory with one exception regarding emergency calls (see
subclause 4.1.1.1.1a). In Iu mode only, all layer 3 protocols shall use integrity protected signalling once the security
mode procedure has been successfully activated in the network and the MS. Integrity protection of all layer 3 signalling
messages is the responsibility of lower layers. It is the network which activates integrity protection. This is done using
the security mode control procedure (3GPP TS 25.331 [23c] and 3GPP TS 44.118 [111]).

The supervision that integrity protection is activated shall be the responsibility of the MM and GMM layer in the MS
(see 3GPP TS 33.102 [5a]). In order to do this, the lower layers shall provide the MM and GMM layer with an
indication on when the integrity protection is activated in the MS (i.e. one indication to the MM layer when a security
mode control procedure for the CS domain is processed successfully and one indication to the GMM layer when a
security mode control procedure for the PS domain is processed successfully).

The CS and PS domains in the network and the MM and GMM layers in the MS, are not aware of whether integrity
protection has been started in the lower layers by the other domain. It is mandatory for the network to initiate one
security mode control procedure for the CS domain and one for the PS domain.

Except the messages listed below, no layer 3 signalling messages shall be processed by the receiving MM and GMM
entities or forwarded to the CM entities, unless the network has activated the integrity protection for that domain.

          -   AUTHENTICATION REQUEST

          -   AUTHENTICATION REJECT

          -   DETACH ACCEPT (for non power-off)

          -   ATTACH ACCEPT, if the ATTACH ACCEPT is the response to an ATTACH REQUEST with attach
              type set to "emergency attach".

          -   SERVICE ACCEPT, if any of the following conditions applies:

              -   the MM entity in the MS has received a CM SERVICE ACCEPT message with no ciphering or
                  integrity protection applied as response to a CM SERVICE REQUEST message, with CM SERVICE
                  TYPE set to ‘Emergency call establishment’ sent to the network.; or

              -   the MM connection was established locally due to the SRVCC handover of a PDN connection for
                  emergency bearer services for which the "null integrity protection algorithm" EIA0 has been used

   -   SM messages:

          -   all SM messages, if any of the following conditions applies:

              -   the GMM entity in the MS has received an ATTACH ACCEPT message with neither ciphering nor
                  integrity protection applied in response to an ATTACH REQUEST message, with attach type set to
                  "emergency attach"; or

              -   the MS has performed intersystem change from S1 mode to Iu mode with a PDN connection for
                  emergency bearer services for which the "null integrity protection algorithm" EIA0 has been used
                  while in S1 mode.

Once integrity protection is activated, the receiving layer 3 entity in the MS shall not process any layer 3 signalling
messages unless they have been successfully integrity checked by the lower layers. If any signalling messages, having

not successfully passed the integrity check, are received, then the lower layers in the MS shall discard that message (see
3GPP TS 25.331 [23c] and 3GPP TS 44.118 [111]). If any layer 3 signalling message is received, in either PS or CS
domains, as not integrity protected even though the integrity protection has been activated in the MS by that domain in
the network, then the lower layers shall discard this message (see 3GPP TS 25.331 [23c] and 3GPP TS 44.118 [111]).

Integrity checking on the network side is performed by the RNC and is described in 3GPP TS 25.331 [23c] and
3GPP TS 44.118 [111].

4.1.1.1.1a           Integrity protection for emergency call (Iu mode only)
The network should initiate the security mode procedure for an emergency call, in the same way as it would for any
other call except in the cases defined in sub-clause "Security Procedures Not Applied" in 3GPP TS 33.102 [5a].

For the establishment of a MM connection for an emergency call when no other MM connection is established (e.g. for
an emergency call initiated without a SIM/USIM no other MM connections can exist) the decision on whether or not to
apply the security procedures shall be made by the network as defined in the subclause "Emergency Call Handling" in
3GPP TS 33.102 [5a]. If the MM connection was established locally due to the SRVCC handover of a PDN connection
for emergency bearer services for which the "null integrity protection algorithm" EIA0 has been used while in S1 mode
or for which integrity protection has not been activated while in Iu mode, the network need not apply the security
procedures for this call.

For an attach for emergency bearer services, (e.g. initiated without a SIM/USIM) the decision on whether or not to
apply the security procedures shall be made by the network as defined in the subclause "Emergency Call Handling" in
3GPP TS 33.102 [5a]. After intersystem change from S1 mode to Iu mode with a PDN connection for emergency bearer
services for which the "null integrity protection algorithm" EIA0 has been used while in S1 mode, the network need not
apply the security procedures for this connection.

4.1.1.2           MM-GMM co-ordination for GPRS MS's

4.1.1.2.1            GPRS MS operating in mode A or B in a network that operates in mode I
If the network operates in mode I, GPRS MSes that operate in mode A or B and wish to be or are simultaneously IMSI
attached for GPRS and non-GPRS services, shall use the combined GPRS attach and the combined and periodic routing
area updating procedures instead of the corresponding MM specific procedures IMSI attach and normal and periodic
location area updating.

A GPRS MS operating in mode A or B in a network that operates in mode I, shall perform the combined GPRS attach
or routing area update procedure regardless the value of the ATT flag.

If a GPRS MS is operating in mode A or B in a network that operates in mode I the IMSI detach shall be performed by
the GMM using the combined GPRS detach procedure.

A GPRS MS operating in mode A or B in a network that operates in mode I, shall perform the combined GPRS detach
procedure regardless the value of the ATT flag.

A GPRS MS operating in mode A or B in network that operates in mode I, shall use the combined GMM specific
procedures in place of the MM specific procedures unless the re-activation of the MM specific procedures is explicitly
described, so all conditions describing when to trigger an MM specific procedure listed in subclauses 4.3 and 4.4 shall
not apply.

A GPRS MS operating in mode A or B in a network that operates in mode I should not use any MM timers relating to
MM specific procedures, (e.g. T3210, T3211, T3212, T3213) unless the re-activation of the MM specific procedures is
explicitly described. If the MM timers are already running, the MS should not react on the expiration of the timers.

   NOTE 1: Whenever GMM performs a combined GMM procedure, a GPRS MS enters the MM state MM
           LOCATION UPDATING PENDING in order to prevent the MM from performing a location area
           updating procedure.

If the authentication procedure is performed by MM and the authentication is rejected by the network (i.e. upon receive
of AUTHENTICATION REJECT), the MS shall in addition set the GPRS update status to GU3 ROAMING NOT
ALLOWED and shall, if available, delete the P-TMSI, P-TMSI signature, RAI and GPRS ciphering key sequence
number stored. The SIM/USIM shall be considered as invalid for GPRS and non-GPRS services until switching off or
the SIM/USIM is removed. The MS shall abort any GMM procedure and shall enter state GMM-DEREGISTERED. If
S1 mode is supported in the MS, the MS shall handle the EMM parameters EPS update status, GUTI, last visited
registered TAI, TAI list and KSI as specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 [120] for the case when the EPS authentication is not
accepted by the network.

If the PS or CS domain is barred because of domain specific access control, a GPRS MS operating in mode A or B in a
network that operates in mode I shall act as if in network operation mode II and access to the barred domain shall be
stopped entirely. If the MS detects that a domain is barred, this shall not trigger any MM or GMM specific procedure.

A GPRS MS operating in mode A or B in a network that operates in mode I shall perform a normal location updating
procedure (in order to remove the Gs association in the MSC/VLR) when the following conditions are fulfilled:

   -   the GPRS MS has camped on a cell where the PS domain is barred and the CS domain is unbarred; and

   -   T3312, T3311, T3302, or T3330 expires; and

   -   for the last attempt to update the registration of the location area a combined GMM procedure was performed.

Additionally the MS shall treat the expiry of T3312 when the PS domain changes from barred to unbarred, analogous to
the descriptions for the cases when the timer expires out of coverage or in a cell that does not support GPRS (see
subclause 4.7.2.2).

If timer T3312 expires and both the PS and CS domain are barred, then a GPRS MS operating in mode A or B in a
network that operates in mode I shall treat the expiry of T3312 when the GPRS MS detects that the PS or CS domain
becomes unbarred, analogous to the descriptions for the cases when the timer expires out of coverage (see
subclause 4.7.2.2).

If the PS domain is barred and timer T3312 expires during an ongoing CS connection, then a GPRS MS operating in
mode A or B in a network that operates in mode I shall treat the expiry of T3312 when the MM state MM-IDLE is
entered, analogous to the descriptions for the cases when the timer expires out of coverage or in a cell that does not
support GPRS (see subclause 4.7.2.2), or in a cell where the PS domain is barred.

A GPRS MS operating in mode A or B in a network that operates in mode I shall perform a combined routing area
update procedure indicating "combined RA/LA updating with IMSI attach" (in order to establish the Gs association in
the MSC/VLR) when the following conditions are fulfilled:

   -   the GPRS MS detects that CS or PS domain or both change from barred to unbarred;

   -   as a result of the change of the domain specific barring status, both domains are unbarred; and

   -   for the last attempt to update the registration of the location area an MM specific procedure was performed (see
       subclause 4.7.5.2.1) or for the last attempt to update the registration of the routing area a normal routing area
       update was performed.

A GPRS MS operating in mode A or B on a PLMN which is part of "forbidden PLMNs for GPRS service" list in a
network that is operating in mode I shall act as if in network operation mode II and proceed with appropriate MM
procedures.

4.1.1.2.2            GPRS MS operating in mode A or B in a network that operates in mode II
If the network operates in mode II, a GPRS MS that operates in mode A or B and wishes to be or is simultaneously
IMSI attached for GPRS and non-GPRS services, shall use the MM specific procedures listed in subclauses 4.3 and 4.4
and the GMM specific procedures listed in subclauses 4.7.3, 4.7.4 and 4.7.5. The applicability of periodic location
updating is further specified in subclause 4.4.2 and the periodic routing area updating is specified in subclause 4.7.2.2.
If the GPRS MS, which operates in mode A or B, wishes to be IMSI attached for GPRS and "SMS-only service"or is
simultaneously IMSI attached for GPRS and non-GPRS services in order to obtain GPRS services and "SMS-only
service", then the GPRS MS shall first complete the GMM specific procedure before performing the MM specific
procedures. If this GPRS MS receives in the ATTACH ACCEPT or ROUTING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message
the Additional network feature support IE indicating "SMS via GPRS supported", then the GPRS MS shall not perform
the MM specific procedure until a new ATTACH ACCEPT or ROUTING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message

indicating "SMS via GPRS not supported" or the GPRS MS does not wish to be IMSI attached only for GPRS and
"SMS-only service".

If the authentication procedure is performed by MM and the authentication is rejected by the network (i.e upon receive
of AUTHENTICATION REJECT), the MS shall in addition set the GPRS update status to GU3 ROAMING NOT
ALLOWED and shall, if available, delete the P-TMSI, P-TMSI signature, RAI and GPRS ciphering key sequence
number stored. The SIM/USIM shall be considered as invalid for GPRS and non-GPRS services until switching off or
the SIM/USIM is removed. The MS shall abort any GMM procedure and shall enter state GMM-DEREGISTERED. If
S1 mode is supported in the MS, the MS shall handle the EMM parameters EPS update status, GUTI, last visited
registered TAI, TAI list and KSI as specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 [120] for the case when the EPS authentication is not
accepted by the network.

If the PS or CS domain is barred because of domain specific access control, a GPRS MS operating in mode A or B in a
network that operates in mode II shall use the MM specific procedures or GMM specific procedures, respectively, in the
domain which is unbarred. If the MS detects that a domain changes from barred to unbarred, it shall behave as specified
in subclauses 4.3.4.4, 4.4.4.9, 4.5.1.2, 4.7.3.1.5, 4.7.4.1.4, 4.7.5.1.5, and 4.7.13.5.

See subclause 5.1.4 in 3GPP TS 24.301 [120].

4.1.1.3          Core Network System Information for MM (Iu mode only)
In the network broadcast system information some of the system information is used by MM.

At reception of new system information, the RRC layer in the MS delivers the contents of the CN common system
information and the CS domain specific system information to the MM layer in the MS.

The Core Network system information is included in specific information elements within some RRC messages sent to
MS (see 3GPP TS 25.331 [23c] and 3GPP TS 44.118 [111]). In the Core Network system information the Common
system information part and the CS domain specific system information part contains settings of parameters controlling
MM functionality. No MM messages contain the Core Network System Information.

4.1.1.4          Core Network System Information for GMM (Iu mode only)

4.1.1.4.1            General
In the network broadcast system information some of the system information is used by GMM.

At reception of new system information, the RRC layer in the MS delivers the contents of the CN common system
information and the PS domain specific system information to the GMM layer in the MS.

The Core Network system information is included in specific information elements within some RRC messages sent to

GMM functionality. No GMM messages contain the Core Network System Information.

4.1.1.4.2            Control of Network Mode of Operation I
The behaviour of the MS with respect to NMO I is determined by the combination of PS domain specific system
information IE as defined in subclause 10.5.1.12.3 and the setting of the parameter "NMO_I_Behaviour" in the NAS
configuration Management Object as specified in 3GPP TS 24.368 [135] or in USIM file NASCONFIG as specified in

4.1.1.5           Access class control
The network can restrict the access for certain groups of mobile stations. These groups are also known as access classes.

The restriction can apply for access to both domains (common access class control or EAB, depending on EAB
configuration) or to one domain only (domain specific access control) (see 3GPP TS 23.122 [14]).

Additionally, the network can alleviate the access restriction in both domains or domain specifically, and allow
restricted mobile stations to respond to paging messages or to perform generic location updating, or GPRS attach or
routing area updating procedure.

A network operator can also restrict some MSs to access the network for location registration, although via common
access class control or domain specific access class control the MSs are permitted to access the network for other
purposes. Therefore, for each access to the network the mobile station shall determine from the information received via
the system information broadcast whether access is allowed or not:

   -   For paging response the mobile station shall evaluate the control information for common access control (as
       specified in 3GPP TS 44.018 [84], 3GPP TS 44.060 [76], and 3GPP TS 25.331 [23c]), the control information
       for EAB (as specified in 3GPP TS 44.018 [84], and 3GPP TS 25.331 [23c]), domain specific access control (as
       specified in 3GPP TS 44.018 [84] and 3GPP TS 25.331 [23c]), and the specific control information for paging
       response (as specified in 3GPP TS 25.331 [23c]; see "Paging Permission with Access Control").

   -   For generic location updating, GPRS attach and routing area updating procedures the mobile station shall
       evaluate the control information for:

       -   common access control (as specified in 3GPP TS 44.018 [84], 3GPP TS 44.060 [76], and
           3GPP TS 25.331 [23c]);

       -   domain specific access control (as specified in 3GPP TS 44.018 [84] and 3GPP TS 25.331 [23c]);

       -   specific control information for location registration (as specified in 3GPP TS 25.331 [23c]; see "Paging
           Permission with Access Control"); and

       -   EAB as specified for A/Gb mode in 3GPP TS 44.018 [84], and for Iu mode in 3GPP TS 25.331 [23c].

       The same control information shall also be taken into account, when the present document requires the mobile
       station to initiate a generic location updating, or GPRS attach or routing area updating procedure when it detects
       that a domain changes from barred to unbarred (see e.g. subclauses 4.1.1.2.1 and 4.1.1.2.2).

   -   For GPRS attach and routing area updating procedures in Iu mode, the mobile station shall evaluate the control
       information for:

       -   ACDC if the mobile station supports ACDC (as specified in 3GPP TS 25.331 [23c]).

       The same control information shall also be taken into account, when the present document requires the mobile
       station to initiate a GPRS attach or routing area updating procedure in Iu mode when it detects that PS domain
       changes from barred to unbarred (see e.g. subclauses 4.1.1.2.1 and 4.1.1.2.2).

   -   For all other purposes the mobile station shall evaluate the control information for common access control as
       specified in 3GPP TS 44.018 [84], 3GPP TS 44.060 [76], and 3GPP TS 25.331 [23c], the control information for
       EAB (as specified in 3GPP TS 44.018 [84], and 3GPP TS 25.331 [23c]), domain specific access control (as
       specified in 3GPP TS 44.018 [84] and 3GPP TS 25.331 [23c]) and in Iu mode for PS domain if the mobile
       station supports ACDC, the control information for ACDC (as specified in 3GPP TS 25.331 [23c]).

4.1.1.6           Specific requirements for MS configured to use timer T3245
The following requirement applies for an MS that is configured to use timer T3245 (see 3GPP TS 24.368 [135] or
3GPP TS 31.102 [112]):

When the MS adds a PLMN identity to the "forbidden PLMN list" or the "forbidden PLMNs for GPRS service" list or
sets the SIM/USIM as invalid for non-GPRS services or GPRS services or both, and timer T3245 is not running, the MS

Upon expiry of the timer T3245, the MS shall erase the "forbidden PLMN list" and the "forbidden PLMNs for GPRS
service" list and set the SIM/USIM to valid for non-GPRS services and GPRS services. When the lists are erased, the
MS performs a cell selection according to 3GPP TS 43.022 [82] and 3GPP TS 25.304 [98].

If the MS is switched off when the timer T3245 is running, the MS shall behave as follows when the MS is switched on
and the SIM/USIM in the MS remains the same:

   -   let t1 be the time remaining for T3245 timeout at switch off and let t be the time elapsed between switch off and
       switch on. If t1 is greater than t, then the timer shall be restarted with the value t1 – t. If t1 is equal to or less than
       t, then the MS will follow the behaviour as defined in the paragraph above upon expiry of the timer T3245. If the
       MS is not capable of determining t, then the MS shall restart the timer with the value t1.

4.1.1.6A          Specific requirements for the MS when receiving non-integrity protected
                  reject messages
This subclause specifies the requirements for an MS that is not configured to use timer T3245 (see
3GPP TS 24.368 [135] or 3GPP TS 31.102 [112]) and receives a LOCATION UPDATING REJECT, CM SERVICE
REJECT, ABORT, ATTACH REJECT, ROUTING AREA UPDATE REJECT or SERVICE REJECT message without
integrity protection with specific MM or GMM causes.

   NOTE 1: Additional MS requirements for this case, requirements for other MM or GMM causes, and requirements
           for the case when the MS receives a successfully integrity checked reject message are specified in
           subclauses 4.4.4.7, 4.5.1.1, 4.7.3.1.4, 4.7.3.2.4, 4.7.5.1.4, 4.7.5.2.4 and 4.7.13.4.

The present subclause is applicable to A/Gb mode and Iu mode. In A/Gb mode,

   -   for the CS domain, as integrity protection is not supported, all messages received by the MS are considered to be
       received "before the network has activated the integrity protection"; and

   -   for the PS domain, if integrity protection is not required (see subclause 4.7.1.2a.), all messages received by the
       MS are considered to be received "before the network has activated the integrity protection".

The MS may maintain a list of PLMN-specific attempt counters and a list of PLMN-specific PS-attempt counters. The
maximum number of possible entries in each list is implementation dependent.

Additionally, the MS may maintain one counter for "SIM/USIM considered invalid for non-GPRS services" events and
one counter for "SIM/USIM considered invalid for GPRS services" events.

The MS may also maintain a list of "forbidden location areas for non-GPRS services" and a list of "forbidden location
areas for GPRS services". If the MS is in a location area which is included in the list of "forbidden location areas for
non-GPRS services", the MS shall not initiate any MM procedure. If the MS is in a location area which is included in
the list of "forbidden location areas for GPRS services", the MS shall not initiate any GMM, SM, SMS or SS procedure
for GPRS services.

If the MS receives a LOCATION UPDATING REJECT message without integrity protection with MM cause value #2,
#3, #6, #11, #12, #13 or #15 before the network has activated the integrity protection for the CS domain, the MS shall
start timer T3247 with a random value uniformly drawn from the range between 30 minutes and 60 minutes, if the timer
is not running, and take the following actions:

   1) if the MM cause value received is #3 or #6, and

       a) if the MS maintains a counter for "SIM/USIM considered invalid for non-GPRS services" events and the
          counter has a value less than an MS implementation-specific maximum value, the MS shall:

          i) delete any LAI, TMSI and ciphering key sequence number stored in the SIM/USIM, reset the location
             update attempt counter, and set the update status to ROAMING NOT ALLOWED (and store it in the
             SIM/USIM according to subclause 4.1.2.2);

              delete the list of equivalent PLMNs;

              in Iu mode, increment the counter for "SIM/USIM considered invalid for non-GPRS services" events, if
              not already incremented over the same RRC connection;

              in A/Gb mode, increment the counter for "SIM/USIM considered invalid for non-GPRS services" events;

             for roaming"; otherwise store the current LAI in the list of "forbidden location areas for GPRS services"
             and the MS shall enter the state GMM-DEREGISTERED.LIMITED-SERVICE.

If the MS receives a SERVICE REJECT message without integrity protection with GMM cause value #3, #6, #7, #8,
#11, #12, #13 or #15 before the network has activated the integrity protection for the PS domain, the MS shall start
timer T3247 with a random value uniformly drawn from the range between 30 minutes and 60 minutes, if the timer is
not running, and proceed as specified under items 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 above.

Upon expiry of timer T3247, the MS shall:

   -   erase the list of "forbidden location areas for regional provision of service" and the list of "forbidden location
       areas for roaming";

   -   set the SIM/USIM to valid for non-GPRS services, if

       -   the MS does not maintain a counter for "SIM/USIM considered invalid for non-GPRS services" events; or

       -   the MS maintains a counter for "SIM/USIM considered invalid for non-GPRS services" events and this
           counter has a value less than an MS implementation-specific maximum value.

   -   set the SIM/USIM to valid for GPRS services, if

       -   the MS does not maintain a counter for "SIM/USIM considered invalid for GPRS services" events; or

       -   the MS maintains a counter for "SIM/USIM considered invalid for GPRS services" events and this counter
           has a value less than an MS implementation-specific maximum value.

   -   erase the list of "forbidden location areas for non-GPRS services" and the list of "forbidden location areas for
       GPRS services", if the MS maintains these lists;

   -   if the MS maintains a list of PLMN-specific attempt counters, for each PLMN-specific attempt counter that has a
       value greater than zero and less than an MS implementation-specific maximum value, remove the respective
       PLMN from the forbidden PLMN list;

   -   if the MS maintains a list of PLMN-specific PS-attempt counters, for each PLMN-specific PS-attempt counter
       that has a value greater than zero and less than an MS implementation-specific maximum value, remove the
       respective PLMN from the "forbidden PLMNs for GPRS service" list. If the resulting "forbidden PLMNs for
       GPRS service" list is empty and the MS is supporting S1 mode, the MS re-enables the E-UTRA capability as
       specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 [120] for the case when timer T3247 expires;

   -   if the MS is supporting S1 mode, handle the list of "forbidden tracking areas for regional provision of service"
       and the list of "forbidden tracking areas for roaming" as specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 [120] for the case when
       timer T3247 expires; and

   -   initiate a location updating procedure, GPRS attach procedure or routing area updating procedure, if still needed,
       dependent on MM state and update status, and GMM state and GPRS update status, or perform a PLMN
       selection according to 3GPP TS 23.122 [14].

If the MS maintains a list of PLMN-specific attempt counters and PLMN-specific PS-attempt counters, when the MS is
switched off, the MS shall, for each PLMN-specific attempt counter that has a value greater than zero and less than the
MS implementation-specific maximum value, remove the respective PLMN from the forbidden PLMN list. When the
SIM/USIM is removed, the MS should perform this action.

   NOTE 4: If the respective PLMN was stored in the extension of the "forbidden PLMNs" list, then according to
           3GPP TS 23.122 [14] the MS will delete the contents of this extension when the SIM/USIM is removed.

4.1.1.7           Handling of NAS level mobility management congestion control
The network may detect GMM or MM signalling congestion and perform NAS level mobility management congestion
control. PS domain NAS level mobility management congestion control consists of general NAS level mobility
management congestion control and subscribed APN based congestion control. CS domain NAS level mobility
management congestion control consists of general NAS level mobility management congestion control.

Under NAS level mobility management congestion control the network may reject mobility management signalling
requests from MSs as specified in 3GPP TS 23.060 [74]. The network should not reject requests for emergency bearer
services.




                                                           ETSI
3GPP TS 24.008 version 15.8.0 Release 15                       61                          ETSI TS 124 008 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


When subscribed APN based congestion control is active for a particular APN, the network may reject attach request
from MSs with subscription to this APN.

In mobility management the network may detect NAS signalling congestion. The network may start or stop performing
the subscribed APN based congestion control based on mobility management level criteria such as:

   -   rate of mobility management NAS messages from a group of MSs with a subscription to a particular APN
       exceeds or falls below certain thresholds; or

   -   setting in network management.

When the NAS level mobility management congestion control is active, the network may include a value for the
mobility management back-off timer T3246 or T3346 in the reject messages. The MS starts the mobility management
back-off timer with the value received in the mobility management reject messages. To avoid that large numbers of
MSs simultaneously initiate deferred requests, the network should select the value for the mobility management back-
off timer for the rejected MSs so that timeouts are not synchronised.

For subscribed APN based congestion control the value of timer T3346 for a particular APN may be APN dependent.

If the timer T3346 is running when the MS enters state GMM-DEREGISTERED, the MS remains switched on, and the
SIM/USIM in the MS remains the same, then timer T3346 is kept running until it expires or it is stopped.

If the MS is switched off when the timer T3246 or T3346 is running, the MS shall behave as follows for each running
timer when the MS is switched on and the SIM/USIM in the MS remains the same:

   -   let t1 be the time remaining until timeout at switch off and let t be the time elapsed between switch off and
       switch on. If t1 is greater than t, then the timer shall be restarted with the value t1 – t. If t1 is equal to or less than
       t, then the timer need not be restarted. If the MS is not capable of determining t, then the MS shall restart the
       timer with the value t1; and

   -   if prior to switch off, timer T3346 was started due to a NAS request message (ATTACH REQUEST, ROUTING
       AREA UPDATE REQUEST or SERVICE REQUEST) which contained the low priority indicator set to "MS is
       configured for NAS signalling low priority", then if timer T3346 is restarted at switch on, the MS configured for
       low priority shall handle mobility management requests as indicated in subclauses 4.7.3.1.5, 4.7.5.1.5
       and 4.7.13.5.

If the MS enters a new PLMN while timer T3246 is running, and the new PLMN is not equivalent to the PLMN where
the MS started timer T3246, the MS shall stop timer T3246 when initiating mobility management procedures in the new
PLMN.

If the MS enters a new PLMN while timer T3346 is running, and the new PLMN is not equivalent to the PLMN where
the MS started timer T3346, the MS shall stop timer T3346 when initiating mobility management procedures in the new
PLMN.

At an inter-system change from S1 mode to A/Gb mode or from Iu mode to A/Gb mode within the same RA, if the
timer T3346 is running and the TIN indicates "RAT-related TMSI", the MS shall set the GPRS update status to GU2
NOT UPDATED and enter state GMM-REGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-UPDATE.

After change in RAI, if the timer T3346 is running and GPRS update status is GU1 UPDATED then MS shall set the
GPRS update status to GU2 NOT UPDATED and enter state GMM-REGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-UPDATE.

After change in LAI, if the timer T3246 is running and MM update status is U1 UPDATED then MS shall set the MM
update status to U2 NOT UPDATED and enter state MM IDLE, ATTEMPTING TO UPDATE.

4.1.1.8           Handling of security related parameters at switch on and switch off
At switch on, an ME supporting UTRAN Iu mode shall proceed as follows:

   -   if a USIM is inserted, the ME shall read the STARTCS and STARTPS value from the USIM. If STARTCS and/or
       STARTPS read from the USIM are greater than or equal to the maximum value of STARTCS and STARTPS
       provided on the USIM (see 3GPP TS 31.102 [112]) or the CKSN or GPRS CKSN stored on the USIM indicates
       "no key available", the ME shall set the START value in the volatile memory of the ME for the corresponding
       core network domain(s) to zero. In addition if the read STARTCS and/or STARTPS are greater than or equal to the
       maximum value, the ME shall delete the corresponding CKSN or GPRS CKSN from the ME and the USIM. The

3GPP TS 24.008 version 15.8.0 Release 15                     62                        ETSI TS 124 008 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


       ME shall set the STARTCS and STARTPS value on the USIM to the maximum value of STARTCS and STARTPS
       provided on the USIM (see 3GPP TS 31.102 [112]); and

   -   if a SIM is inserted, the ME shall read the STARTCS and STARTPS value from the non-volatile memory. If
       STARTCS and/or STARTPS read from the non-volatile memory are greater than or equal to the default value
       specified in 3GPP TS 33.102 [5a], subclause 6.8.2.4 or the CKSN or GPRS CKSN stored on the SIM indicates
       "no key available", the ME shall set the START value in the volatile memory of the ME for the corresponding
       core network domain(s) to zero. In addition if the read STARTCS and/or STARTPS are greater than or equal to the
       default value, the ME shall delete the corresponding CKSN or GPRS CKSN from the ME. The ME shall set the
       STARTCS and STARTPS value in the non-volatile memory to the default value specified in 3GPP TS 33.102 [5a],
       subclause 6.8.2.4.

   NOTE:      The lower layer handles the STARTCS and STARTPS value stored in the volatile memory of the ME as
              specified in 3GPP TS 25.331 [23c].

Only at switch off, an ME supporting UTRAN Iu mode shall proceed for each of the two domains, CS and PS, as
follows:

   -   if since switch on the ME performed an authentication procedure for the respective domain and stored the new
       security context on the USIM or SIM, and the new security context was not taken into use, the ME shall set the
       START value for this domain on the USIM or, if a SIM is inserted, in the non-volatile memory to zero; and

   -   otherwise, if a security context for the respective domain is stored on the USIM or SIM, i.e. the CKSN or GPRS
       CKSN stored on the USIM or SIM is different from "no key available", the ME shall store the current START
       value used by the lower layer for this domain on the USIM or, if a SIM is inserted, in the non-volatile memory.

4.1.1.9           Equivalent PLMNs list
The mobile equipment shall store a list of "equivalent PLMNs". These PLMNs shall be regarded by the MS as
equivalent to each other for PLMN selection and cell selection/re-selection. The same list is used by EMM, GMM and
MM.

The list of equivalent PLMNs is replaced or deleted at the end of each location updating procedure, routing area
updating procedure and GPRS attach procedure. The stored list consists of a list of equivalent PLMNs as downloaded
by the network plus the PLMN code of the registered PLMN that downloaded the list. The stored list shall not be
deleted when the MS is switched off. The stored list shall be deleted if the SIM/USIM is removed or when an MS
attached for emergency bearer services enters the state GMM-DEREGISTERED. The maximum number of possible
entries in the stored list is 16.

4.1.1.10          Dedicated core network
The network may reject mobility management signalling requests from MSs due to dedicated core network as specified
in 3GPP TS 23.060 [74]. When the network rejects mobility management signalling requests due to dedicated core
network, the mechanism for general NAS level mobility management congestion control as specified in
subclause 4.1.1.7 shall be followed.


4.1.2         MM sublayer states
The description of the states for the MM sublayer is organized as follows. The main states for the MS side, related to
the procedures, are described in subclause 4.1.2.1.1. The MM IDLE state is subdivided in substates for the description
of the behaviour in idle mode (subclause 4.1.2.1.2). This behaviour depends on an update status, described in
subclause 4.1.2.2. The states for the network side are described in subclause 4.1.2.3.

4.1.2.1           MM sublayer states in the mobile station
In this subclause, the possible states for the MM sublayer in the mobile station is described. In figure 4.1 of the present
document, an overview of the MM sublayer protocol is given.

         The mobile station is inactive (e.g. power down). Important parameters are stored. Only manual action by the
         user may transfer the MM sublayer to another state.

      3 LOCATION UPDATING INITIATED

         A location updating procedure has been started and the MM awaits a response from the network. The timer
         T3210 is running.

      5 WAIT FOR OUTGOING MM CONNECTION

         The MM connection establishment has been started, and the MM awaits a response from the network. The
         timer T3230 is running.

      6 MM CONNECTION ACTIVE

         The MM sublayer has a RR connection to its peer entity on the network side. One or more MM connections
         are active.

      7 IMSI DETACH INITIATED

         The IMSI detach procedure has been started. The timer T3220 is running.

      8 PROCESS CM SERVICE PROMPT

         The MM sublayer has a RR connection to its peer entity on the network side. The Mobile Station has
         received a CM SERVICE PROMPT message but has not yet responded $(CCBS)$.

      9 WAIT FOR NETWORK COMMAND

         The MM sublayer has a RR connection to its peer entity in the network, but no MM connection is
         established. The mobile station is passive, awaiting further commands from the network. The timer T3240
         may be running.

      10 LOCATION UPDATE REJECTED

         A location updating procedure has been rejected and RR connection release is awaited. The timer T3240 is
         running.

      13. WAIT FOR RR CONNECTION (LOCATION UPDATING)

         The MM sublayer has requested RR connection establishment for starting the location updating procedure.

      14. WAIT FOR RR CONNECTION (MM CONNECTION)

         The MM sublayer has requested RR connection establishment for dedicated mode for starting the MM
         connection establishment.

      15. WAIT FOR RR CONNECTION (IMSI DETACH)

         The MM sublayer has requested RR connection establishment for starting the IMSI detach procedure.

       17. WAIT FOR REESTABLISH

          A lower layer failure has occurred and re-establishment may be performed from the disturbed CM layer
          entities.

       18. WAIT FOR RR ACTIVE

          The MM sublayer has requested activation of the RR sublayer.

       19. MM IDLE

          There is no MM procedure running and no RR connection exists except that a local MM context may exist
          when the RR sublayer is in Group Receive mode. This is a compound state, and the actual behaviour of the
          mobile station to Connection Management requests is determined by the actual substate as described
          hereafter.

       20. WAIT FOR ADDITIONAL OUTGOING MM CONNECTION.

          The MM connection establishment for an additional MM connection has been started, and the MM awaits
          response from the network.

       21. MM CONNECTION ACTIVE (GROUP TRANSMIT MODE)

          (Only applicable for mobile stations supporting VGCS talking:) The MM sublayer has a RR connection on
          the VGCS channel to its peer entity on the network side. Only one MM connection is active.

       22. WAIT FOR RR CONNECTION (GROUP TRANSMIT MODE)

          (Only applicable for mobile stations supporting VGCS talking:) The MM sublayer has requested to perform
          an uplink access on the VGCS channel.

       23. LOCATION UPDATING PENDING

          (Only applicable for GPRS MS operation modes A and B; not shown in figure 4.1a) A location updating has
          been started using the combined GPRS attach procedure or the combined GPRS routing area updating
          procedure.

       24. IMSI DETACH PENDING

          (Only applicable for GPRS MS operation modes A and B; not shown in figure 4.1a) An IMSI detach for non-
          GPRS services has been started using the combined GPRS detach procedure at not switching off.

       25. RR CONNECTION RELEASE NOT ALLOWED

          (Only applicable for mobile stations supporting RRLP procedures (see 3GPP TS 44.031 [23b]) or LCS
          procedures over RRC (see 3GPP TS 25.331 [23c])). All MM connections are released by their CM entities,
          but the RR connection is maintained by the network due to an ongoing RRLP procedure or LCS procedure
          over RRC.

4.1.2.1.2            Substates of the MM IDLE state
For the description of the behaviour of the MS the MM IDLE state is subdivided in several substates, also called the
service states. The service state pertains to the whole MS (ME alone if no SIM/USIM is inserted, or ME plus
SIM/USIM). The service state depends on the update status (see subclause 4.1.2.2) and on the selected cell.

       19.1 NORMAL SERVICE

          Valid subscriber data are available, update status is U1, a cell is selected that belongs to the LA where the
          subscriber is registered.

          In this state, all requests from the CM layers are treated normally.

       19.2 ATTEMPTING TO UPDATE

          Valid subscriber data are available, update status is U2 and a cell is selected. Requests from upper layers are
          accepted. Emergency call requests are treated normally, otherwise the request triggers first a location

         updating attempt in the selected cell, and then triggers the needed procedure only in case of successful
         location updating, otherwise the request is rejected.

      19.3 LIMITED SERVICE

         Valid subscriber data are available, update status is U3, and a cell is selected, which is known not to be able
         to provide normal service. Only emergency services are offered.

      19.4 NO IMSI

         No valid subscriber data (no SIM/USIM, or the SIM/USIM is not considered valid by the ME), and a cell is
         selected. Only emergency services are offered.

      19.5 NO CELL AVAILABLE

         No cell can be selected. This state is entered after a first intensive search failed (state 19.7). Cells are
         searched at a low rhythm.

      This state is also entered when S1 mode is activated in the MS and current cell is an E-UTRAN cell. No services,
         except those provided by CS fallback and SMS over SGs, are offered.

      19.6 LOCATION UPDATE NEEDED

         Valid subscriber data are available, and for some reason a location updating must be done as soon as possible
         (for instance update status is U1 but the selected cell is not in the registered LA, or the timer has expired).
         This state is usually of no duration, but can last, e.g. due to access class control, (see subclause 4.1.1.2.1).

      19.7 PLMN SEARCH

         The mobile station is searching for PLMNs, and the conditions for state 19.8 are not met. This state is ended
         when either a cell is selected (the new state is 19.1, 19.3 or 19.6), or when it is concluded that no cell is
         available for the moment (the new state is 19.5).

      19.8 PLMN SEARCH, NORMAL SERVICE

         Valid subscriber data are available, update status is U1, a cell is selected which belongs to the LA where the
         subscriber is registered, and the mobile station is searching for PLMNs. This state is ended when either a cell
         is selected (the new state is 19.1, 19.3 or 19.6), or when it is concluded that no cell is available for the
         moment (the new state is 19.5).

      19.9 RECEIVING GROUP CALL (NORMAL SERVICE)

         Only applicable for mobile stations supporting VGCS listening or VBS listening. Valid subscriber data are
         available, update status is U1, a VGCS channel or VBS channel is received in a cell that belongs to the LA
         where the subscriber is registered.

         In this state, only requests from the GCC or BCC layers are treated.

      19.10 RECEIVING GROUP CALL (LIMITED SERVICE)

         Only applicable for mobile stations supporting VGCS listening or VBS listening. Valid subscriber data are
         available, update status is U3, a VGCS channel or VBS channel is received in a cell which is known not to be
         able to provide normal service.

         In this state, only requests from the GCC or BCC layers for the reception of VGCS or VBS calls are treated
         and group call emergency services are offered.

      19.11 eCALL INACTIVE

         Valid subscriber data are available, update status is U4, and a cell is selected, which is expected to be able to
         provide normal service. Only emergency services and test/reconfiguration calls (see 3GPP TS 22.101 [8]) can
         be initiated by the mobile station. This state is applicable only to an eCall only mobile station (as determined
         by information configured in USIM). The state is entered by the mobile station in order to avoid MM activity
         and MM signalling in the absence of an emergency call or test/reconfiguration call. The state is ended when
         an emergency services or test/reconfiguration calls[8] is initiated by the mobile station, the new state depends
         on the result of the procedure when returning to MM-IDLE described in subclause 4.2.3.

4.1.2.2           The update Status
In parallel with the sublayer states described in subclause 4.1.2.1 and which control the MM sublayer protocol, an
update status exists.

The update status pertains to a specific subscriber embodied by a SIM/USIM. This status is defined even when the
subscriber is not activated (SIM/USIM removed or connected to a switched-off ME). It is stored in a non volatile
memory in the SIM/USIM. The update status is changed only as a result of a location updating procedure attempt (with
the exception of an authentication failure and of some cases of CM service rejection). In some cases, the update status is
changed as a result of a GPRS attach, GPRS routing area update, service request network initiated GPRS detach
procedure or due to change in LAI while timer T3246 running.

       U1 UPDATED

          The last location updating attempt was successful (correct procedure outcome, and the answer was
          acceptance from the network). With this status, the SIM/USIM contains also the LAI of the LA where the
          subscriber is registered, and possibly valid TMSI, GSM ciphering key, UMTS integrity key, UMTS ciphering
          key and ciphering key sequence number. Furthermore, if the ME supports any A5 ciphering algorithm that
          requires a 128-bit ciphering key and a USIM is in use, then the ME may contain a valid GSM Kc128. The
          "Location update status" stored on the SIM/USIM shall be "updated".

       U2 NOT UPDATED

          The last location updating attempt made failed procedurally (no significant answer was received from the
          network, including the cases of failures or congestion inside the network).

          For this status, the SIM/USIM can contain a valid LAI of the location area to which the subscriber was
          registered, and possibly also a valid TMSI, GSM ciphering key, UMTS integrity key, UMTS ciphering key
          and ciphering key sequence number. For compatibility reasons, all these fields shall be set to the "deleted"
          value if the LAI is deleted. However the presence of other values shall not be considered an error by the
          mobile station. Furthermore, if the ME supports any A5 ciphering algorithm that requires a 128-bit ciphering
          key and a USIM is in use, then the ME shall delete the GSM Kc128 stored if the LAI is deleted. The "Location
          update status" stored on the SIM/USIM shall be "not updated".

       U3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED

          The last location updating attempt run correctly, but the answer from the network was negative (because of
          roaming or subscription restrictions).

          For this status, the SIM/USIM can contain a valid LAI, TMSI, GSM ciphering key, UMTS integrity key,
          UMTS ciphering key or ciphering key sequence number. For compatibility reasons, all these fields shall be
          set to the "deleted" value if the LAI is deleted. However the presence of other values shall not be considered
          an error by the mobile station. Furthermore, if the ME supports any A5 ciphering algorithm that requires a
          128-bit ciphering key and a USIM is in use, then the ME shall delete the GSM Kc128 stored if the LAI is
          deleted. The "Location update status" stored on the SIM/USIM shall be "Location Area not allowed".

       U4 UPDATING DISABLED

          Location updating has been disabled.

          For this status, the SIM/USIM does not contain any valid LAI, TMSI, GSM ciphering key, UMTS integrity
          key, UMTS ciphering key or ciphering key sequence number. For compatibility reasons, all these fields shall
          be set to the "deleted" value at the moment the status is set to eCALL INACTIVE. However the presence of
          other values shall not be considered an error by the mobile station. Furthermore, if the ME supports any A5
          ciphering algorithm that requires a 128-bit ciphering key and a USIM is in use, then the ME shall delete the
          GSM Kc128 stored at the moment the status is set to eCALL INACTIVE. The "Location update status" stored
          on the SIM/USIM shall be "not updated".

4.1.2.3          MM sublayer states on the network side
       1. IDLE

          The MM sublayer is not active except possibly when the RR sublayer is in Group Receive mode.

      2. WAIT FOR RR CONNECTION

         The MM sublayer has received a request for MM connection establishment from the CM layer. A RR
         connection to the mobile station is requested from the RR sublayer (i.e. paging is performed).

      3. MM CONNECTION ACTIVE

         The MM sublayer has a RR connection to a mobile station. One or more MM connections are active, or no
         MM connection is active but an RRLP procedure or LCS procedure over RRC is ongoing.

      4. IDENTIFICATION INITIATED

         The identification procedure has been started by the network. The timer T3270 is running.

      5. AUTHENTICATION INITIATED

         The authentication procedure has been started by the network. The timer T3260 is running.

      6. TMSI REALLOCATION INITIATED

         The TMSI reallocation procedure has been started by the network. The timer T3250 is running.

      7. SECURITY MODE INITIATED

         In Iu mode, the security mode setting procedure has been requested to the RR sublayer. In A/Gb mode, the
         cipher mode setting procedure has been requested to the RR sublayer.

      8a. WAIT FOR MOBILE ORIGINATED MM CONNECTION

         A CM SERVICE REQUEST message is received and processed, and the MM sublayer awaits the "opening
         message" of the MM connection.

      8b. WAIT FOR NETWORK ORIGINATED MM CONNECTION

         A CM SERVICE PROMPT message has been sent by the network and the MM sublayer awaits the "opening
         message" of the MM connection $(CCBS)$.

      9. WAIT FOR REESTABLISHMENT

         The RR connection to a mobile station with one or more active MM connection has been lost. The network
         awaits a possible re-establishment request from the mobile station.

      10. WAIT OF A GROUP CALL

         Only applicable in case for mobile station supporting VGCS talking. The MM sublayer has received a
         request for establishing a VGCS from the GCC sublayer. The request for establishing a VGCS channels is
         given to the RR sublayer.

      11. GROUP CALL ACTIVE

         Only applicable in case of mobile station supporting VGCS talking. A VGCS channel is established by the
         RR sublayer. An RR connection to the talking mobile station can be established by the RR sublayer on the
         VGCS channel. The MM sublayer is active but no sending of MM message between the network and the
         mobile station has occurred.

      12. MM CONNECTION ACTIVE (GROUP CALL)

4.1.3         GPRS mobility management (GMM) sublayer states
In this subclause, the GMM protocol of the MS and the network are described by means of two different state machines.
In subclause 4.1.3.1, the states of the GMM entity in the MS are introduced. The behaviour of the MS depends on a
GPRS update status that is described in subclause 4.1.3.2. The states for the network side are described in
subclause 4.1.3.3.

4.1.3.1          GMM states in the MS
In this subclause, the possible GMM states are described of a GMM entity in the mobile station. subclause 4.1.3.1.1
summarises the main states of a GMM entity, see figure 4.1b of the present document. The substates that have been
defined are described in subclause 4.1.3.1.2 and subclause 4.1.3.1.3.

However, it should be noted that this subclause does not include a description of the detailed behaviour of the MS in the
single states and does not cover abnormal cases. Thus, figure 4.1b of the present document is rather intended to give an
overview of the state transitions than to be a complete state transition diagram. A detailed description of the behaviour
of the MS is given in subclause 4.2. Especially, with respect to the behaviour of the MS in abnormal cases it is referred
to subclause 4.7.

4.1.3.1.1            Main states

4.1.3.1.1.1              GMM-NULL

The GPRS capability is disabled in the MS. No GPRS mobility management function shall be performed in this state.

4.1.3.1.1.2             GMM-DEREGISTERED

The GPRS capability has been enabled in the MS, but no GMM context has been established. In this state, the MS may
establish a GMM context by starting the GPRS attach or combined GPRS attach procedure.

4.1.3.1.1.3             GMM-REGISTERED-INITIATED

A GPRS attach or combined GPRS attach procedure has been started and the MS is awaiting a response from the
network.

4.1.3.1.1.4             GMM-REGISTERED

A GMM context has been established, i.e. the GPRS attach or combined GPRS attach procedure has been successfully
performed. In this state, the MS may activate PDP contexts, MBMS contexts, may send and receive user data and
signalling information and may reply to a page request. Furthermore, cell and routing area updating are performed.

4.1.3.1.1.5             GMM-DEREGISTERED-INITIATED

The MS has requested release of the GMM context by starting the GPRS detach or combined GPRS detach procedure.
This state is only entered if the MS is not being switched off at detach request.

4.1.3.1.1.6              GMM-ROUTING-AREA-UPDATING-INITIATED

A routing area updating procedure has been started and the MS is awaiting a response from the network.

4.1.3.1.1.7              GMM-SERVICE-REQUEST-INITIATED (Iu mode only)

A service request procedure has been started and the MS is awaiting a response from the network.

4.1.3.1.2            Substates of state GMM-DEREGISTERED
The GMM-DEREGISTERED state is subdivided into several substates as explained below. The substates pertain to the
whole MS (ME alone if no SIM/USIM is inserted, or ME plus SIM/USIM). The selection of the appropriate substate
depends on the GPRS update status, see subclause 4.1.3.2, and on the selected cell.

4.1.3.1.2.1              GMM-DEREGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE

Valid subscriber data is available, a suitable cell has been found and the PLMN or LA is not in the forbidden list. In
this state, a request for GPRS attach is performed using the stored temporary mobile subscriber identity for GPRS (P-
TMSI), routing area identification (RAI) and GPRS ciphering key sequence number in case of GU1. If the GPRS
update status is GU2, the IMSI shall be used to attach for GPRS services.

4.1.3.1.2.2              GMM-DEREGISTERED.LIMITED-SERVICE

Valid subscriber data is available, and a cell is selected, which is known not to be able to provide normal service.

4.1.3.1.2.3              GMM-DEREGISTERED.ATTACH-NEEDED

Valid subscriber data is available and for some reason a GPRS attach must be performed as soon as possible. This state
is usually of no duration, but can last, e.g. due to access class control (see subclause 4.1.1.2.1).

4.1.3.1.2.4              GMM-DEREGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-ATTACH

A cell is selected, a previous GPRS attach was rejected or failed due to a missing response from the network. The
execution of further attach procedures depends on the GPRS attach attempt counter. No GMM procedure except GPRS
attach shall be initiated by the MS in this substate.

4.1.3.1.2.5              GMM-DEREGISTERED.NO-IMSI

No valid subscriber data is available (no SIM/USIM, or the SIM/USIM is not considered valid by the ME) and a cell
has been selected.

4.1.3.1.2.6              GMM-DEREGISTERED.NO-CELL-AVAILABLE

No cell can be selected. This substate is entered after a first intensive search failed (substate PLMN SEARCH). Cells
are searched for at a low rhythm. No services are offered.

4.1.3.1.2.7              GMM-DEREGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH

The mobile station is searching for PLMNs. This substate is left either when a cell has been selected (the new substate
is NORMAL-SERVICE or LIMITED-SERVICE) or when it has been concluded that no cell is available at the moment
(the new substate is NO-CELL-AVAILABLE).

4.1.3.1.2.8              GMM-DEREGISTERED.SUSPENDED (A/Gb mode only)

The MS shall enter this substate when entering dedicated mode and the MS limitations make it unable to communicate
on GPRS channels. The MS shall leave this substate when leaving dedicated mode.

4.1.3.1.3            Substates of state GMM-REGISTERED
The state GMM-REGISTERED is subdivided into several substate as explained below. The substates pertain to the
whole MS (ME alone if no SIM/USIM is inserted, or ME plus SIM/USIM).

4.1.3.1.3.1              GMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE

User data and signalling information may be sent and received.

4.1.3.1.3.2              GMM-REGISTERED.SUSPENDED (A/Gb mode only)

The MS shall enter this substate when entering dedicated mode and when the MS limitations makes it unable to
communicate on GPRS channels. In this substate, no user data should be sent and no signalling information shall be
sent. The MS shall leave this substate when leaving dedicated mode.

4.1.3.1.3.3              GMM-REGISTERED.UPDATE-NEEDED

The MS has to perform a routing area updating procedure, but its access class is not allowed in the cell due to access
class control (see subclause 4.1.1.2.1). The procedure will be initiated as soon as access is granted (this might be due to
a cell-reselection or due to change of the access classes allowed in the current cell). No GMM procedure except routing
area updating shall be initiated by the MS in this substate. In this substate, no user data and no signalling information
shall be sent.

4.1.3.1.3.4              GMM-REGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-UPDATE

A routing area updating procedure failed due to a missing response from the network. The MS retries the procedure
controlled by timers and a GPRS attempt counter. No GMM procedure except routing area updating shall be initiated by
the MS in this substate. No data shall be sent or received.

4.1.3.1.3.5              GMM-REGISTERED.NO-CELL-AVAILABLE

GPRS coverage has been lost or PSM is active in the MS. If PSM is active, the MS can deactivate PSM at any time by
activating the AS layer when the MS needs to send mobile originated signalling or user data. Otherwise, the MS shall
not initiate any GMM procedures except of cell (and PLMN) reselection.

4.1.3.1.3.8              GMM-REGISTERED.IMSI-DETACH-INITIATED

The MS performs a combined GPRS detach procedure for non-GPRS services only (detach type "IMSI Detach"). This
state is entered if the MS is attached for GPRS and non-GPRS services in a network that operates in network mode I
and wants to detach for non-GPRS services only. User data and signalling information may be sent and received.

4.1.3.1.3.9              GMM-REGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH

The mobile station is searching for PLMNs. This substate is left either when a cell has been selected (the new substate
is NORMAL-SERVICE or LIMITED-SERVICE) or when it has been concluded that no cell is available at the moment
(the new substate is NO-CELL-AVAILABLE).

3GPP TS 24.008 version 15.8.0 Release 15                   74                        ETSI TS 124 008 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


4.1.3.2           GPRS update status
In addition to the GMM sublayer states described so far, a GPRS update status exists.

The GPRS update status pertains to a specific subscriber embodied by a SIM/USIM. This status is defined even when
the subscriber is not activated (SIM/USIM removed or connected to a switched off ME). It is stored in a non volatile
memory in the SIM/USIM. The GPRS update status is changed only after execution of a GPRS attach, combined GPRS
attach, network initiated GPRS detach, authentication, service request, paging for GPRS services using IMSI, routing
area updating, combined routing area updating procedure or due to change in RAI while timer T3346 running.

   GU1: UPDATED

       The last GPRS attach or routing area updating attempt was successful (correct procedure outcome, and the
       answer was accepted by the network). The SIM/USIM contains the RAI of the routing area (RA) to which the
       subscriber was attached, and possibly a valid P-TMSI, GPRS GSM ciphering key, GPRS UMTS ciphering key,
       GPRS UMTS integrity key and GPRS ciphering key sequence number. Furthermore, if the ME supports any
       GEA ciphering algorithm that requires a 128-bit ciphering key and a USIM is in use, then the ME may contain a
       valid GPRS GSM Kc128. Furthermore, if the ME supports any GIA integrity algorithm that requires a 128-bit
       integrity key and a USIM is in use, then the ME may contain a valid GPRS GSM Kint.

   GU2: NOT UPDATED

       The last GPRS attach or routing area updating attempt failed procedurally, e.g. no response was received from
       the network. This includes the cases of failures or congestion inside the network.

       In this case, the SIM/USIM can contain the RAI of the routing area (RA) to which the subscriber was attached,
       and possibly also a valid P-TMSI, GPRS GSM ciphering key, GPRS UMTS ciphering key, GPRS UMTS
       integrity key and GPRS ciphering key sequence number. For compatibility reasons, all these fields shall be set to
       the "deleted" value if the RAI is deleted. However, the presence of other values shall not be considered an error
       by the MS. Furthermore, if the ME supports any GEA ciphering algorithm that requires a 128-bit ciphering key
       and a USIM is in use, then the ME shall delete the GPRS GSM Kc128 stored if the RAI is deleted. Furthermore, if
       the ME supports any GIA integrity algorithm that requires a 128-bit integrity key and a USIM is in use, then the
       ME shall delete the GPRS GSM Kint stored if the RAI is deleted.

   GU3: ROAMING NOT ALLOWED

       The last GPRS attach or routing area updating attempt was correctly performed, but the answer from the network
       was negative (because of roaming or subscription restrictions).

       In this case, the SIM/USIM can contain the RAI of the routing area (RA) to which the subscriber was attached,
       and possibly also a valid P-TMSI, GPRS GSM ciphering key, GPRS UMTS ciphering key, GPRS UMTS
       integrity key or GPRS ciphering key sequence number. For compatibility reasons, all these fields shall be set to
       the value "deleted" if the RAI is deleted. However, the presence of other values shall not be considered an error
       by the MS. Furthermore, if the ME supports any GEA ciphering algorithm that requires a 128-bit ciphering key
       and a USIM is in use, then the ME shall delete the GPRS GSM Kc128 stored if the RAI is deleted. Furthermore, if
       the ME supports any GIA integrity algorithm that requires a 128-bit integrity key and a USIM is in use, then the
       ME shall delete the GPRS GSM Kint stored if the RAI is deleted.

If the MS is attached for emergency bearer services, the MS shall not store the GMM parameters described in this
subclause on the SIM/USIM or in non-volatile memory. Instead the MS shall temporarily store these parameters locally
in the ME and the MS shall delete these parameters when the MS is detached.

4.1.3.3           GMM mobility management states on the network side
In this subsubclause, the possible states are described for the GMM on the network side. Subclause 4.1.3.3.1
summarises the main states. The corresponding substates are described in subclause 4.1.3.3.2.

However, it should be noted that this subclause does not include a description of the detailed behaviour of the network
in the single states and does not cover abnormal cases. Thus, figure 4.1c/3GPP TS 24.008 is rather intended to give an
overview of the state transitions than to be a complete state transition diagram. A detailed description of the behaviour
of the MS is given in subclause 4.2. Especially, with respect to the behaviour of the MS in abnormal cases it is referred
to subclause 4.7.

4.2           Behaviour of the MS in MM Idle state, GMM-
              DEREGISTERED state and GMM-REGISTERED state
In this subclause, the detailed behaviour of the MS in the main states MM IDLE, GMM-DEREGISTERED and GMM-
REGISTERED is described. Subclauses 4.2.1 to 4.2.3 refer to the state MM IDLE, whereas subclauses 4.2.4 and 4.2.5
refer to the states GMM-DEREGISTERED and GMM-REGISTERED, respectively.

The MM IDLE state is entered when none of the MM procedures are running and no RR connection exists. It is left
when one of the MM procedures are triggered or a RR connection is established.

The specific behaviour in the MM IDLE state depends on the service state of the mobile station as described in
subclause 4.1.2.1.2. The service state depends in particular on the update status which is defined in subclause 4.1.2.2.

How an appropriate service state is chosen after power on is described in subclause 4.2.1, and the specific behaviour of
the mobile station in MM IDLE state is described in subclause 4.2.2. The service state chosen when the MM IDLE state
is returned to from any state except NULL state is described in subclause 4.2.3.

It should be noted that transitions between the various MM idle states are caused by (e.g.):

   -   results of procedures on RR connected mode (see subclause 4.2.3);

   -   insertion or removal of the SIM/USIM;

   -   cell selection/reselection (see also 3GPP TS 43.022 [82] and 3GPP TS 25.304 [98]);

   -   PLMN search;

   -   loss of coverage.

How various MM procedures affects the service state and the update status is described in the detailed descriptions of
the procedures in subclauses 4.3 to 4.5.


4.2.1         Primary Service State selection

4.2.1.1           Selection of the Service State after Power On.
For an eCall only mobile station (as determined by information configured in the USIM), Timers T3242 and T3243 are
considered to have expired at power-on. When mobility management is activated after power-on, the service state is
19.7 PLMN SEARCH. The detailed processing in this state is described in detail in 3GPP TS 23.122 [14],
3GPP TS 43.022 [82], 3GPP TS 45.008 [34] and 3GPP TS 25.304 [98], where procedures for power on and selection of
PLMN is described in detail. If the "Location update status" stored on the SIM/USIM is different from "updated", then
the mobile shall act as if the "Location update status" stored on the SIM/USIM is "not updated".

The service state when the PLMN SEARCH state is left depends on the outcome of the search and on the presence of
the SIM/USIM:

   -   if no cell has been found, the state is NO CELL AVAILABLE, until a cell is found;

   -   if no SIM/USIM is present the state is NO IMSI;

   -   for an eCall only mobile station (as determined by information configured in USIM), the state is eCALL
       INACTIVE.

   -   if the mobile station has been continuously activated since loosing coverage and then returns to coverage, and if
       the selected cell is in the location area where the mobile station is registered and the timer T3212 has not
       expired, then the state is NORMAL SERVICE;

   -   if the selected cell is in the location area where the mobile station is registered and IMSI ATTACH is not
       required and timer T3212 has not expired, then the state is NORMAL SERVICE;



                                                           ETSI
3GPP TS 24.008 version 15.8.0 Release 15                    77                       ETSI TS 124 008 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


   -   if the mobile station is in automatic network selection mode and the selected cell is in a forbidden PLMN, is in a
       forbidden LA, or is a CSG cell whose CSG ID and associated PLMN identity are not in the Allowed CSG list or
       in the Operator CSG list stored in the MS, then the mobile station enters the LIMITED SERVICE state;

   -   if the mobile station is in manual network selection mode and no cell of the selected PLMN has been found, or
       the cell that is found in the selected PLMN is a CSG cell whose CSG ID and associated PLMN identity are not
       in the Allowed CSG list or in the Operator CSG list stored in the MS, then the mobile station enters the
       LIMITED SERVICE state;

   -   otherwise, the mobile station enters the LOCATION UPDATE NEEDED state.

4.2.1.2          Other Cases
The state PLMN SEARCH is also entered in the following cases:

   -   in state NO IMSI, a SIM/USIM is inserted;

   -   in any state except NO IMSI, NO CELL AVAILABLE, NORMAL SERVICE and RECEIVING GROUP CALL
       (NORMAL SERVICE) after the user has asked for a PLMN selection;

   -   in any state except NO IMSI and NO CELL AVAILABLE, coverage is lost;

   -   roaming is denied;

   -   optionally, when the mobile station is in the ATTEMPTING TO UPDATE state and is in Automatic Network
       Selection mode and location update attempt counter is greater than or equal to 4.

The service state when the PLMN SEARCH is left depends on the outcome of the search and on the presence of the
SIM/USIM as specified in subclause 4.2.1.1.


4.2.2         Detailed Description of the MS behaviour in MM IDLE State.
In the MM IDLE state the mobile station shall behave according to the service state. In the following subclauses the
behaviour is described for the non transient service states. It should be noted that after procedures in RR connected
mode, e.g. location updating procedures, subclause 4.2.3 applies which specifies the selection of the MM idle state.
Furthermore when in sub-state NORMAL SERVICE, if a PLMN selection is requested, the MS enters sub-state
SEARCH FOR PLMN, NORMAL SERVICE.

4.2.2.1          Service State, NORMAL SERVICE
When in state MM IDLE and service state NORMAL SERVICE, the mobile station shall:

   -   provided that T3246 is not running, perform normal location updating when a new location area is entered;

   -   perform location updating procedure at expiry of timer T3211 or T3213;

   -   perform periodic updating at expiration of timer T3212;

   -   perform IMSI detach;

   -   provided that T3246 is not running, support requests from the CM layer;

   -   support request for emergency calls;

   -   respond to paging; and

   -   for an eCall only mobile station (as determined by information configured in USIM), perform the eCall inactivity
       procedure at expiry of timer T3242 or timer T3243.

In addition, mobile stations supporting VGCS listening or VBS listening shall:

   -   indicate notifications to the GCC or BCC sublayer;

   -   respond to notification if the GCC or BCC sublayer requests the reception of a voice group or broadcast call for
       which no channel description has been received in the notification by the RR sublayer;

   -   request the RR sublayer to receive a voice group or broadcast call if the GCC or BCC sublayer requests the
       reception of a voice group or broadcast call for which a channel description has been received in the notification
       by the RR sublayer and then go to the service state RECEIVING GROUP CALL (NORMAL SERVICE).

       T3246 is not running;

   -   if entry into this state was caused by c) or d) or f) (with cause different from "abnormal release, unspecified") or
       g) (with cause "retry upon entry into a new cell") of subclause 4.4.4.9, then location updating shall be performed
       when a new cell is entered;

   -   if entry into this state was caused by e) or f) (with cause "abnormal release, unspecified"), g) (with cause
       different from "retry upon entry into a new cell"), i) or j) of subclause 4.4.4.9, then location updating shall not be
       performed because a new cell is entered;

   -   perform normal location updating at expiry of timer T3212;

   -   not perform IMSI detach unless timer T3246 is running and the location area of the current cell is same as the

4.2.2.9           Service State, eCALL INACTIVE
When in state MM IDLE and service state eCALL INACTIVE, the mobile station shall:

   -   not perform periodic updating;

   -   not perform IMSI detach;

   -   reject any requests from CM entities for MM connections except for emergency calls and calls to a non-
       emergency MSISDN for test and terminal reconfiguration services;

   -   not perform normal location updating; and

   -   not respond to paging.


4.2.3         Service state when back to state MM IDLE from another state
When returning to MM IDLE, e.g., after a location updating procedure, the mobile station selects the cell as specified in
3GPP TS 43.022 [82] and 3GPP TS 25.304 [98]. With one exception, this is a normal cell selection.

An eCall only mobile station (as determined by information configured in USIM), shall start timer T3242 if the return
to MM IDLE state is the result of an emergency services call and shall start timer T3243 if the return to MM IDLE state
is the result of a call to a non-emergency MSISDN for test and terminal reconfiguration services, as described in
subclause 4.4.7.

If this return to idle state is not subsequent to a location updating procedure terminated with reception of cause
"Roaming not allowed in this location area", the service state depends on the result of the cell selection procedure, on
the update status of the mobile station, on the location data stored in the mobile station and on the presence of the
SIM/USIM:

   -   if no cell has been found, the state is NO CELL AVAILABLE, until a cell is found;

   -   if no SIM/USIM is present, or if the inserted SIM/USIM is considered invalid by the MS, the state is NO IMSI;

   -   for an eCall only mobile station (as determined by information configured in USIM), if timer T3242 or timer
       T3243 has expired and service state PLMN SEARCH is not required, the state is eCALL INACTIVE and the
       eCall inactivity procedure is performed as described in subclause 4.4.7;

   -   if the selected cell is in the location area where the MS is registered, then the state is NORMAL SERVICE; it
       shall be noted that this also includes an abnormal case described in subclause 4.4.4.9;

   -   (Only applicable for mobile stations supporting VGCS listening or VBS listening.) if the mobile stations was in
       the service state RECEIVING GROUP CALL (NORMAL SERVICE) or RECEIVING GROUP CALL
       (LIMITED SERVICE) before the location updating procedure and the selected cell is in the location area where
       the mobile station is registered, then the state is RECEIVING GROUP CALL (NORMAL SERVICE);

   -   if the selected cell is in a location area where the mobile station is not registered but in which the MS is allowed
       to attempt a location update, then the state is LOCATION UPDATE NEEDED;

   -   if the selected cell is in a location area where the mobile station is not allowed to attempt a location update, then
       the state is LIMITED SERVICE;

   -   if the selected cell is a CSG cell whose CSG ID and associated PLMN identity are not in the Allowed CSG list
       or in the Operator CSG list stored in the MS, then the state is LIMITED SERVICE;

   -   (Only applicable for MSs supporting VGCS listening or VBS listening.) if the MSs was in the service state
       RECEIVING GROUP CALL (NORMAL SERVICE) or RECEIVING GROUP CALL (LIMITED SERVICE)
       before the location updating procedure and the selected cell is in the location area where the MS is not allowed
       to attempt a location update, then the state is RECEIVING GROUP CALL (LIMITED SERVICE);

   -   after some abnormal cases occurring during an unsuccessful location updating procedure, as described in
       subclause 4.4.4.9, the state is ATTEMPTING TO UPDATE.

In case of a return from a location updating procedure to which was answered "Roaming not allowed in this location
area", the service state PLMN SEARCH is entered as specified in subclause 4.2.1.2.


4.2.4         Behaviour in state GMM-DEREGISTERED
The state GMM-DEREGISTERED is entered when:

   -   the MS is switched on;

   -   the GPRS capability has been enabled in the MS;

   -   a GPRS detach or combined GPRS detach procedure has been performed;

   -   a GMM procedure has failed (except routing area updating, see subclause 4.7.5); or

   -   the MS attached for emergency bearer services is in PMM-IDLE mode and its periodic routing area update timer
       expires (see subclause 4.7.2.2).

The selection of the appropriate substate of GMM-DEREGISTERED after switching on is described in
subclause 4.2.4.1. The specific behaviour of the MS in state GMM-DEREGISTERED is described in subclause 4.2.4.2.
The substate chosen when the GMM-DEREGISTERED state is returned to from another state except state GMM-
NULL is described in subclause 4.2.4.3.

It should be noted that transitions between the various substates of GMM-DEREGISTERED are caused by (e.g.):

   -   insertion or removal of the SIM/USIM;

   -   cell selection/reselection (see also 3GPP TS 43.022 [82] and 3GPP TS 25.304 [98]);

   -   PLMN search;

   -   loss/regain of coverage; or

   -   change of RA.

How various GMM procedures affect the GMM-DEREGISTERED substates and the GPRS update status is described
in the detailed description of the GMM procedures in subclause 4.7.

4.2.4.1          Primary substate selection

4.2.4.1.1            Selection of the substate after power on or enabling the MS's GPRS capability
When the MS is switched on, the substate shall be PLMN-SEARCH in case the SIM/USIM is inserted and valid. See
3GPP TS 23.122 [14] and 3GPP TS 45.008 [34] for further details.

When the GPRS capability in an activated MS has been enabled, the selection of the GMM-DEREGISTERED substate
depends on the MM state and the GPRS update status.

The substate chosen after PLMN-SEARCH, in case of power on or after enabling of the GPRS capability is:

   -   if the cell is not supporting GPRS, the substate shall be NO-CELL-AVAILABLE;

   -   if no SIM/USIM is present the substate shall be NO-IMSI;

   -   if a suitable cell supporting GPRS has been found and the PLMN or LA is not in the forbidden list, then the
       substate shall be NORMAL-SERVICE;




                                                          ETSI
3GPP TS 24.008 version 15.8.0 Release 15                    83                        ETSI TS 124 008 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


   -   if the selected cell supporting GPRS is in a forbidden PLMN, is in a forbidden LA, or is a CSG cell with a CSG
       ID and associated PLMN identity that are not in Allowed CSG list or in the Operator CSG list stored in the MS ,
       then the MS shall enter the substate LIMITED-SERVICE;

   -   if the MS is in manual network selection mode and no cell supporting GPRS of the selected PLMN has been
       found, the MS shall enter the substate NO-CELL-AVAILABLE.

4.2.4.1.2            Other Cases
When the MM state is IDLE, the GMM substate PLMN-SEARCH shall also be entered in the following cases:

   -   when a SIM/USIM is inserted in substate NO-IMSI;

   -   when the user has asked for a PLMN selection in any substate except NO IMSI and NO CELL AVAILABLE ;

   -   when coverage is lost in any substate except NO IMSI and NO CELL AVAILABLE ;

   -   Roaming is denied;

   -   optionally, when the MS is in automatic network selection mode and the maximum allowed number of
       consecutive unsuccessful attach attempts controlled by the GPRS attach attempt counter (subclause 4.7.3) have
       been performed.

4.2.4.2          Detailed description of the MS behaviour in state GMM-DEREGISTERED
In state GMM-DEREGISTERED, the MS shall behave according to the substate. In the following subclauses, the
behaviour is described for the non transient substates.

4.2.4.2.1            Substate, NORMAL-SERVICE
The MS shall:

   -   initiate GPRS attach.

4.2.4.2.2            Substate, ATTEMPTING-TO-ATTACH
The MS:

   -   shall initiate GPRS attach on the expiry of timers T3311, T3302, or T3346;

   -   shall initiate GPRS attach when entering a new PLMN, if timer T3346 is running and the new PLMN is not
       equivalent to the PLMN where the MS started timer T3346, the PLMN identity of the new cell is not in one of
       the forbidden PLMN lists and the location area this cell is belonging to is not in one of the lists of forbidden
       LAs;

   -   may initiate GPRS attach for emergency bearer services (UTRAN Iu mode only) even if timer T3346 is running;

   -   shall initiate GPRS attach when the routing area of the serving cell has changed, if timer T3346 is not running,
       the PLMN identity of the new cell is not in one of the forbidden PLMN lists and the location area this cell is
       belonging to is not in one of the lists of forbidden LAs;

   -   shall if entry into this state was caused by b) or d) with cause "Retry upon entry into a new cell" of
       subclause 4.7.3.1.5, perform GPRS attach when a new cell is entered;

   -   shall if entry into this state was caused by c) or d) with cause different from "Retry upon entry into a new cell" of
       subclause 4.7.3.1.5, not perform GPRS attach when a new cell is entered;

   -   shall use requests for non-GPRS services from CM layers to trigger the combined GPRS attach procedure, if
       timer T3346 is not running and the network operates in network operation mode I. Depending on which of the
       timers T3311 or T3302 is running the MS shall stop the relevant timer and act as if the stopped timer has
       expired; and

   -   may initiate GPRS attach upon request of the upper layers to establish a PDN connection for emergency bearer
       services (UTRAN Iu mode only), if timer T3346 is not running.

       appropriate substate.

4.2.4.2.6            Substate, PLMN-SEARCH
The MS shall perform PLMN selection. If a new PLMN is selected, the MS shall reset the GPRS attach attempt counter
and initiate the GPRS attach procedure (see subclause 4.7.3.1).

If the selected cell is known not to be able to provide normal service, the MS may initiate GPRS attach for emergency
bearer services (UTRAN Iu mode only).

4.2.4.2.7            Substate, ATTACH-NEEDED
The MS shall start a GPRS attach procedure if still needed as soon as the access class control allows network contact in
the selected cell.

The MS may initiate GPRS attach for emergency bearer services (UTRAN Iu mode only).

4.2.4.2.8            Substate, SUSPENDED (A/Gb mode only)
The MS:

   -   shall not send any user data; and

   -   shall not send any signalling information.

4.2.4.3          Substate when back to state GMM-DEREGISTERED from another GMM
                 state
When returning to state GMM-DEREGISTERED, the MS shall select a cell as specified in 3GPP TS 43.022 [82] and
3GPP TS 25.304 [98].

The substate depends on the result of the cell selection procedure, the outcome of the previously performed GMM
specific procedures, on the GPRS update status of the MS, on the location area data stored in the MS and on the
presence of the SIM/USIM:

   -   if no cell has been found, the substate is NO-CELL-AVAILABLE, until a cell is found;

   -   if a suitable cell supporting GPRS has been found and the PLMN or LA is not in the forbidden list, the substate
       shall be NORMAL-SERVICE;

   -   if a GPRS attach shall be performed (e.g. network requested reattach), the substate shall be ATTEMPTING-TO-
       ATTACH;

   -   if a PLMN reselection (according to 3GPP TS 23.122 [14]) is needed, the substate shall be PLMN SEARCH;

   -   if the selected cell is known not to be able to provide normal service, the substate shall be LIMITED-SERVICE.


4.2.5         Behaviour in state GMM-REGISTERED
The state GMM-REGISTERED is entered when:

   -   a GMM context is established, i.e. the MS is IMSI attached for GPRS services only or for GPRS and non-GPRS
       services.

The specific behaviour of the MS in state GMM-REGISTERED is described in subclause 4.2.5.1. The primary substate
when entering the state GMM-REGISTERED is always NORMAL-SERVICE.

It should be noted that transitions between the various substates of GMM-REGISTERED are caused by (e.g.):

   -   cell selection/reselection (see also 3GPP TS 43.022 [82] and 3GPP TS 25.304 [98]);

   -   change of RA;

   -   loss/regain of coverage.

How various GMM procedures affect the GMM-REGISTERED substates is described in the detailed description of the
procedures in subclause 4.7.

4.2.5.1          Detailed description of the MS behaviour in state GMM-REGISTERED

       the serving cell has changed and the location area this cell is belonging to is not in the list of forbidden LAs.

GPRS MSs in operation modes C or A shall answer to paging requests.

GPRS MS in operation mode B may answer to paging requests.

4.2.5.1.8            Substate, PLMN-SEARCH
When the MM state is IDLE, the GMM substate PLMN-SEARCH may be entered if the MS is in automatic network
selection mode and the maximum allowed number of consecutive unsuccessful routing area update attempts controlled
by the GPRS routing area updating attempt counter (subclause 4.7.5) have been performed. If a new PLMN is selected,
the MS shall reset the routing area updating attempt counter and perform the routing area updating procedure.

If the selected cell is known not to be able to provide normal service, the MS may initiate GPRS attach for emergency
bearer services (UTRAN Iu mode only).


4.3             MM common procedures
As described in subclause 4.1.1, a MM common procedure can be initiated at any time whilst a RR connection exists
between the network and the mobile station.


4.3.1           TMSI reallocation procedure

4.3.1.0           General
The purpose of the TMSI reallocation procedure is to provide identity confidentiality, i.e. to protect a user against being
identified and located by an intruder (see 3GPP TS 42.009 [5], 3GPP TS 43.020 [13] and 3GPP TS 33.102 [5a]).

If the identity confidentiality service is applied for an IMSI, a Temporary Mobile Subscriber Identity (TMSI) is used for
identification within the radio interface signalling procedures.

In a network supporting the feature 'Intra domain connection of RAN nodes to multiple CN nodes' a TMSI shall be
allocated to each IMSI attached mobile station. See 3GPP TS 23.236 [94], subclause 4.3.

The structure of the TMSI is specified in 3GPP TS 23.003 [10]. The TMSI has significance only within a location area.
Outside the location area it has to be combined with the Location Area Identifier (LAI) to provide for an unambiguous
identity.

Usually the TMSI reallocation is performed at least at each change of a location area. (Such choices are left to the
network operator).




                                                           ETSI
3GPP TS 24.008 version 15.8.0 Release 15                    88                         ETSI TS 124 008 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


The reallocation of a TMSI can be performed either by a unique procedure defined in this subclause or implicitly by a
location updating procedure using the TMSI. The implicit reallocation of a TMSI is described together with that
procedure.

If a TMSI provided by a mobile station is unknown in the network e.g. due to a data base failure, the network may
require the mobile station to provide its International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI). In this case the identification
procedure (see subclause 4.3.3) should be used before the TMSI reallocation procedure may be initiated.

The TMSI reallocation can be initiated by the network at any time whilst a RR connection exists between the network
and the mobile station.

   NOTE 1: Usually the TMSI reallocation is performed in ciphered mode.

   NOTE 2: Normally the TMSI reallocation will take place in conjunction with another procedure, e.g. at location
           updating or at call setup (see 3GPP TS 29.002 [37]).

   NOTE 3: The explicit TMSI reallocation procedure is started by the network only if the mobile station is updated in
           the current location area or if a location updating procedure is ongoing for that particular mobile station,
           or if the network wishes to send a non-broadcast LAI according to 3GPP TS 23.236 [94] to the mobile
           station.

4.3.1.1           TMSI reallocation initiation by the network
The network initiates the TMSI reallocation procedure by sending a TMSI REALLOCATION COMMAND message to
the mobile station and starts the timer T3250.

The TMSI REALLOCATION COMMAND message contains a new combination of TMSI and LAI allocated by the
network or a LAI and the IMSI if the used TMSI shall be deleted. Usually the TMSI-REALLOCATION COMMAND
message is sent to the mobile station using a RR connection in ciphered mode (see 3GPP TS 43.020 [13] and
3GPP TS 33.102 [5a]).

4.3.1.2           TMSI reallocation completion by the mobile station
Upon receipt of the TMSI REALLOCATION COMMAND message the mobile station:

   a) shall stores the Location Area Identifier (LAI) in the SIM/USIM;

   b) shall enter the sub-state NORMAL SERVICE if the MS is in the sub-state ATTEMPTING TO UPDATE;

   c) if the received identity is the IMSI of the relevant mobile station, shall delete any TMSI;

   d) if the received identity is a TMSI, shall store the TMSI in the SIM/USIM; and

   e) shall send a TMSI REALLOCATION COMPLETE message to the network.

4.3.1.3           TMSI reallocation completion in the network.
Upon receipt of the TMSI REALLOCATION COMPLETE message, the network stops the timer T3250 and either
considers the new TMSI as valid or, if an IMSI was sent to the mobile station, considers the old TMSI as deleted.

If the RR connection is no more needed, then the network will request the RR sublayer to release it (see
3GPP TS 44.018 [84] subclause 3.5 and 3GPP TS 25.331 [23c]).

4.3.1.4           Abnormal cases in the mobile station
The following abnormal cases can be identified:

   a) RR connection failure:

       The mobile station shall consider the new TMSI and new LAI, if any, as valid and the old TMSI and old LAI as
       deleted as soon as a TMSI REALLOCATION COMMAND message or another message containing a new
       TMSI (e.g. LOCATION UPDATING ACCEPT message) is correctly received. Any RR connection failure at a
       later stage shall not have any impact on the TMSI and LAI storage.

4.3.1.5          Abnormal cases on the network side
The following abnormal cases can be identified:

   a) RR connection failure:

      If the RR connection is lost before the TMSI REALLOCATION COMPLETE message is received, the network
      shall release all MM connections, if any. Furthermore, the network should consider both the old and the new
      TMSI as occupied for a certain recovery time.

   During this period the network:

      -   may use the IMSI for paging or network originated transactions on the CM layer. Upon response from the
          mobile station the TMSI reallocation procedure shall be restarted;

      -   may consider the new TMSI as valid if it is used by the mobile station; or

      -   may use the identification procedure followed by a new TMSI reallocation procedure, if the mobile station
          uses the old TMSI (see subclause 4.3.3).

      Other implementations are possible, e.g. the network may page with the old TMSI.

   b) Expiry of timer T3250:

      The TMSI reallocation procedure is supervised by the timer T3250 (see example in figure 4.1). At expiry of
      timer T3250 the network may release the RR connection. In this case, the network shall abort the reallocation
      procedure release all MM connections if any, and follow the rules for the case a as described above.

4.3.2        Authentication procedure

4.3.2a           Authentication procedure used for a UMTS authentication challenge
The purpose of the authentication procedure is fourfold (see 3GPP TS 33.102 [5a]):

      First to permit the network to check whether the identity provided by the mobile station is acceptable or not;

      Second to provide parameters enabling the mobile station to calculate a new UMTS ciphering key;

      Third to provide parameters enabling the mobile station to calculate a new UMTS integrity key;

      Fourth to permit the mobile station to authenticate the network.

The cases where the authentication procedure should be used are defined in 3GPP TS 33.102 [5a].

The UMTS authentication procedure is always initiated and controlled by the network. However, there is the possibility
for the MS to reject the UMTS authentication challenge sent by the network.

The MS shall support the UMTS authentication challenge, if a USIM is inserted.

A UMTS security context is established in the MS and the network when a UMTS authentication challenge is
performed in A/Gb mode or in Iu mode. After a successful UMTS authentication, the UMTS ciphering key, the UMTS
integrity key, the GSM ciphering key and the ciphering key sequence number, are stored both in the network and the
MS. Furthermore, in A/Gb mode both the ME and the network may derive and store a GSM Kc128 as part of the UMTS
security context as described in the subclause 4.3.2.3a.

3GPP TS 24.008 version 15.8.0 Release 15                   90                        ETSI TS 124 008 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


4.3.2b           Authentication Procedure used for a GSM authentication challenge
The purpose of the authentication procedure is twofold (see 3GPP TS 43.020 [13]):

       First to permit the network to check whether the identity provided by the mobile station is acceptable or not;

       Second to provide parameters enabling the mobile station to calculate a new GSM ciphering key.

The cases where the authentication procedure should be used are defined in 3GPP TS 42.009 [5].

The authentication procedure is always initiated and controlled by the network. GSM authentication challenge shall be
supported by a ME supporting GERAN or UTRAN.

A GSM security context is established in the MS and the network when a GSM authentication challenge is performed in
A/Gb mode or in Iu mode. However, in Iu mode the MS shall not accept a GSM authentication challenge, if a USIM is
inserted. After a successful GSM authentication, the GSM ciphering key and the ciphering key sequence number, are
stored both in the network and the MS.

4.3.2.1          Authentication request by the network
The network initiates the authentication procedure by transferring an AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message across
the radio interface and starts the timer T3260. The AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message contains the parameters
necessary to calculate the response parameters (see 3GPP TS 43.020 [13] (in case of GSM authentication challenge)
and 3GPP TS 33.102 [5a] (in case of an UMTS authentication challenge)).

In a GSM authentication challenge, the AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message also contains the GSM ciphering key
sequence number allocated to the key which may be computed from the given parameters.

In a UMTS authentication challenge, the AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message also contains the ciphering key
sequence number allocated to the key set of UMTS ciphering key, UMTS integrity key and GSM ciphering key which
may be computed from the given parameters. Furthermore, the ciphering key sequence number is also linked to a GSM
Kc128 if after the authentication procedure the network in A/Gb mode selects an A5 ciphering algorithm that requires a
128-bit ciphering key.

4.3.2.2          Authentication response by the mobile station
The mobile station shall be ready to respond upon an AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message at any time whilst a
RR connection exists. With exception of the cases described in subclause 4.3.2.5.1, it shall process the challenge
information and send back an AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message to the network.

If a SIM is inserted in the MS, the MS shall ignore the Authentication Parameter AUTN IE if included in the
AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message and shall proceed as in case of a GSM authentication challenge. It shall not
perform the authentication of the network described in subclause 4.3.2.5.1.

In a GSM authentication challenge, the new GSM ciphering key calculated from the challenge information shall
overwrite the previous GSM ciphering key and any previously stored UMTS ciphering key and UMTS integrity key
shall be deleted. The new GSM ciphering key shall be stored on the SIM/USIM together with the ciphering key
sequence number.

In a UMTS authentication challenge, the new UMTS ciphering key, the new GSM ciphering key and the new UMTS
integrity key calculated from the challenge information shall overwrite the previous UMTS ciphering key, GSM
ciphering key and UMTS integrity key. The new UMTS ciphering key, GSM ciphering key and UMTS integrity key are
stored on the USIM together with the ciphering key sequence number. Furthermore, in A/Gb mode when after the
authentication procedure an A5 ciphering algorithm that requires a 128-bit ciphering key is taken into use, then a new
GSM Kc128 shall also be calculated as described in the subclause 4.3.2.3a.

The SIM/USIM will provide the mobile station with the authentication response, based upon the authentication
challenge given from the ME. A UMTS authentication challenge will result in the USIM passing a RES to the ME. A
GSM authentication challenge will result in the SIM/USIM passing a SRES to the ME.

A ME supporting UMTS authentication challenge may support the following procedure:

In order to avoid a synchronisation failure, when the mobile station receives an AUTHENTICATION REQUEST
message, the mobile station shall store the received RAND together with the RES returned from the USIM in the

3GPP TS 24.008 version 15.8.0 Release 15                    91                        ETSI TS 124 008 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


volatile memory and associate it with CS domain. When the MS receives a subsequent AUTHENTICATION
REQUEST message, if the stored RAND value for the CS domain is equal to the new received value in the
AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message, then the mobile station shall not pass the RAND to the USIM, but shall
immediately send the AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message with the stored RES for the CS domain. If, for the CS
domain, there is no valid stored RAND in the mobile station or the stored RAND is different from the new received
value in the AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message, the mobile station shall pass the RAND to the USIM, shall
override any previously stored RAND and RES with the new ones and start, or reset and restart timer T3218.

The RAND and RES values stored in the mobile station shall be deleted and timer T3218, if running, shall be stopped:

   -   upon receipt of a SECURITY MODE COMMAND (Iu mode only),
          CIPHERING MODE COMMAND (A/Gb mode only),
          CM_SERVICE_ACCEPT,
          CM_SERVICE_REJECT,
          LOCATION_UPDATING_ACCEPT
          or AUTHENTICATION REJECT message;

   -   upon expiry of timer T3218; or

   -   if the mobile station enters the MM state MM IDLE or NULL.

4.3.2.3           Authentication processing in the network
Upon receipt of the AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message, the network stops the timer T3260 and checks the
validity of the response (see 3GPP TS 43.020 [13] in case of a GSM authentication challenge respective
3GPP TS 33.102 [5a] in case of an UMTS authentication challenge).

Upon receipt of the AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message, the network stops the timer T3260. In Synch failure
case, the core network may renegotiate with the HLR/AuC and provide the MS with new authentication parameters.

4.3.2.3a          128-bit circuit-switched GSM ciphering key
The ME and the network may derive and store a 128-bit circuit-switched GSM ciphering key or GSM Kc128 from an
established UMTS security context. If the GSM Kc128 exists, then it is also part of the UMTS security context.

The ME with a USIM in use shall compute a new GSM Kc128 using the UMTS ciphering key and the UMTS integrity
key from an established UMTS security context as specified in 3GPP TS 33.102 [5a]. The new GSM Kc128 shall be
stored only in the ME. The ME shall overwrite the existing GSM Kc128 with the new GSM Kc128. The ME shall delete
the GSM Kc128 at switch off, when the USIM is disabled as well as under the conditions identified in the
subclause 4.1.2.2 and 4.3.2.4. The ME with a USIM in use shall apply the GSM Kc128 when in A/Gb mode an A5
ciphering algorithm that requires a 128-bit ciphering key is taken into use.

The network shall compute the GSM Kc128 using the UMTS integrity key and the UMTS ciphering key from an
established UMTS security context as specified in 3GPP TS 33.102 [5a] only when in A/Gb mode an A5 ciphering
algorithm that requires a 128-bit ciphering key is to be used.

4.3.2.4           Ciphering key sequence number
The security parameters for authentication and ciphering are tied together in sets.

In a GSM authentication challenge, from a challenge parameter RAND both the authentication response parameter
SRES and the GSM ciphering key can be computed given the secret key associated to the IMSI.

In a UMTS authentication challenge, from a challenge parameter RAND, the authentication response parameter RES
and the UMTS ciphering key and the UMTS integrity key can be computed given the secret key associated to the IMSI.
In addition, in the USIM a GSM ciphering key can be computed from the UMTS ciphering key and the UMTS integrity
key by means of an unkeyed conversion function. Furthermore, in A/Gb mode if an A5 ciphering algorithm that
requires a 128-bit ciphering key is taken into use, then a GSM Kc128 shall also be calculated as described in the
subclause 4.3.2.3a.

In order to allow start of ciphering on a RR connection without authentication, the ciphering key sequence numbers are
introduced. The ciphering key sequence number is managed by the network in the way that the AUTHENTICATION
REQUEST message contains the ciphering key sequence number allocated to the GSM ciphering key (in case of a GSM



                                                           ETSI
3GPP TS 24.008 version 15.8.0 Release 15                    92                        ETSI TS 124 008 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


authentication challenge) or the UMTS ciphering key and the UMTS integrity key (in case of a UMTS authentication
challenge) which may be computed from the RAND parameter carried in that message.

If an authentication procedure has been completed successfully and a ciphering key sequence number is stored in the
network, the network shall include a different ciphering key sequence number in the AUTHENTICATION REQUEST
message when it intiates a new authentication procedure.

The mobile station stores the ciphering key sequence number with the GSM ciphering key (in case of a GSM
authentication challenge) and the UMTS ciphering key and the UMTS integrity key (in case of a UMTS authentication
challenge) and indicates to the network in the first message (LOCATION UPDATING REQUEST, CM SERVICE
REQUEST, PAGING RESPONSE, CM RE-ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST) which ciphering key sequence number
the stored GSM ciphering key (in case of a GSM authentication challenge) or set of UMTS ciphering, UMTS integrity,
derived GSM ciphering key, and potentially the derived GSM Kc128 (in case of a UMTS authentication challenge) has.

When the deletion of the ciphering key sequence number is described this also means that the associated GSM
ciphering key, the UMTS ciphering key and the UMTS integrity key shall be considered as invalid and also the GSM
Kc128 shall be deleted if any (i.e. the established GSM security context or the UMTS security context is no longer valid).

In A/Gb mode, the network may choose to start ciphering with the stored GSM ciphering key or GSM Kc128 (under the
restrictions given in 3GPP TS 42.009 [5]) if the stored ciphering key sequence number and the one given from the
mobile station are equal.

   NOTE 1: The decision of starting ciphering with the GSM ciphering key or the GSM Kc128 depends on whether the
           network indicates in the CIPHERING MODE COMMAND message an A5 ciphering algorithm which
           requires a 64 or 128-bit ciphering key as specified in 3GPP TS 33.102 [5a].

In Iu mode, the network may choose to start ciphering and integrity with the stored UMTS ciphering key and UMTS
integrity key (under the restrictions given in 3GPP TS 42.009 [5] and 3GPP TS 33.102 [5a]) if the stored ciphering key
sequence number and the one given from the mobile station are equal.

   NOTE 2: In some specifications the term KSI (Key Set Identifier) might be used instead of the term ciphering key
           sequence number.

4.3.2.5           Authentication not accepted by the network
If the authentication response (RES or SRES) is not valid, the network response depends upon the type of identity used
by the mobile station in the first message, that is:

   -   the TMSI was used; or

   -   the IMSI was used.

If the TMSI has been used, the network may decide to initiate the identification procedure. If the IMSI given by the
mobile station then differs from the one the network had associated with the TMSI, the authentication should be
restarted with the correct parameters. If the IMSI provided by the MS is the expected one (i.e. authentication has really
failed), the network should send an AUTHENTICATION REJECT message to the mobile station.

If the IMSI has been used, or the network decides not to try the identification procedure, an AUTHENTICATION
REJECT message should be transferred to the mobile station.

After having sent this message, all MM connections in progress (if any) are released and the network should initiate the
RR connection release procedure described in subclause 3.5.of 3GPP TS 44.018 [84] (A/Gb mode only),
3GPP TS 25.331 [23c] (UTRAN Iu mode only), or in 3GPP TS 44.118 [111] (GERAN Iu mode only).

Upon receipt of an AUTHENTICATION REJECT message,

   a) if the message has been successfully integrity checked by the lower layers, the mobile station shall set the update
      status in the SIM/USIM to U3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED, delete from the SIM/USIM the stored TMSI, LAI
      and ciphering key sequence number. The SIM/USIM shall be considered as invalid until switching off or the
      SIM/USIM is removed. If the MS maintains a counter for "SIM/USIM considered invalid for non-GPRS
      services", then the MS shall set this counter to MS implementation-specific maximum value. If the MS maintains
      a counter for "SIM/USIM considered invalid for GPRS services", then the MS shall set this counter to MS
      implementation-specific maximum value.

   b) if the message is received without integrity protection, then the MS shall start timer T3247 with a random value
      uniformly drawn from the range between 30 minutes and 60 minutes, if the timer is not running (see
      subclause 4.1.1.6A). Additionally, the MS shall:

       -   if the MS maintains a counter for "SIM/USIM considered invalid for non-GPRS services" events and the
           counter has a value less than an MS implementation-specific maximum value, proceed as specified in
           subclause 4.1.1.6A, list item 1.a) for the case a LOCATION UPDATING REJECT message is received
           without integrity protection. Additionally, if the MS maintains a counter for "SIM/USIM considered invalid
           for GPRS services", then the MS shall increment this counter; and

       -   otherwise proceed as specified under list item a) above for the case that the message has been successfully
           checked by the lower layers.

List item b) above is also applicable, if the message is received in A/Gb mode.

If the AUTHENTICATION REJECT message is received in the state IMSI DETACH INITIATED the mobile station
shall follow subclause 4.3.4.3.

If the AUTHENTICATION REJECT message is received in any other state the mobile station shall abort any MM
specific, MM connection establishment or call re-establishment procedure, stop any of the timers T3210, T3230, T3214
or T3216 (if they were running), release all MM connections (if any), start timer T3240 and enter the state WAIT FOR
NETWORK COMMAND, expecting the release of the RR connection. If the RR connection is not released within a
given time controlled by the timer T3240, the mobile station shall abort the RR connection. In both cases, either after a
RR connection release triggered from the network side or after a RR connection abort requested by the MS-side, the MS
enters state MM IDLE, substate NO IMSI.

4.3.2.5.1            Authentication not accepted by the MS
In a UMTS authentication challenge, the authentication procedure is extended to allow the MS to check the authenticity
of the core network. Thus allowing, for instance, detection of false base station.

Following a UMTS authentication challenge, the MS may reject the core network, on the grounds of an incorrect
AUTN parameter (see 3GPP TS 33.102 [5a]). This parameter contains two possible causes for authentication failure:

   a) MAC code failure:

           If the MS considers the MAC code (supplied by the core network in the AUTN parameter) to be invalid, it
           shall send an AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message to the network, with the reject cause 'MAC failure'.
           The MS shall then follow the procedure described in subclause 4.3.2.6 (c).

   b) SQN failure:

           If the MS considers the SQN (supplied by the core network in the AUTN parameter) to be out of range, it
           shall send a AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message to the network, with the reject cause 'Synch failure'
           and a re-synchronization token AUTS provided by the USIM (see 3GPP TS 33.102 [5a]). The MS shall then
           follow the procedure described in subclause 4.3.2.6 (d).

In UMTS, an MS with a USIM inserted shall reject the authentication challenge if no Authentication Parameter AUTN
IE was present in the AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message (i.e. a GSM authentication challenge has been received
when the MS expects a UMTS authentication challenge). In such a case, the MS shall send the AUTHENTICATION
FAILURE message to the network, with the reject cause "GSM authentication unacceptable". The MS shall then follow
the procedure described in subclause 4.3.2.6 (c).

If the MS returns an AUTHENTICATION_FAILURE message to the network, the MS shall delete any previously
stored RAND and RES and shall stop timer T3218, if running.

4.3.2.6           Abnormal cases
   (a) RR connection failure:

       Upon detection of a RR connection failure before the AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message is received,
       the network shall release all MM connections (if any) and abort any ongoing MM specific procedure.

   (b) Expiry of timer T3260:

3GPP TS 24.008 version 15.8.0 Release 15                  94                        ETSI TS 124 008 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


      The authentication procedure is supervised on the network side by the timer T3260. At expiry of this timer the
      network may release the RR connection. In this case the network shall abort the authentication procedure and
      any ongoing MM specific procedure, release all MM connections if any, and initiate the RR connection release
      procedure described in subclause 3.5 of 3GPP TS 44.018 [84] (A/Gb mode only), 3GPP TS 25.331 [23c]
      (UTRAN Iu mode only), or in 3GPP TS 44.118 [111] (GERAN Iu mode only).

   (c) Authentication failure (reject cause "MAC failure" or "GSM authentication unacceptable"):

      The MS shall send an AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message, with reject cause "MAC failure" or "GSM
      authentication unacceptable" according to subclause 4.3.2.5.1, to the network and start timer T3214.
      Furthermore, the MS shall stop any of the retransmission timers that are running (e.g. T3210, T3220 or T3230).
      Upon the first receipt of an AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message from the MS with reject cause "MAC
      failure" or "GSM authentication unacceptable", the network may initiate the identification procedure described
      in subclause 4.3.3. This is to allow the network to obtain the IMSI from the MS. The network may then check
      that the TMSI originally used in the authentication challenge corresponded to the correct IMSI. Upon receipt of
      the IDENTITY REQUEST message from the network, the MS shall send the IDENTITY RESPONSE message.

   NOTE:     Upon receipt of an AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message from the MS with reject cause "MAC
             failure" or "GSM authentication unacceptable", the network may also terminate the authentication
             procedure (see subclause 4.3.2.5).

      If the TMSI/IMSI mapping in the network was incorrect, the network should respond by sending a new
      AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message to the MS. Upon receiving the new AUTHENTICATION REQUEST
      message from the network, the MS shall stop the timer T3214, if running, and then process the challenge
      information as normal. If theTMSI/IMSI mapping in the network was correct, the network should terminate the
      authentication procedure by sending an AUTHENTICATION REJECT message.

      If the network is validated successfully (an AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message that contains a valid SQN
      and MAC is received), the MS shall send the AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message to the network and
      shall start any retransmission timers (e.g. T3210, T3220 or T3230), if they were running and stopped when the
      MS received the first failed AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message.

      If the MS receives the second AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message while T3214 is running, and the MAC
      value cannot be resolved or the message contains a GSM authentication challenge, the MS shall follow the
      procedure specified in this subclause (c), starting again from the beginning. If the SQN is invalid, the MS shall
      proceed as specified in (d).

      It can be assumed that the source of the authentication challenge is not genuine (authentication not accepted by
      the MS) if any of the following occur:

      -   the timer T3214 expires;

      -   the MS detects any combination of the authentication failures: "MAC failure", "invalid SQN", and "GSM
          authentication unacceptable", during three consecutive authentication challenges. The authentication
          challenges shall be considered as consecutive only, if the authentication challenges causing the second and
          third authentication failure are received by the MS, while the timer T3214 or T3216 started after the previous
          authentication failure is running.

      The MS shall stop timer T3214, if the timer is running and the MS detects an RR connection failure or the
      network releases the RR connection.

      When it has been deemed by the MS that the source of the authentication challenge is not genuine (i.e.
      authentication not accepted by the MS), the MS shall behave as described in subclause 4.3.2.6.1.

                    (reject cause "MAC failure" or "GSM authentication unacceptable")

   (d) Authentication failure (reject cause "synch failure"):

      The MS shall send an AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message, with reject cause "synch failure", to the
      network and start the timer T3216. Furthermore, the MS shall stop any of the retransmission timers that are
      running (e.g. T3210, T3220 or T3230). Upon the first receipt of an AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message
      from the MS with the reject cause "synch failure", the network shall use the returned AUTS parameter from the
      authentication failure parameter IE in the AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message, to re-synchronise. The re-
      synchronisation procedure requires the VLR/MSC to delete all unused authentication vectors for that IMSI and
      obtain new vectors from the HLR. When re-synchronisation is complete, the network shall initiate the
      authentication procedure. Upon receipt of the AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message, the MS shall stop the
      timer T3216, if running.

   NOTE:      Upon receipt of two consecutive AUTHENTICATION FAILURE messages from the MS with reject
              cause "synch failure", the network may terminate the authentication procedure by sending an
              AUTHENTICATION REJECT message.

      If the network is validated successfully (a new AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message is received which
      contains a valid SQN and MAC) while T3216 is running, the MS shall send the AUTHENTICATION
      RESPONSE message to the network and shall start any retransmission timers (e.g. T3210, T3220 or T3230), if
      they were running and stopped when the MS received the first failed AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message.

      If the MS receives the second AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message while T3216 is running, and the MAC
      value cannot be resolved or the message contains a GSM authentication challenge, the MS shall proceed as
      specified in (c); if the SQN is invalid, the MS shall follow the procedure specified in this subclause (d), starting
      again fom the beginning.

      The MS shall deem that the network has failed the authentication check and behave as described in
      subclause 4.3.2.6.1, if any of the following occurs:

      -   the timer T3216 expires;

      -   the MS detects any combination of the authentication failures: "MAC failure", "invalid SQN", and "GSM
          authentication unacceptable", during three consecutive authentication challenges. The authentication
          challenges shall be considered as consecutive only, if the authentication challenges causing the second and
          third authentication failure are received by the MS, while the timer T3214 or T3216 started after the previous
          authentication failure is running.

       The MS shall stop timer T3216, if the timer is running and the MS detects an RR connection failure or the
       network releases the RR connection.

       When it has been deemed by the MS that the source of the authentication challenge is not genuine (i.e.
       authentication not accepted by the MS), the MS shall behave as described in subclause 4.3.2.6.1.

       Upon receipt of an AUTHENTICATION REJECT message, the mobile station shall perform the actions as
       specified in subclause 4.3.2.5. If an MS has an MM connection for an emergency call established or is
       establishing an MM connection for an emergency call when timer T3214 or T3216 expires, the MS shall not
       deem that the network has failed the authentication check and not behave as described in subclause 4.3.2.6.1.

4.3.2.6.1            MS behaviour towards a network that has failed the authentication procedure
If the MS deems that the network has failed the authentication check, then it shall request RR or RRC to release the RR
connection and the PS signalling connection, if any, and bar the active cell or cells (see 3GPP TS 25.331 [23c],
3GPP TS 25.304 [98] and 3GPP TS 44.018 [84]). The MS shall start any retransmission timers (e.g. T3210, T3220 or
T3230), if they were running and stopped when the MS received the first AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message
containing an invalid MAC or invalid SQN, or no AUTN when a UMTS authentication challenge was expected.

4.3.2.7          Handling of keys at intersystem change from Iu mode to A/Gb mode
At inter-system change from Iu mode to A/Gb mode, ciphering may be started (see 3GPP TS 44.018 [84]) without any
new authentication procedure. Deduction of the appropriate security key for ciphering in A/Gb mode, depends on the
current GSM/UMTS security context stored in the MS and the network.

The ME shall handle the GSM ciphering key and a potential GSM Kc128 according to table 4.3.2.7.1.

   NOTE:      A USIM with UMTS security context, passes the UMTS ciphering key, the UMTS integrity key and the
              derived GSM ciphering key to the ME independent on the current radio access being UTRAN or
              GERAN.

4.3.2.7a         Use of established security contexts
In A/Gb mode, in the case of an established GSM security context, the GSM ciphering key shall be loaded from the
SIM/USIM and taken into use by the ME when any valid CIPHERING MODE COMMAND is received during an RR
connection (the definition of a valid CIPHERING MODE COMMAND message is given in 3GPP TS 44.018 [84]
subclause 3.4.7.2).

In A/Gb mode, in the case of an established UMTS security context, the GSM ciphering key shall be loaded from the
USIM and taken into use by the MS when a valid CIPHERING MODE COMMAND is received during an RR
connection (the definition of a valid CIPHERING MODE COMMAND message is given in 3GPP TS 44.018 [84]
subclause 3.4.7.2) which indicates an A5 ciphering algorithm that requires a 64-bit ciphering key. The network shall
derive a GSM ciphering key from the UMTS ciphering key and the UMTS integrity key by using the conversion
function named "c3" defined in 3GPP TS 33.102 [5a].

In A/Gb mode, in the case of an established UMTS security context, the UMTS ciphering key and the UMTS integrity
key shall be loaded from the USIM in order for the ME to derive the GSM Kc128 (see 3GPP TS 33.102 [5a]) and shall
be taken into use by the ME when a valid CIPHERING MODE COMMAND is received during an RR connection (the
definition of a valid CIPHERING MODE COMMAND message is given in 3GPP TS 44.018 [84] subclause 3.4.7.2)
which indicates an A5 ciphering algorithm that requires a 128-bit ciphering key. The network shall derive a GSM Kc128
from the UMTS ciphering key and the UMTS integrity as defined in 3GPP TS 33.102 [5a].

In Iu mode, in the case of an established GSM security context, the ME shall derive a UMTS ciphering key and a
UMTS integrity key from the GSM ciphering key by using the conversion functions named "c4" and "c5" defined in
3GPP TS 33.102 [5a]. The GSM ciphering key shall be loaded from the SIM/USIM and the derived UMTS ciphering
key and UMTS integrity key shall be taken into use by the MS when a valid SECURITY MODE COMMAND
indicating CS domain is received during an RR connection (the definition of a valid SECURITY MODE COMMAND
message is given in 3GPP TS 25.331 [23c] and 3GPP TS 44.118 [111]). The network shall derive a UMTS ciphering
key and a UMTS integrity key from the GSM ciphering key by using the conversion functions named "c4" and "c5"
defined in 3GPP TS 33.102 [5a].

In Iu mode, in the case of an established UMTS security context, the UMTS ciphering key and UMTS integrity key
shall be loaded from the USIM and taken into use by the MS when a valid SECURITY MODE COMMAND indicating
CS domain is received during a RR connection (the definition of a valid SECURITY MODE COMMAND message is
given in 3GPP TS 25.331 [23c] and 3GPP TS 44.118 [111]).

In Iu mode and A/Gb mode, if the MS received a valid SECURITY MODE COMMAND indicating CS domain in Iu
mode or a valid CIPHERING MODE COMMAND in A/Gb mode before the network initiates a new Authentication
procedure and establishes a new GSM/UMTS security context, the new keys are taken into use in the MS when a new
valid SECURITY MODE COMMAND indicating CS domain in Iu mode, or a new valid CIPHERING MODE
COMMAND in A/Gb mode, is received during the RR connection. In case of Iu mode to Iu mode handover, A/Gb
mode to A/Gb mode handover, or inter-system change to A/Gb mode, the MS and the network shall continue to use the
key from the old key set until a new valid SECURITY MODE COMMAND indicating CS domain in Iu mode, or a new
valid CIPHERING MODE COMMAND in A/Gb mode, is received during the RR connection. In case of inter-system
change to Iu mode, the MS and the network shall continue to use the keys from the old key set until the second valid
SECURITY MODE COMMAND indicating CS domain is received during the RR connection.

   NOTE 1: If the MS received a valid SECURITY MODE COMMAND indicating CS domain in Iu mode or a valid
           CIPHERING MODE COMMAND in A/Gb mode before the inter-system change to Iu mode occurs, the
           first SECURITY MODE COMMAND message after the inter-system change, which indicates CS domain
           and includes only an Integrity protection mode IE, is initiated by the UTRAN without receipt of a
           corresponding RANAP security mode control procedure from the MSC/VLR. The only purpose of this
           SECURITY MODE COMMAND message is to activate the integrity protection, but not to load a new
           key set from the SIM/USIM (see 3GPP TS 25.331 [23c] and 3GPP TS 44.118 [111]).

   NOTE 2: If the MS did not receive any valid SECURITY MODE COMMAND indicating CS domain in Iu mode
           or any valid CIPHERING MODE COMMAND in A/Gb mode before the inter-system change to Iu mode
           occurs, the first SECURITY MODE COMMAND message after the inter-system change, which indicates
           CS domain, is initiated by the UTRAN on receipt of a RANAP security mode control procedure from the
           MSC/VLR. The purpose of this SECURITY MODE COMMAND message is to load a key set from the
           SIM/USIM and to activate either integrity protection or ciphering and integrity protection (see
           3GPP TS 25.331 [23c] and 3GPP TS 44.118 [111]).

4.3.2.8          Handling of keys at intersystem change from A/Gb mode to Iu mode
At inter-system change from A/Gb mode to Iu mode, ciphering and integrity may be started (see
3GPP TS 25.331 [23c]) without any new authentication procedure. Deduction of the appropriate security keys for
ciphering and integrity check in Iu mode, depends on the current GSM/UMTS security context stored in the MS and the
network.

The ME shall handle the UMTS ciphering key and the UMTS integrity key according to table 4.3.2.8.1.

4.3.2.10         Derivation of keys at SRVCC or vSRVCC handover from S1 mode

4.3.2.10.0          General
   NOTE:     The keys CKSRVCC and IKSRVCC apply for both SRVCC and vSRVCC.

4.3.2.10.1          PDN connection with integrity protection
At PS to CS domain change from S1 mode due to SRVCC or vSRVCC handover of a PDN connection for which the
"null integrity protection algorithm" EIA0 has not been used (see 3GPP TS 23.216 [126]), when the MS receives the
command to perform handover, the MS shall derive a UMTS security context for the CS domain from the current EPS
security context.

The MS shall set the CKSN of the derived UMTS security context to the value of the eKSI of the EPS security context
and derive security keys CKSRVCC and IKSRVCC as specified in 3GPP TS 33.401 [123]. The ME shall also derive the
security key GSM ciphering key Kc from CKSRVCC and IKSRVCC using the conversion function c3 as specified in
3GPP TS 33.102 [5a]. The MS shall apply these derived security keys, handle the STARTCS value as specified in
3GPP TS 25.331 [23c] and replace an already established UMTS security context for the CS domain, if any, in the
USIM, when the SRVCC or vSRVCC handover from S1 mode has been completed successfully.

   NOTE:     Because of deriving a new UMTS security context for the CS domain, a new GSM ciphering key needs
             also to be derived from the new derived UMTS security keys for the CS domain (i.e. CKSRVCC and
             IKSRVCC). Note that the new GSM ciphering key is also part of the new UMTS security context for the CS
             domain as well, as any old GSM ciphering key stored in the USIM and in the ME, belongs to an old
             UMTS security context for the CS domain and can no longer be used.

The network shall replace an already established UMTS security context for the CS domain, if any, when the SRVCC
or vSRVCC handover from S1 mode has been completed successfully.



If the SRVCC or vSRVCC handover from S1mode has not been completed successfully, the MS and the network shall
delete the new derived GSM or UMTS security context for the CS domain. Additionally, the network shall delete the
already established GSM or UMTS security context for the CS domain, if the CKSN of the already established GSM or
UMTS security context is equal to the CKSN of the new derived GSM or UMTS security context for the CS domain.

4.3.2.10.2          PDN connection without integrity protection
At PS to CS domain change from S1 mode due to SRVCC handover of a PDN connection for emergency bearer
services for which the "null integrity protection algorithm" EIA0 has been used while in S1 mode, the MS and the
network shall not perform key derivation.

4.3.2.11         Derivation of keys at SRVCC handover from Iu mode to Iu mode

4.3.2.11.1          PDN connection with integrity protection
At PS to CS domain change from Iu mode to Iu mode due to SRVCC handover of a PDN connection for which integrity
protection has been activated, ciphering and integrity may be started (see 3GPP TS 25.331 [23c]) without any new
authentication procedure. Deduction of the appropriate security keys for ciphering and integrity check in Iu mode,
depends on the current GSM or UMTS security context for the PS domain stored in the MS and the network.

The ME shall handle the UMTS ciphering key and the UMTS integrity key according to table 4.3.2.11.1.

   NOTE 1: For the case of an established UMTS security context for the PS domain, because of deriving a new
           UMTS security context for the CS domain, a new GSM ciphering key needs to be derived from the new
           derived UMTS security keys (i.e. CK' and IK'). Note that the new GSM ciphering key is also part of the
           new UMTS security context for the CS domain, and therefore any old GSM ciphering key stored in the
           USIM and in the ME belongs to an old UMTS security context for the CS domain and can no longer be
           taken into use.

The network shall replace an already established GSM or UMTS security context for the CS domain, if any, when the
SRVCC handover from Iu mode to Iu mode has been completed successfully.

If the SRVCC handover from Iu mode to Iu mode has not been completed successfully, the MS and the network shall
delete the new derived GSM or UMTS security context for the CS domain. Additionally, the network shall delete the
already established GSM or UMTS security context for the CS domain, if the CKSN of the already established GSM or
UMTS security context is equal to the CKSN of the new derived GSM or UMTS security context for the CS domain.

4.3.2.11.2          PDN connection without integrity protection
At PS to CS domain change from Iu mode to Iu mode due to SRVCC handover of a PDN connection for emergency
bearer services for which integrity protection has not been activated before the SRVCC handover, the MS and the
network shall not perform key derivation.

At change from A/Gb mode to Iu mode due to CS to PS SRVCC handover, ciphering may be started and integrity
protection shall be started (see 3GPP TS 25.331 [23c]) without any new authentication procedure. Derivation of the
appropriate security keys for ciphering and integrity protection for the PS domain in Iu mode depends on the current
GSM or UMTS security context for the CS domain stored in the MS and the network.

The ME shall handle the PS UMTS ciphering key and the PS UMTS integrity key according to table 4.3.2.13.1.

The network shall replace an already established GSM or UMTS security context for the PS domain, if any, when the
CS to PS SRVCC handover from A/Gb mode to Iu mode has been completed successfully.

If the CS to PS SRVCC handover from A/Gb mode to Iu mode has not been completed successfully, the MS and the
network shall delete the new derived GSM or UMTS security context for the PS domain. Additionally, the network
shall delete the already established GSM or UMTS security context for the PS domain, if the GPRS CKSN of the
already established GSM or UMTS security context is equal to the GPRS CKSN of the new derived GSM or UMTS
security context for the PS domain.

4.3.3         Identification procedure

4.3.3.0           General
The identification procedure is used by the network to request a mobile station to provide specific identification
parameters to the network e.g. International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI), International Mobile Equipment
Identity (IMEI). IMEI and IMSI definition and structure are specified in 3GPP TS 23.003 [10].

4.3.3.1           Identity request by the network
The network initiates the identification procedure by sending an IDENTITY REQUEST message to the mobile station
and starting the timer T3270 (see figure 4.3). The IDENTITY REQUEST message specifies the requested identification
parameters in the Identity type information element.

4.3.3.2           Identification response by the mobile station
The mobile station shall be ready to respond to an IDENTITY REQUEST message at any time whilst a RR connection
exists.

Upon receipt of the IDENTITY REQUEST message the mobile station shall send an IDENTITY RESPONSE message.
The IDENTITY RESPONSE message shall contain the identification parameters as requested by the network.

Upon receipt of the IDENTITY REQUEST message with the Identity type IE indicating that P-TMSI, RAI and P-TMSI
signature are being requested, an MS that supports S1 mode shall handle the IDENTITY RESPONSE message as
follows:

   -   If the TIN indicates "GUTI" and the MS holds a valid GUTI, the MS shall map the GUTI into a P-TMSI,
       P-TMSI signature and RAI as specified in 3GPP TS 23.003 [10]. The MS shall indicate the P-TMSI in the
       Mobile identity IE. In addition, the MS shall include the mapped RAI in the Routing area identification IE and
       the mapped P-TMSI signature in the P-TMSI signature IE. In addition, the MS shall include the P-TMSI type IE
       with P-TMSI type set to "mapped P-TMSI".

   -   If the TIN indicates "P-TMSI" or "RAT-related TMSI" and the MS holds a valid P-TMSI and RAI, the MS shall
       indicate the P-TMSI in the Mobile identity IE and shall indicate the RAI in the Routing area identification IE. In
       addition, the MS shall include the P-TMSI type IE with P-TMSI type set to "native P-TMSI". If the MS holds a
       valid P-TMSI signature, it shall include it in the P-TMSI signature IE.

If the MS does not support S1 mode, it shall handle the IDENTITY RESPONSE message as follows:

   -   If the MS holds a valid P-TMSI and RAI, the MS shall indicate the P-TMSI in the Mobile identity IE and shall
       indicate the RAI in the Routing area identification IE. In addition, the MS shall include the P-TMSI type IE with
       P-TMSI type set to "native P-TMSI". If the MS holds a valid P-TMSI signature, it shall include it in the P-TMSI
       signature IE.

Upon receipt of the IDENTITY RESPONSE message, the network shall stop timer T3270.

4.3.3.3           Abnormal cases in the mobile station
The following abnormal case can be identified:

   a) Requested identity is not available

       If the MS cannot encode the requested identity in the IDENTITY RESPONSE message, e.g. because no valid
       SIM is available, then it shall encode the identity type as "no identity".

4.3.3.4           Abnormal cases on the network side
The following abnormal cases can be identified:

   a) RR connection failure:




                                                          ETSI

       Upon detection of a RR connection failure before the IDENTITY RESPONSE message is received, the network
       shall release all MM connections (if any) and abort any ongoing MM specific procedure.

   b) Expiry of timer T3270:

       The identification procedure is supervised by the network by the timer T3270. At expiry of the timer T3270 the
       network may release the RR connection. In this case, the network shall abort the identification procedure and any
       ongoing MM specific procedure, release all MM connections if any, and initiate the RR connection release
       procedure as described in 3GPP TS 44.018 [84] subclause 3.5, 3GPP TS 25.331 [23c] (UTRAN Iu mode only),
       or in 3GPP TS 44.118 [111] (GERAN Iu mode only).

4.3.4         IMSI detach procedure

4.3.4.0           General
The IMSI detach procedure may be invoked by a mobile station if the mobile station is deactivated or if the Subscriber
Identity Module (see 3GPP TS 42.017 [7] and 3GPP TS 31.102 [112]) is detached from the mobile station or as part of
the eCall inactivity procedure defined in subclause 4.4.7.

In A/Gb mode and GERAN Iu mode, the network indicates whether the IMSI detach/attach procedures are required by
using the ATT flag which is broadcast in the L3-RR SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 3 message on the BCCH (see
3GPP TS 44.018 [84] subclause 10.5.2.11). The mobile station shall use the value of the ATT flag that was broadcast
when the mobile station was in the MM IDLE state.

In UTRAN Iu mode, the network indicates whether the IMSI detach/attach procedures are required by using the ATT
flag which is included in the CS domain specific system information element (see subclause 10.5.1.12.2). The mobile
station shall use the latest received value of the ATT flag.

If a RR connection exists and the ATT flag indicates that the IMSI detach/attach procedures are not required, the MM
sublayer will release locally any ongoing MM connections before releasing the RR connection. If an MM specific
procedure is active, the release of the RR connection may be delayed until the MM specific procedure is complete.

The IMSI detach procedure causes the mobile station to be indicated as inactive in the network.

The mobile station is allowed to initiate the IMSI detach procedure even if the timer T3246 is running.

The network proceeds with the IMSI detach procedure even if NAS level mobility management congestion control is
active.

4.3.4.1           IMSI detach initiation by the mobile station
The IMSI detach procedure consists only of the IMSI DETACH INDICATION message sent from the mobile station to
the network. The mobile station then starts timer T3220 and enters the MM sublayer state IMSI DETACH INITIATED.

If no RR connection exists, the MM sublayer within the mobile station will request the RR sublayer to establish a RR
connection. If establishment of the RR connection is not possible because a suitable cell is not (or not yet) available
then, the mobile station shall try for a period of at least 5 seconds and for not more than a period of 20 seconds to find a
suitable cell. If a suitable cell is found during this time then, the mobile station shall request the RR sublayer to establish
an RR connection, otherwise the IMSI detach is aborted. For:

   -   a shared GERAN in A/Gb mode, if the MS is a GERAN network sharing supporting MS, the chosen PLMN
       identity shall be indicated to the GERAN in the IMSI DETACH INDICATION message using the Skip Indicator
       IE as specified in subclause 10.3.1 and;

3GPP TS 24.008 version 15.8.0 Release 15                   106                        ETSI TS 124 008 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


   -   a shared UTRAN, the chosen PLMN identity shall be indicated to the UTRAN in the RRC INITIAL DIRECT
       TRANSFER message (see 3GPP TS 25.331 [23c]).

If a RR connection exists, the MM sublayer will release locally any ongoing MM connections before the IMSI
DETACH INDICATION message is sent.

The IMSI detach procedure may not be started if a MM specific procedure is active. If possible, the IMSI detach
procedure is then delayed until the MM specific procedure is finished, else the IMSI detach is omitted.

4.3.4.2           IMSI detach procedure in the network
When receiving an IMSI DETACH INDICATION message, the network may set an inactive indication for the IMSI.
No response is returned to the mobile station. After reception of the IMSI DETACH INDICATION message the
network shall release locally any ongoing MM connections, and start the normal RR connection release procedure (see
3GPP TS 44.018 [84] subclause 3.5 (A/Gb mode only), 3GPP TS 25.331 [23c] (UTRAN Iu mode only), or in
3GPP TS 44.118 [111] (GERAN Iu mode only)).

Only applicable for a network supporting VGCS: If an IMSI DETACH INDICATION message is received from the
talking mobile station in a group call while the network is in service state MM CONNECTION ACTIVE (GROUP
TRANSMIT MODE), the network shall release locally the ongoing MM connection and then go to the service state
GROUP CALL ACTIVE.

4.3.4.3           IMSI detach completion by the mobile station
Timer T3220 is stopped when the RR connection is released. The mobile station should, if possible, delay the local
release of the channel to allow a normal release from the network side until T3220 timeout. If this is not possible (e.g.
detach at power down) the RR sublayer on the mobile station side should be aborted.

4.3.4.4           Abnormal cases
The following abnormal cases can be identified:

   a) Lower layer failure

   If the establishment of an RR connection is unsuccessful, or the RR connection is lost, the IMSI detach is aborted by
       the mobile station.

   b) Access barred because of access class control or EAB

       The signalling procedure for IMSI detach shall not be started. The MS starts the signalling procedure as soon as
       possible and if still necessary, i.e. when the barred state is removed or because of a cell change, or performs a
       local detach immediately or after an implementation dependent time.




                               Figure 4.4/3GPP TS 24.008: IMSI detach sequence


4.3.5         Abort procedure
The abort procedure may be invoked by the network to abort any on-going MM connection establishment or already
established MM connection. The mobile station shall treat ABORT message as compatible with current protocol state
only if it is received when at least one MM connection exists or an MM connection is being established.

4.3.5.1           Abort procedure initiation by the network
The abort procedure consists only of the ABORT message sent from the network to the mobile station. Before the
sending of the ABORT message the network shall locally release any ongoing MM connection. After the sending the
network may start the normal RR connection release procedure.




                                                           ETSI

The Cause information element indicates the reason for the abortion. The following cause values may apply:

       # 6:   Illegal ME

       #17:   Network failure

4.3.5.2          Abort procedure in the mobile station
At the receipt of the ABORT message the mobile station shall abort any MM connection establishment or call re-
establishment procedure and release all MM connections (if any). If cause value #6 is received the mobile station shall
delete any TMSI, LAI and ciphering key sequence number stored in the SIM/USIM, set the update status to ROAMING
NOT ALLOWED (and store it in the SIM/USIM according to subclause 4.1.2.2) and consider the SIM/USIM invalid
until switch off or the SIM/USIM is removed. If the message has been successfully integrity checked by the lower
layers and the MS maintains a counter for "SIM/USIM considered invalid for non-GPRS services", then the MS shall
set this counter to MS implementation-specific maximum value. As a consequence the mobile station enters state MM
IDLE, substate NO IMSI after the release of the RR connection.

The mobile station shall then wait for the network to release the RR connection - see subclause 4.5.3.1.


4.3.6         MM information procedure
The MM information message support is optional in the network.

The MM information procedure may be invoked by the network at any time during an RR connection.

4.3.6.1          MM information procedure initiation by the network
The MM information procedure consists only of the MM INFORMATION message sent from the network to the
mobile station. During an RR connection, the network shall send none, one, or more MM INFORMATION messages to
the mobile station. If more than one MM INFORMATION message is sent, the messages need not have the same
content.

   NOTE:      The network may be able to select particular instants where it can send the MM INFORMATION
              message without adding delay to, or interrupting, any CM layer transaction, e.g. immediately after the
              AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message.

4.3.6.2          MM information procedure in the mobile station
When the mobile station (supporting the MM information message) receives an MM INFORMATION message, it shall
accept the message and optionally use the contents to update appropriate information stored within the mobile station.

If the mobile station does not support the MM information message the mobile station shall ignore the contents of the
message and return an MM STATUS message with cause #97.


4.4           MM specific procedures
A MM specific procedure can only be started if no other MM specific procedure is running or no MM connection exists
between the network and the mobile station. The end of the running MM specific procedure or the release of all MM
connections have to be awaited before a new MM specific procedure can be started.

During the lifetime of a MM specific procedure, if a MM connection establishment is requested by a CM entity, this
request will either be rejected or be delayed until the running MM specific procedure is terminated (this depends on the
implementation).

Any MM common procedure (except IMSI detach) may be initiated during a MM specific procedure.

Unless it has specific permission from the network (follow-on proceed) the mobile station side should await the release
of the RR connection used for a MM specific procedure before a new MM specific procedure or MM connection
establishment is started.

   NOTE:      The network side may use the same RR connection for MM connection management.

4.4.1         Location updating procedure
The location updating procedure is a general procedure which is used for the following purposes:

   -   normal location updating (described in this subclause);

   -   periodic updating (see subclause 4.4.2); or

   -   IMSI attach (see subclause 4.4.3).

The normal location updating procedure is used to update the registration of the actual Location Area of a mobile
station in the network. The location updating type information element in the LOCATION UPDATING REQUEST
message shall indicate normal location updating. The conditions under which the normal location updating procedure is
used by a mobile station in the MM IDLE state are defined for each service state in subclause 4.2.2.

Only applicable for mobile stations supporting VGCS listening or VBS listening: A mobile station in RR group receive
mode is in the MM IDLE state, substate RECEIVING GROUP CALL (NORMAL SERVICE) or RECEIVING GROUP
CALL (LIMITED SERVICE). To perform a location updating, the MS in RR group receive mode shall leave the group
receive mode, establish an independent dedicated RR connection to perform the location updating as described above
and return to the RR group receive mode afterwards.

The MS shall also start the normal location updating procedure:

   a) if the network indicates that the mobile station is unknown in the VLR as a response to MM connection
      establishment request;

   b) void

   c) when the MS, configured to use CS fallback and SMS over SGs, or SMS over SGs only, enters a GERAN or
      UTRAN cell in network operation mode II and timer T3423 has expired or is in the GERAN or UTRAN cell in
      network operation mode II when timer T3423 expires;

   NOTE 1: Timer T3423 is specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 [120].

   d) when the MS, configured to use CS fallback and SMS over SGs, or SMS over SGs only, enters a GERAN or
      UTRAN cell after intersystem change from S1 mode to Iu or A/Gb mode, if timer T3346 is running, and the
      location area of the current cell is the same as the stored location area;

   NOTE 2: If inter-system change is due to a mobile originating CS call, the location updating procedure can be
           performed after the RR connection is released unless the MS moves back to E-UTRAN.

   e) when the MS is both IMSI attached for GPRS and non-GPRS services and enters a new routing area where the
      network operates in network operation mode I and timer T3346 is running.

   f) when the network is operating in network operation mode I, timer T3346 is running, timer T3246 is not running,
      and due to manual CSG selection the MS has selected a CSG cell whose CSG identity and associated PLMN
      identity are not included in the Allowed CSG list or in the Operator CSG list of the MS;

   g) when due to a manual CSG selection the MS has selected a CSG cell whose CSG identity and associated PLMN
      identity are not included in the MS's Allowed CSG list or in the MS's Operator CSG list;

   h) when the network is operating in network operation mode I, T3346 is running, update status is not U1
      UPDATED and the user manually selects the current PLMN; or

   i) when the MS is configured to use CS fallback and SMS over SGs, or SMS over SGs only, and the TIN indicates
      "GUTI", enters a GERAN or UTRAN cell after intersystem change from S1 mode to Iu or A/Gb mode in NMO
      II and timer T3412 is not running.

If the MS, configured to use CS fallback and SMS over SGs, enters a GERAN or UTRAN cell, after intersystem change
from S1 mode to Iu or A/Gb mode due to CS fallback, and the location area of the current cell is not available, the MS
may initiate the location updating procedure.

When the MS supporting N1 mode in MS operation modes A or B moves from NG-RAN coverage to GERAN
coverage, or from NG-RAN coverage to UTRAN coverage, and the network operates in network operation mode II, the
MS may intiate the normal location updating procedure.




                                                         ETSI
3GPP TS 24.008 version 15.8.0 Release 15                  109                        ETSI TS 124 008 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


To limit the number of consecutive unsuccessful location updating attempts made, an attempt counter is used. The
detailed handling of the attempt counter is described in subclauses 4.4.4.5 to 4.4.4.9.

The mobile equipment shall contain a list of "forbidden location areas for roaming", as well as a list of "forbidden
location areas for regional provision of service". These lists shall be erased when the MS is switched off or when the
SIM/USIM is removed, and periodically (with period in the range 12 to 24 hours). When the lists are erased, the MS
performs a cell selection according to 3GPP TS 43.022 [82] and 3GPP TS 25.304 [98]. The location area identification
received on the BCCH that triggered the location updating request shall be added to the suitable list whenever a
LOCATION AREA UPDATING REJECT message is received with the cause "Roaming not allowed in this location
area", "Location Area not allowed", or "No suitable cells in Location Area". The lists shall accommodate each 10 or
more location area identifications. When the list is full and a new entry has to be inserted, the oldest entry shall be
deleted.

In a shared network, the MS shall choose one of the PLMN identities as specified in 3GPP TS 23.122 [14]. The MS
shall construct the Location Area Identification of the cell from this chosen PLMN identity and the LAC received on the
BCCH. If the constructed LAI is different from the stored LAI, the MS shall initiate the location updating procedure.
For:

   -   a shared GERAN, in A/Gb mode, the chosen PLMN identity shall be indicated to the GERAN in the
       LOCATION UPDATING REQUEST message using the Skip Indicator IE as specified in subclause 10.3.1.

   -   a shared UTRAN, the chosen PLMN identity shall be indicated to the UTRAN in the RRC INITIAL DIRECT
       TRANSFER message (see 3GPP TS 25.331 [23c]).

For GERAN Iu mode, network sharing is not supported.

Whenever a LOCATION UPDATING REJECT message with the cause "PLMN not allowed" is received by the MS,
the PLMN identity used to construct the LAI which triggered the location updating procedure shall be stored in the
"forbidden PLMN list" and if the MS is configured to use timer T3245 (see 3GPP TS 24.368 [135] or
3GPP TS 31.102 [112]) then the MS shall start timer T3245 and proceed as described in subclause 4.1.1.6. Whenever a
LOCATION UPDATING REJECT message is received by the MS with the cause "Roaming not allowed in this
location area", "Location Area not allowed", or "No suitable cells in Location Area", the constructed LAI which
triggered the location updating procedure shall be stored in the suitable list.

The cell selection processes in the different states are described in 3GPP TS 43.022 [82] and 3GPP TS 45.008 [34].

The location updating procedure is always initiated by the mobile station.

In the case that the mobile station is initiating an emergency call but, due to cell re-selection or redirection by the
network, it moves to a different LAI then the mobile station may delay the location updating procedure in the new LA
until after the emergency call is completed.


4.4.2         Periodic updating
Periodic updating may be used to notify periodically the availability of the mobile station to the network. Periodic
updating is performed by using the location updating procedure. The location updating type information element in the
LOCATION UPDATING REQUEST message shall indicate periodic updating.

The procedure is controlled by the timer T3212 in the mobile station. The MS indicates in the MS network feature
support IE whether it supports the extended value for timer T3212. If the MS receives the Per MS T3212 IE in the
LOCATION UPDATING ACCEPT message, the MS shall use this IE to determine the value of T3212 instead of the
value of T3212 that is broadcast. If the MS does not receive the Per MS T3212 IE in the LOCATION UPDATING
ACCEPT message, the MS shall use the value of T3212 that is broadcast . If the timer is not already started, the timer is
started each time the mobile station enters the MM IDLE substate NORMAL SERVICE or ATTEMPTing TO
UPDATE. When the MS leaves the MM Idle State the timer T3212 shall continue running until explicitly stopped.




                                                          ETSI
3GPP TS 24.008 version 15.8.0 Release 15                      110                      ETSI TS 124 008 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


The timer is stopped (shall be set to its initial value for the next start) when:

   -   a LOCATION UPDATING ACCEPT or LOCATION UPDATING REJECT message is received;

   -   an AUTHENTICATION REJECT message is received;

   -   the first MM message is received, or security mode setting is completed in the case of MM connection
       establishment, except when the most recent service state is LIMITED SERVICE;

   -   the mobile station has responded to paging and thereafter has received the first correct layer 3 message except
       RR message;

   -   the mobile station is deactivated (i.e. equipment powered down or SIM/USIM removed).

When the timer T3212 expires, the location updating procedure is started and the timer shall be set to its initial value for
the next start. If the mobile station is in other state than MM Idle when the timer expires the location updating
procedure is delayed until the MM Idle State is entered.

The conditions under which the periodic location updating procedure is used by a mobile station in the MM IDLE state
are defined for each service state in subclause 4.2.2.

If the mobile station is in service state NO CELL AVAILABLE, LIMITED SERVICE, PLMN SEARCH or PLMN
SEARCH-NORMAL SERVICE when the timer expires the location updating procedure is delayed until this service
state is left.

In A/Gb mode and GERAN Iu mode, the (periodic) location updating procedure is not started if the BCCH information
at the time the procedure is triggered indicates that periodic location shall not be used. The timeout value is broadcasted
in the L3-RR SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 3 message on the BCCH, in the Control channel description IE, see
3GPP TS 44.018 [84] subclause 10.5.2.11.

In UTRAN Iu mode, the (periodic) location updating procedure is not started if the information on BCCH or in the last
received dedicated system information at the time the procedure is triggered indicates that periodic location shall not be
used. The timeout value is included in the CS domain specific system information element.

The T3212 timeout value shall not be changed in the NO CELL AVAILABLE, LIMITED SERVICE, PLMN SEARCH
and PLMN SEARCH-NORMAL SERVICE states.

If the MS, configured to use CS fallback and SMS over SGs, or SMS over SGs only, enters a GERAN or UTRAN cell
after intersystem change from S1 mode to Iu or A/Gb mode in NMO II, the TIN indicates "GUTI", and the location area
of the current cell is the same as the stored location area, the MS shall start timer T3212, with a value set to the shorter
of the values of the remaining value of timer T3412, and the broadcast T3212 timeout value.

When the MS supporting N1 mode in MS operation modes A or B moves from NG-RAN coverage to GERAN
coverage, or from NG-RAN coverage to UTRAN coverage, the network operates in network operation mode II, the
location area of the current cell is the same as the stored location area, the broadcast value of T3212 does not indicate
"deactivated" and the T3212 has expired, the MS may intiate the periodic location updating procedure.

When a change of the broadcast T3212 timeout value has to be taken into account and the timer is running (at change of
the serving cell or, change of the broadcast value of T3212), the MS shall behave as follows: let t1 be the new T3212
timeout value and let t be the current timer value at the moment of the change to the new T3212 timeout value; then the
timer shall be restarted with the value t modulo t1.

When the mobile station is activated, or when a change of the broadcast T3212 timeout value has to be taken into
account and the timer is not running, the mobile station shall behave as follows: let t1 be the new T3212 timeout value,
the new timer shall be started at a value randomly, uniformly drawn between 0 and t1.


4.4.3          IMSI attach procedure
The IMSI attach procedure is the complement of the IMSI detach procedure (see subclause 4.3.4). It is used to indicate
the IMSI as active in the network.

In A/Gb mode and GERAN Iu mode, the network indicates whether the IMSI attach/detach procedures are required by
using the ATT flag which is broadcast in the L3-RR SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 3 message (see
3GPP TS 44.018 [84] subclause 10.5.2.11).




                                                             ETSI
3GPP TS 24.008 version 15.8.0 Release 15                  111                       ETSI TS 124 008 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


In UTRAN Iu mode, the network indicates whether the IMSI attach/detach procedures are required by using the ATT
flag which is included in the CS domain specific system information element (see subclause 10.5.1.12.2).

The IMSI attach procedure is invoked if the ATT flag indicates that the IMSI detach/attach procedures are required and
an IMSI is activated in a mobile station (i.e. activation of a mobile station with plug-in SIM/USIM, insertion of a card
in a card-operated mobile station etc.) within coverage area from the network or a mobile station with an IMSI activated
outside the coverage area enters the coverage area. The IMSI attach procedure is used only if the update status is U1
UPDATED and if the stored location area identification is the same as the one which is actually broadcasted on the
BCCH of the current serving cell.

In a shared network, the MS shall choose one of the PLMN identities as specified in 3GPP TS 23.122 [14]. The MS
shall use the IMSI attach procedure only if the update status is U1 UPDATED and the stored location area identification
is equal to the combination of the chosen PLMN identity and the LAC received on the BCCH. Otherwise a normal
location updating procedure (see subclause 4.4.1) is invoked independently of the ATT flag indication.

The IMSI attach procedure is performed by using the location updating procedure (see subclause 4.4.1). The location
updating type information element in the LOCATION UPDATING REQUEST message shall in this case indicate IMSI
attach.


4.4.4         Generic Location Updating procedure

4.4.4.1          Location updating initiation by the mobile station
Any timer used for triggering the location updating procedure (e.g. T3211, T3212) is stopped if running.

As no RR connection exists at the time when the location updating procedure has to be started, the MM sublayer within
the mobile station will request the RR sublayer to establish a RR connection and enter state WAIT FOR RR
CONNECTION (LOCATION UPDATE). The procedure for establishing an RR connection is described in
3GPP TS 44.018 [84] subclause 3.3 and 3GPP TS 25.331 [23c].

The mobile station initiates the location updating procedure by sending a LOCATION UPDATING REQUEST
message to the network, starts the timer T3210 and enters state LOCATION UPDATING INITIATED. The location
updating type information element shall indicate what kind of updating is requested.

If the MS is configured for "AttachWithIMSI" as specified in 3GPP TS 24.368 [135] or 3GPP TS 31.102 [112] and the
selected PLMN is neither the registered PLMN nor in the list of equivalent PLMNs, the MS shall include the IMSI in
the Mobile identity IE in the LOCATION UPDATING REQUEST message.

If the mobile station is configured to use CS fallback and SMS over SGs, or SMS over SGs only, and TIN indicates
"RAT-related TMSI" the mobile station shall set the TIN to "P-TMSI" unless the mobile station had already received
the EMM cause #18 during a combined attach procedure (see subclause 5.5.1.3.4.3 of 3GPP TS 24.301 [120]) or a
combined tracking area updating procedure (see subclause 5.5.3.3.4.3 of 3GPP TS 24.301 [120]) on the same PLMN,
but not disabled the E-UTRAN capability.

4.4.4.1a         Network Request for Additional mobile station Capability Information
In A/Gb mode, the network may initiate the classmark interrogation procedure, for example, to obtain further
information on the mobile station's encryption capabilities.

4.4.4.2          Identification request from the network
The network may initiate the identification procedure, e.g. if the network is unable to get the IMSI based on the TMSI
and LAI used as identification by the mobile station (see subclause 4.3.3).

4.4.4.3          Authentication by the network
The authentication procedure (see subclause 4.3.2) may be initiated by the network upon receipt of the LOCATION
UPDATING REQUEST message from the mobile station. (See the cases defined in 3GPP TS 42.009 [5]).

4.4.4.4           Security mode setting by the network
In A/Gb mode, the security mode setting procedure (see 3GPP TS 44.018 [84] subclause 3.4.7) may be initiated by the
network, e.g., if a new TMSI has to be allocated.

In Iu mode, the security mode control procedure (see 3GPP TS 25.331 [23c] and 3GPP TS 44.118 [111]) may be
initiated by the network, e.g., if a new TMSI has to be allocated.

4.4.4.5           Location Update Attempt Counter
To limit the number of consecutive unsuccessful location updating attempts, an location update attempt counter is used.
The location update attempt counter counts the number of consecutive unsuccessful location updating attempts.

The location update attempt counter shall be incremented as specified in subclause 4.4.4.9.

The location update attempt counter shall be reset when:

   -   the mobile station is powered on;

   -   a SIM/USIM is inserted;

   -   a location updating procedure is successfully completed;

   -   a location updating procedure is rejected with cause:

       a) #11, #12, #13, #15 or #25 (see subclause 4.4.4.7);

       b) #22 and T3346 value IE indicating neither zero nor deactivated (see subclause 4.4.4.7);

   - a normal or periodic routing area updating procedure or combined routing updating is not accepted by the
   network with cause #11, #12, #13, #15 or #25 (see subclause 4.7.5.1.4 and 4.7.5.2.4);

   - GPRS attach or combined GPRS attach procedure is not accepted by the network with cause #11, #12, #13, or
   #15 (see subclause 4.7.3.1.4 and 4.7.3.2.4);

   -   service request procedure is not accepted by the network with cause #12, #13, or #15 (see subclause 4.7.13.4);

   -   network initiated GPRS detach procedure is completed with cause #12, #13, or #15 (see subclause 4.7.4.2.2);

   -   combined GPRS attach or combined routing area updating procedure is successful for GPRS and non-GPRS
       services; or

   -   a new PLMN is selected.

and additionally when the mobile station is in the state MM IDLE sub-state ATTEMPTING to UPDATE:

   -   a new location area is entered;

   -   expiry of timer T3212;

   -   a location updating procedure is triggered by CM sublayer requests; or

   -   timer T3246 is started.

The location update attempt counter shall be used when deciding whether to re-attempt a location updating procedure
after expiry of timer T3211 as specified in subclause 4.4.4.9.

4.4.4.6           Location updating accepted by the network
If the location updating is accepted by the network a LOCATION UPDATING ACCEPT message is transferred to the
mobile station.

In case the identity confidentiality service is active (see subclauses 4.3.1 and 4.4.4.4), the TMSI reallocation may be
part of the location updating procedure. The TMSI allocated is then contained in the LOCATION UPDATING
ACCEPT message together with the location area identifier LAI. The network shall in this case start the supervision
timer T3250 as described in subclause 4.3.1.

In a shared network, if the MS is a network sharing supporting MS, the network shall indicate in the LAI the PLMN
identity of the CN operator that has accepted the location updating; if the MS is a network sharing non-supporting MS,
the network shall indicate the PLMN identity of the common PLMN (see 3GPP TS 23.251 [109]).

In a multi-operator core network (MOCN) with common GERAN, the network shall indicate in the LAI the common
PLMN identity (see 3GPP TS 23.251 [109]).

If the network wishes to prolong the RR connection to allow the mobile station to initiate MM connection establishment
(for example if the mobile station has indicated in the LOCATION UPDATING REQUEST that it has a follow-on
request pending) the network shall send "follow on proceed" in the LOCATION UPDATING ACCEPT and start timer
T3255.

If the mobile station has indicated "CS fallback mobile terminating call" in the LOCATION UPDATING REQUEST
message, the network shall maintain the RR connection for an implementation dependent duration to allow for mobile
terminating call establishment. If the mobile station has also indicated in the LOCATION UPDATING REQUEST
message that it has a follow-on request pending, it is implementation dependent whether the network proceeds with the
mobile terminating call establishment or allows for a mobile initiated MM connection establishment.

The mobile station receiving a LOCATION UPDATING ACCEPT message shall store the received location area
identification LAI, stop timer T3210, reset the location update attempt counter and set the update status in the
SIM/USIM to UPDATED. If the message contains an IMSI, the mobile station is not allocated any TMSI, and shall
delete any TMSI in the SIM/USIM accordingly. If the message contains a TMSI, the mobile station is allocated this
TMSI, and shall store this TMSI in the SIM/USIM and a TMSI REALLOCATION COMPLETE shall be returned to
the network. If neither IMSI nor TMSI is received in the LOCATION UPDATING ACCEPT message, the old TMSI if
any available shall be kept.

If the MS has initiated the location updating procedure due to manual CSG selection and receives a LOCATION
UPDATING ACCEPT message, and the MS sent the LOCATION UPDATING REQUEST message in a CSG cell, the
MS shall check if the CSG ID and associated PLMN identity of the cell are contained in the Allowed CSG list. If not,
the MS shall add that CSG ID and associated PLMN identity to the Allowed CSG list and the MS may add the HNB
Name (if provided by lower layers) to the Allowed CSG list if the HNB Name is present in neither the Operator CSG
list nor the Allowed CSG list.

If the LAI or PLMN identity contained in the LOCATION UPDATING ACCEPT message is a member of the list of
"forbidden location areas for regional provision of service", the list of "forbidden location areas for roaming" or the
"forbidden PLMN list" then such entries shall be deleted.

If the MS receives the LOCATION UPDATING ACCEPT message from a PLMN for which a PLMN-specific attempt
counter is maintained (see subclause 4.1.1.6A), then the MS shall reset this counter. If the MS maintains a counter for
"SIM/USIM considered invalid for non-GPRS services", then the MS shall reset this counter.

The network may also send a list of "equivalent PLMNs" in the LOCATION UPDATING ACCEPT message. Each
entry of the list contains a PLMN code (MCC+MNC). If the location updating procedure is initiated during a CS
fallback procedure and the network is configured to support the return to the last registered E-UTRAN PLMN after CS
fallback as specified in 3GPP TS 23.272 [133], and the PLMN identity which is provided as part of the RAI contained
in the ROUTING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message differs from the last registered E-UTRAN PLMN identity, the
network shall include the last registered E-UTRAN PLMN identity in the list of "equivalent PLMNs" in the
LOCATION UPDATING ACCEPT message.

   NOTE 1: The network can determine a location updating procedure is initiated during a CS fallback procedure as
           specified in 3GPP TS 23.272 [133].

   NOTE 2: The last registered E-UTRAN PLMN identity can be derived by the network as specified in
           3GPP TS 23.272 [133].

The mobile station shall store the list, as provided by the network, except that any PLMN code that is already in the
"forbidden PLMN list" shall be removed from the "equivalent PLMNs" list before it is stored by the mobile station. If
the mobile station is supporting S1 mode, it shall also remove any PLMN code that is already in the list of "forbidden
PLMNs for GPRS service" before storing the list. In addition the mobile station shall add to the stored list the PLMN
code of the registered PLMN that sent the list. All PLMNs in the stored list shall be regarded as equivalent to each other
for PLMN selection, cell selection/re-selection and handover. The stored list in the mobile station shall be replaced on
each occurrence of the LOCATION UPDATING ACCEPT message. If no list is contained in the message, then the
stored list in the mobile station shall be deleted. The list shall be stored in the mobile station while switched off so that
it can be used for PLMN selection after switch on.

After that, the mobile station shall act according to the presence of the "Follow-on proceed" information element in the
LOCATION UPDATING ACCEPT; if this element is present and the mobile station has a CM application request
pending, it shall send a CM SERVICE REQUEST to the network and proceed as in subclause 4.5.1.1. Otherwise, it
shall start timer T3240 and enter state WAIT FOR NETWORK COMMAND.

Furthermore, the network may grant authorisation for the mobile station to use GSM-Cordless Telephony System (CTS)
in the Location Area and its immediate neighbourhood. The mobile should memorise this permission in non-volatile
memory. If the "CTS permission" IE is not present in the message, the mobile is not authorised to use GSM-CTS, and
shall accordingly delete any memorised permission.

   NOTE 3: The interaction between CTS and GPRS procedures are not yet defined.

The network may also send a Local Emergency Numbers List with local emergency numbers in the LOCATION
UPDATING ACCEPT, by including the Emergency Number List IE. The mobile equipment shall store the Local
Emergency Numbers List, as provided by the network. The Local Emergency Numbers List stored in the mobile
equipment shall be replaced on each receipt of the Emergency Number List IE. The received Local Emergency
Numbers List shall be provided to the upper layers.

The emergency number(s) received in the Emergency Number List IE are valid only in networks in the same country as
the cell on which this IE is received. If no list is contained in the LOCATION UPDATING ACCEPT message, then the
stored Local Emergency Numbers List in the mobile equipment shall be kept, except if the mobile equipment has
successfully registered to a PLMN in a country different from that of the PLMN that sent the Local Emergency
Numbers List.

The mobile equipment shall use the stored Local Emergency Numbers Lt of emergency numbers received from the
network in addition to the emergency numbers stored on the SIM/USIM or ME to detect that the number dialled is an
emergency number.

   NOTE 4: The mobile equipment may use the Local Emergency Numbers List to assist the end user in determining
           whether the dialled number is intended for an emergency service or for another destination, e.g. a local
           directory service. The possible interactions with the end user are implementation specific.

   NOTE 5: An MS that supports procedures specified in 3GPP TS 24.302 [156], can get additional local emergency
           numbers through those procedures, which can be used based on operator policy (see
           3GPP TS 24.302 [156]) to detect that the number dialled is an emergency number.

The Local Emergency Numbers List shall be deleted at switch off and removal of the SIM/USIM. The mobile
equipment shall be able to store up to ten local emergency numbers received from the network.

4.4.4.7          Location updating not accepted by the network
If the location updating cannot be accepted, the network sends a LOCATION UPDATING REJECT message to the
mobile station. The mobile station receiving a LOCATION UPDATING REJECT message containing a reject cause
other than MM cause value #25 or the message is integrity protected, shall stop the timer T3210, store the reject cause,
start the timer T3240, enter state LOCATION UPDATING REJECTED, await the release of the RR connection
triggered by the network, and for all causes except #12, #15, #22 and #25 deletes the list of "equivalent PLMNs".

If the LOCATION UPDATING REJECT message containing the MM cause value #25 was received without integrity
protection, then the MS shall discard the message.

If the location updating is rejected due to general NAS level mobility management congestion control, the network shall
set the MM cause value to #22 "congestion" and assign a back-off timer T3246 (see 3GPP TS 23.012 [140]).

Upon the release of the RR connection, the mobile station shall take the following actions depending on the stored
reject cause:

   # 2:   (IMSI unknown in HLR);

   # 3:   (Illegal MS); or

   # 6:   (Illegal ME).

       The mobile station shall set the update status to ROAMING NOT ALLOWED (and store it in the SIM/USIM
       according to subclause 4.1.2.2), and delete any TMSI, stored LAI and ciphering key sequence number and shall
       consider the SIM/USIM as invalid for non-GPRS services until switch-off or the SIM/USIM is removed or the

      timer T3245 expires as described in subclause 4.1.1.6. If the message has been successfully integrity checked by
      the lower layers and the MS maintains a counter for "SIM/USIM considered invalid for non-GPRS services",
      then the MS shall set this counter to MS implementation-specific maximum value.

   # 11: (PLMN not allowed);

      The mobile station shall delete any LAI, TMSI and ciphering key sequence number stored in the SIM/USIM,
      reset the location update attempt counter, and set the update status to ROAMING NOT ALLOWED (and store it
      in the SIM/USIM according to subclause 4.1.2.2). The mobile station shall store the PLMN identity in the
      "forbidden PLMN list" and if the MS is configured to use timer T3245 (see 3GPP TS 24.368 [135] or
      3GPP TS 31.102 [112]) then the MS shall start timer T3245 and proceed as described in subclause 4.1.1.6. If the
      message has been successfully integrity checked by the lower layers and the MS maintains a PLMN-specific
      attempt counter for that PLMN, then the MS shall set this counter to the MS implementation-specific maximum
      value.

      The MS shall perform a PLMN selection when back to the MM IDLE state according to 3GPP TS 23.122 [14].

      An MS in GAN mode shall request a PLMN list in GAN (see 3GPP TS 44.318 [76b]) prior to performing a
      PLMN selection from this list according to 3GPP TS 23.122 [14].

   # 12: (Location Area not allowed);

      The mobile station shall delete any LAI, TMSI and ciphering key sequence number stored in the SIM/USIM,
      reset the location update attempt counter, and set the update status to ROAMING NOT ALLOWED (and store it
      in the SIM/USIM according to subclause 4.1.2.2).

      The mobile station shall store the LAI in the list of "forbidden location areas for regional provision of service".

      The MS shall perform a cell selection when back to the MM IDLE state according to 3GPP TS 43.022 [82] and
      3GPP TS 25.304 [98].

   NOTE 1: The cell selection procedure is not applicable for an MS in GAN mode.

   # 13: (Roaming not allowed in this location area).

      The mobile station shall reset the location update attempt counter, and set the update status to ROAMING NOT
      ALLOWED (and store it in the SIM/USIM according to subclause 4.1.2.2).

      The mobile station shall store the LAI in the list of "forbidden location areas for roaming".

      The mobile station shall perform a PLMN selection instead of a cell selection when back to the MM IDLE state
      according to 3GPP TS 23.122 [14].

      An MS in GAN mode shall request a PLMN list in GAN (see 3GPP TS 44.318 [76b]) prior to performing a
      PLMN selection from this list according to 3GPP TS 23.122 [14].

   # 15: (No Suitable Cells In Location Area).

      The mobile station shall reset the location update attempt counter, set the update status to ROAMING NOT
      ALLOWED (and store it in the SIM/USIM according to subclause 4.1.2.2).

      The mobile station shall store the LAI in the list of "forbidden location areas for roaming".

      The mobile station shall search for a suitable cell in another location area or a tracking area according to
      3GPP TS 43.022 [82] and 3GPP TS 25.304 [98] or 3GPP TS 36.304 [121].

   NOTE 2: The cell selection procedure is not applicable for an MS in GAN mode.

   # 22: (Congestion).

      If the T3246 value IE is present in the LOCATION UPDATING REJECT message and the value indicates that
      this timer is neither zero nor deactivated, the mobile station shall proceed as described below, otherwise it shall
      be considered as an abnormal case and the behaviour of the MS for this case is specified in subclause 4.4.4.9.

       The mobile station shall abort the location updating procedure, reset the location update attempt counter, set the
       MM update status to U2 NOT UPDATED and change to state MM IDLE sub-state ATTEMPTING TO
       UPDATE.

       The MS shall stop timer T3246 if it is running.

       If the LOCATION UPDATING REJECT message is integrity protected, the mobile station shall start timer
       T3246 with the value provided in the T3246 value IE.

       If the LOCATION UPDATING REJECT message is not integrity protected, the mobile station shall start timer
       T3246 with a random value from the default range specified in table 11.1.

       The mobile station stays in the current serving cell and applies the normal cell reselection process. The MM
       connection establishment is started, if still necessary, when timer T3246 expires or is stopped.

   # 25: (Not authorized for this CSG ).

       Cause #25 is only applicable in UTRAN Iu mode and when received from a CSG cell. Other cases are
       considered as abnormal cases and the specification of the mobile station behaviour is given in subclause 4.4.4.9.

       The MS shall reset the location update attempt counter, and set the update status to ROAMING NOT
       ALLOWED (and store it in the SIM/USIM according to subclause 4.1.2.2).

       If the CSG ID and associated PLMN identity of the cell where the MS has sent the LOCATION UPDATING
       REQUEST message are contained in the Allowed CSG list stored in the MS, the MS shall remove the entry
       corresponding to this CSG ID and associated PLMN identity from the Allowed CSG list.

       If the CSG ID and associated PLMN identity of the cell where the MS has sent the LOCATION UPDATING
       REQUEST message are contained in the Operator CSG list, the MS shall proceed as specified in 3GPP TS
       23.122 [14] subclause 3.1A.

       The MS shall search for a suitable cell according to 3GPP TS 43.022 [82] and 3GPP TS 25.304 [98].

Other values are considered as abnormal cases and the specification of the mobile station behaviour in those cases is
given in subclause 4.4.4.9.

4.4.4.8          Release of RR connection after location updating
When the Location updating procedure is finished (see subclauses 4.4.4.6 and 4.4.4.7) the mobile station shall (except
in the case where the mobile has a follow-on CM application request pending and has received the follow-on proceed
indication, see subclause 4.4.4.6) set timer T3240 and enter the state WAIT FOR NETWORK COMMAND, expecting
the release of the RR connection. The network may decide to keep the RR connection for network initiated
establishment of a MM connection, or to allow for mobile initiated MM connection establishment.

Any release of the RR connection shall be initiated by the network according to subclause 3.5 in 3GPP TS 44.018 [84],
and 3GPP TS 25.331 [23c]. If the RR connection is not released within a given time controlled by the timer T3240, the
mobile station shall abort the RR connection. In both cases, either after a RR connection release triggered from the
network side or after a RR connection abort requested by the MS-side, the MS shall return to state MM IDLE.

At transition to state MM IDLE, substates NORMAL SERVICE or RECEIVING GROUP CALL (NORMAL
SERVICE) or ATTEMPTING TO UPDATE either timer T3212 or timer T3211 is started as described in
subclause 4.4.4.9, or, timer T3246 is started as described in subclauses 4.4.4.7, 4.4.4.9 and 4.5.1.1.

If the MS receives the "Extended wait time" for CS domain from the lower layers when no location updating or CM
service request procedure is ongoing, the MS shall ignore the "Extended wait time".

4.4.4.9          Abnormal cases on the mobile station side
The different abnormal cases that can be identified are the following:

   a) Access barred because of access class control or EAB

       The location updating procedure is not started. The mobile station stays in the current serving cell and applies
       normal cell reselection process. The procedure is started as soon as possible and if still necessary (when the
       barred state is ended or because of a cell change).



                                                          ETSI
3GPP TS 24.008 version 15.8.0 Release 15                  117                        ETSI TS 124 008 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


   b) The answer to random access is an IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT REJECT message (A/Gb mode only)

      The location updating is not started. The mobile station stays in the chosen cell and applies normal cell selection
      process. The waiting timer T3122 is reset when a cell change occurs. The procedure is started as soon as possible
      after T3122 timeout if still necessary.

   c) Random access failure (A/Gb mode only)

      Timer T3213 is started. When it expires the procedure is attempted again if still necessary.

   NOTE 1: As specified in 3GPP TS 45.008 [34], a cell reselection then takes place, with return to the cell inhibited
           for 5 seconds if there is at least one other suitable cell. Typically the selection process will take the
           mobile station back to the cell where the random access failed after 5 seconds.

      If at the expiry of timer T3213 a new cell has not been selected due to the lack of valid information (see
      3GPP TS 45.008 [34]), the mobile station may as an option delay the repeated attempt for up to 8 seconds to
      allow cell re-selection to take place. In this case the procedure is attempted as soon as a new cell has been
      selected or the mobile station has concluded that no other cell can be selected.

      If random access failure occurs for two successive random access attempts for location updating the mobile
          station proceeds as specified below.

   d) RR connection failure

      The procedure is aborted and the mobile station proceeds as specified below.

   e) T3210 timeout

      The procedure is aborted, the RR connection is aborted and the MS proceeds as specified below.

   f) RR release without "Extended Wait Time" received from lower layers before the normal end of procedure

      The procedure is aborted and the mobile station proceeds as specified below, except in the following
      implementation option case f.1.

   f.1)RR release in Iu mode (i.e. RRC connection release) with, for example, cause "Normal", "User inactivity" or
       "Directed signalling connection re-establishment" (see 3GPP TS 25.331 [23c] and 3GPP TS 44.118 [111])

      The location updating procedure shall be initiated again, if the following conditions apply:

          i) The original location updating procedure was initiated over an existing RRC connection; and

          ii) No SECURITY MODE COMMAND message and no Non-Access Stratum (NAS) messages relating to
          the CS signalling connection (e.g. CS authentication procedures, see subclause 4.3.2), were received after the
          LOCATION UPDATING REQUEST message was transmitted.

   NOTE 2: The RRC connection release cause that triggers the re-initiation of the location updating procedure is
           implementation specific.

   g) Location updating reject, other causes than those treated in subclause 4.4.4.7, and cases of MM cause values #22
      and #25, if considered as abnormal cases according to subclause 4.4.4.7

      Upon reception of the cause codes #22, # 95, # 96, # 97, # 99 and # 111 the MS should set the location update
      attempt counter to 4. The MS waits for release of the RR connection as specified in subclause 4.4.4.8.

      The MS shall proceed as described below.

   h) RR connection establishment failure without "Extended Wait Time" received from lower layers (Iu mode only)

      The procedure is aborted and the mobile station proceeds as specified below.

   NOTE 3: Case h) covers all cases when the signalling connection cannot be established, including random access
           failure and access reject. As the RRC protocol has error specific retransmission mechanisms (see
           3GPP TS 25.331 [23c]), there is no need to distinguish between the different error cases within MM.

   i) "Extended wait time" for CS domain from the lower layers

       The MS shall abort the location updating procedure and stop timer T3210 if still running.

       If the LOCATION UPDATING REQUEST message contained the low priority indicator set to "MS is
       configured for NAS signalling low priority", the MS shall start timer T3246 with the "Extended wait time" value
       and reset the location update attempt counter.

       In other cases the MS shall ignore the "Extended wait time".

       Additionally, the MS shall set the MM update status to U2 NOT UPDATED and change to state MM IDLE sub-
       state ATTEMPTING TO UPDATE. The MS stays in the current serving cell and applies normal cell reselection
       process. The location updating procedure is started, if still necessary, when timer T3246 expires or is stopped,
       and the MS proceeds as specified below.

   j) Timer T3246 is running

       The location updating procedure shall not be initiated unless the MS is establishing an emergency call or the MS
       is an MS configured to use AC11 – 15 in selected PLMN. The MS stays in the current serving cell and applies
       normal cell reselection process. The location updating procedure is started, if still necessary, when timer T3246
       expires or is stopped.

In cases d) to i) (except in the case f.1 and except in the case i) when timer T3246 is started) above, and, for repeated
failures as defined in c) above, the mobile station proceeds as follows. Timer T3210 is stopped if still running. The RR
Connection is aborted in case of timer T3210 timeout. The location update attempt counter is incremented. The next
actions depend on the Location Area Identities (stored and received from the BCCH of the current serving cell) and the
value of the location update attempt counter.

   – the update status is UPDATED, and the stored LAI is equal to the one received on the BCCH from the current
     serving cell and the location update attempt counter is smaller than 4:

       The mobile station shall keep the update status to UPDATED, the MM IDLE sub-state after the RR connection
       release is NORMAL SERVICE. The mobile station shall memorize the location updating type used in the
       location updating procedure. It shall start timer T3211 when the RR connection is released. When timer T3211
       or T3246 expires the location updating procedure is triggered again with the memorized location updating type;

   – either the update status is different from UPDATED, or the stored LAI is different from the one received on the
     BCCH from the current serving cell, or the location update attempt counter is greater or equal to 4:

       When the RR connection is released the mobile station shall delete any LAI, TMSI, ciphering key sequence
       number stored in the SIM/USIM, and set the update status to NOT UPDATED. A mobile station which is not a
       GPRS MS shall also delete the list of equivalent PLMNs. The mobile station shall enter the MM IDLE sub-state
       ATTEMPTING TO UPDATE (see subclause 4.2.2.2 for the subsequent actions) or optionally the MM IDLE
       sub-state PLMN SEARCH (see subclause 4.2.1.2) in order to perform a PLMN selection according to
       3GPP TS 23.122 [14]. If the location update attempt counter is smaller than 4, the mobile station shall memorize
       that timer T3211 is to be started when the RR connection is released, otherwise it shall memorize that timer
       T3212 is to be started when the RR connection is released.

4.4.4.10         Abnormal cases on the network side
   a) RR connection failure

If a RR connection failure occurs during a common procedure integrated with the location updating procedure, the
behaviour of the network should be according to the description of that common procedure.

If a RR connection failure occurs when a common procedure does not exist, the location updating procedure towards
the mobile station should be aborted.

   b) protocol error

If the LOCATION UPDATING REQUEST message is received with a protocol error, the network should, if possible,
return a LOCATION UPDATING REJECT message with one of the following Reject causes:

       #96:   Mandatory information element error

       #99:   Information element non-existent or not implemented

4.4.6         Void

4.4.7         eCall inactivity procedure
The eCall inactivity procedure is applicable only to an eCall only mobile station (as determined by information
configured in USIM). The procedure shall be started when:

   -   the mobile station is in any MM Idle state except NO IMSI, NO CELL AVAILABLE or PLMN SEARCH;

   -   the mobile station is in GMM-NULL or GMM-DEREGISTERED state; and

   -   one of the following conditions applies:

       -   timer T3242 expires or is found to have already expired and T3243 is not running;

       -   timer T3243 expires or is found to have already expired and T3242 is not running; or

       -   timer T3242 and timer T3243 expire or are found to have already expired.

The mobile station shall then stop other running timers (e.g. T3211, T3212, T3213) and shall perform the IMSI detach
procedure if required by the serving network and if the update state is U1. The mobile station then enters MM Idle
eCALL INACTIVE state and the mobile station shall delete any LAI, TMSI, ciphering key sequence number stored in
the SIM/USIM and set the update state to U4 Updating Disabled.

While in eCALL INACTIVE state, the mobile station maintains awareness of a potential serving cell in a potential
serving network but initiates no MM signalling with the network and ignores any paging requests.

The mobile station shall leave eCALL INACTIVE state only when one of the following events occur:

   -   if the SIM or USIM is removed, the mobile station enters the NO IMSI state;

   -   if coverage is lost, the mobile station enters PLMN SEARCH state;

   -   if the mobile station is deactivated (e.g. powered off) by the user: the mobile station enters the NULL state;

   -   if there is a CM request for an emergency services call: the mobile station should follow the procedure for return
       to state MM-IDLE in subclause 4.2.3 and attempt a location update. The MS then uses the MM and CM
       procedures to establish the emergency call at the earliest opportunity; or

   NOTE 1: If an eCall only device has not successfully completed a location update procedure, PSAP callback will
           not be possible due to its calling line identity being unavailable at the PSAP.

   NOTE 2: An eCall only device uses the CS domain to originate an emergency services call when in A/Gb or Iu
           mode, even if the device is capable of eCall over IMS.

   -   if there is a CM request for a call to an HPLMN designated non-emergency MSISDN for the purpose of
       accessing test and terminal reconfiguration services: the mobile station follows the procedure for return to state

       MM-IDLE in subclause 4.2.3 and attempts a normal location update. Once this is complete, further MM and CM
       procedures are used to establish the non-emergency call.

   NOTE 3: An eCall only device uses the CS domain to originate a call to an HPLMN designated non-emergency
           MSISDN for the purpose of accessing test and terminal reconfiguration services when in A/Gb or Iu
           mode, even if the device is capable of eCall over IMS.


4.5           Connection management sublayer service provision
The concept of MM connection is introduced in this subclause. This concept is mainly a descriptive tool: The
establishment of an MM connection by the network can be local (i.e. it is achieved by the transmission of the first CM
layer message and without the transmission of any MM layer messages) or can be achieved by the transmission of a CM
SERVICE PROMPT message (eg. in the case of certain ring back services). The release of an MM connection by the
network or by the mobile station is always local, i.e. these purposes can be achieved without sending any MM messages
over the radio interface. (On the contrary, establishment of an MM connection by the mobile station requires the
sending of MM messages over the radio interface. An exception is VGCS, where an MM connection will be established
as result of an uplink access procedure (see subclause 3.7.2.1.1in 3GPP TS 44.018 [84]).)

The Mobility Management (MM) sublayer is providing connection management services to the different entities of the
upper Connection management (CM) sublayer (see 3GPP TS 24.007 [20]). It offers to a CM entity the possibility to use
an MM connection for the exchange of information with its peer entity. An MM connection is established and released
on request from a CM entity. Different CM entities communicate with their peer entity using different MM connections.
Several MM connections may be active at the same time.

An MM connection requires an RR connection. All simultaneous MM connections for a given mobile station use the
same RR connection.

In the following subclauses, the procedures for establishing, re-establishing, maintaining, and releasing an MM
connection are described, usually separately for the mobile station and the network side.


4.5.1         MM connection establishment

4.5.1.1          MM connection establishment initiated by the mobile station
Upon request of a CM entity to establish an MM connection the MM sublayer first decides whether to accept, delay, or
reject this request:

   -   An MM connection establishment may only be initiated by the mobile station when the following conditions are
       fulfilled:

       -   Its update status is UPDATED.

       -   The MM sublayer is in one of the states MM IDLE, RR CONNECTION RELEASE NOT ALLOWED or
           MM connection active but not in MM connection active (Group call).

       An exception from this general rule exists for emergency calls (see subclause 4.5.1.5). A further exception is
       defined in the following clause.

   -   If an MM specific procedure is running at the time the request from the CM sublayer is received, and the
       LOCATION UPDATING REQUEST message has been sent, the request will either be rejected or delayed,
       depending on implementation, until the MM specific procedure is finished and, provided that the network has
       not sent a "follow-on proceed" indication, the RR connection is released. If the LOCATION UPDATING
       REQUEST message has not been sent, the mobile station may include a "follow-on request" indicator in the
       message. The mobile station shall then delay the request until the MM specific procedure is completed, when it
       may be given the opportunity by the network to use the RR connection: see subclause 4.4.4.6.

In order to establish an MM connection, the mobile station proceeds as follows:

   a) If no RR connection exists, the MM sublayer requests the RR sublayer to establish an RR connection and enters
      MM sublayer state WAIT FOR RR CONNECTION (MM CONNECTION). This request contains an
      establishment cause and a CM SERVICE REQUEST message. When the establishment of an RR connection is
      indicated by the RR sublayer, the MM sublayer of the mobile station starts timer T3230, gives an indication to

3GPP TS 24.008 version 15.8.0 Release 15                   121                        ETSI TS 124 008 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


       the CM entity that requested the MM connection establishment, and enters MM sublayer state WAIT FOR
       OUTGOING MM CONNECTION.

   b) If an RR connection is available, the MM sublayer of the mobile station sends a CM SERVICE REQUEST
      message to the network, starts timer T3230, stops and resets timer T3241, gives an indication to the CM entity
      that requested the MM connection establishment, and enters:

       -   MM sublayer state WAIT FOR OUTGOING MM CONNECTION, if no MM connection is active;

       -   MM sublayer state WAIT FOR ADDITIONAL OUTGOING MM CONNECTION, if at least one MM
           connection is active;

       -   If an RR connection exists but the mobile station is in the state WAIT FOR NETWORK COMMAND then
           any requests from the CM layer that are received will either be rejected or delayed until this state is left.

   c) Only applicable for mobile stations supporting VGCS talking:

       If a mobile station which is in the MM sublayer state MM IDLE, service state RECEIVING GROUP CALL
       (NORMAL SERVICE), receives a request from the GCC sublayer to perform an uplink access, the MM sublayer
       requests the RR sublayer to perform an uplink access procedure and enters MM sublayer state WAIT FOR RR
       CONNECTION (GROUP TRANSMIT MODE).

       When a successful uplink access is indicated by the RR sublayer, the MM sublayer of the mobile station gives an
       indication to the GCC sublayer and enters MM sublayer state MM CONNECTION ACTIVE (GROUP
       TRANSMIT MODE).

       When an uplink access reject is indicated by the RR sublayer, the MM sublayer of the mobile station gives an
       indication to the GCC sublayer and enters the MM sublayer state MM IDLE, service state RECEIVING GROUP
       CALL (NORMAL SERVICE).

       In the network, if an uplink access procedure is performed, the RR sublayer in the network provides an
       indication to the MM sublayer together with the mobile subscriber identity received in the TALKER
       INDICATION message. The network shall then enter the MM sublayer state MM CONNECTION ACTIVE
       (GROUP TRANSMIT MODE).

   d) When the MS is IMSI attached for CS services via EMM combined procedures, as described in
      3GPP TS 24.301 [120], and the MS is camping on an E-UTRAN cell, and if T3246 is not running, the MM
      sublayer requests EMM to initiate a service request procedure for CS fallback. The MM connection
      establishment is delayed until the MS changes to a GERAN or UTRAN cell.

       If the MS enters a GERAN or UTRAN cell, then the MS shall initiate the MM connection establishment and
       send a CM SERVICE REQUEST message. The MS shall include the Additional update parameters information
       element indicating "CS fallback mobile originating call". If the MS determines that it is in a different location
       area than the stored location area, the MS shall first initiate a normal location updating procedure regardless of
       Network Mode of Operation. If the location area of the current cell is not available, the MS may initiate a normal
       location updating procedure directly. The MM connection establishment is delayed until successful completion
       of the normal location updating procedure. Additionally the MS performs routing area updating as specified in
       subclause 4.7.5. If the normal location updating procedure is initiated, the MS shall indicate the "follow-on
       request pending", shall include the Additional update parameters information element indicating"CS fallback
       mobile originating call", and shall not include the MS network feature support information element in the
       LOCATION UPDATING REQUEST message.

In case a, b and d, the CM SERVICE REQUEST message contains the:

   -   mobile identity according to subclause 10.5.1.4;

   -   mobile station classmark 2;

   -   ciphering key sequence number; and

   -   CM service type identifying the requested type of transaction (e.g. mobile originating call establishment,
       emergency call establishment, short message service, supplementary service activation, location services).

A MS supporting eMLPP may optionally include a priority level in the CM SERVICE REQUEST message.

For MM connection establishment involving a shared GERAN network in A/Gb mode, if the MS is a GERAN network
sharing supporting MS, the chosen PLMN identity shall be indicated to the GERAN in the CM SERVICE REQUEST
message using the Skip Indicator IE as specified in subclause 10.3.1.

A collision may occur when a CM layer message is received by the mobile station in MM sublayer state WAIT FOR
OUTGOING MM CONNECTION or in WAIT FOR ADDITIONAL OUTGOING MM CONNECTION. In this case
the MM sublayer in the MS shall establish a new MM connection for the incoming CM message as specified in
subclause 4.5.1.3.

Upon receiving a CM SERVICE REQUEST message, the network shall analyse its content. The type of semantic
analysis may depend on other on going MM connection(s). Depending on the type of request and the current status of
the RR connection, the network may start any of the MM common procedures and RR procedures.

In A/Gb mode, the network may initiate the classmark interrogation procedure, for example, to obtain further
information on the mobile station's encryption capabilities.

The identification procedure (see subclause 4.3.3) may be invoked for instance if a TMSI provided by the mobile
station is not recognized.

The network may invoke the authentication procedure (see subclause 4.3.2) depending on the CM service type.

In A/Gb mode, the network decides also if the ciphering mode setting procedure shall be invoked (see subclause 3.4.7
in 3GPP TS 44.018 [84]).

In Iu mode, the network decides also if the security mode control procedure shall be invoked (see
3GPP TS 25.331 [23c] and 3GPP TS 44.118 [111]).

   NOTE 1: If the CM_SERVICE_REQUEST message contains a priority level the network may use this to perform
           queuing and pre-emption as defined in 3GPP TS 23.067 [88].

In A/Gb mode, the MS shall consider the MM connection establishment to be completed when:

   -   receiving an indication from the RR sublayer that the ciphering mode setting procedure is completed; or

   -   receiving a CM SERVICE ACCEPT message.

In Iu mode, the MS shall consider the MM connection establishment to be completed when

   -   receiving an indication from the RR sublayer that the security mode control procedure is completed, except for
       the case when it is the first security mode control procedure after successful inter-system change received in MM
       sublayer state WAIT FOR ADDITIONAL OUTGOING MM CONNECTION; or

   -   receiving a CM SERVICE ACCEPT message.

The procedures in subclause 4.1.1.1.1 shall always have precedence over this subclause.

In Iu mode, during a MM connection establishment for all services, except for emergency call (see subclause 4.1.1.1.1),
the security mode control procedure with activation of integrity protection shall be invoked by the network unless
integrity protection is already started (see subclause 4.1.1.1.1).

The MM connection establishment is completed, timer T3230 shall be stopped, the CM entity that requested the MM
connection shall be informed, and MM sublayer state MM CONNECTION ACTIVE is entered. The MM connection is
considered to be active.

If the service request cannot be accepted, the network returns a CM SERVICE REJECT message to the mobile station.

The reject cause information element (see subclause 10.5.3.6 and annex G) indicates the reason for rejection. The
following cause values may apply:

       #4: IMSI unknown in VLR

       #6: Illegal ME

       #17:   Network failure

       #22:   Congestion

       #25    Not authorized for this CSG

       #32:   Service option not supported

       #33:   Requested service option not subscribed

       #34:   Service option temporarily out of order

If the service request is rejected due to general NAS level mobility management congestion control, the network shall
set the MM cause value to #22 "congestion" and assign a back-off timer T3246 (see 3GPP TS 23.012 [140]).

If no other MM connection is active, the network may start the RR connection release (see subclause 3.5 of
3GPP TS 44.018 [84] (A/Gb mode only), 3GPP TS 25.331 [23c] (UTRAN Iu mode only), or in 3GPP TS 44.118 [111]
(GERAN Iu mode only) when the CM SERVICE REJECT message is sent.

If a CM SERVICE REJECT message is received by the mobile station, timer T3230 shall be stopped, the requesting
CM sublayer entity informed. Then the mobile station shall proceed as follows:

   -   If the cause value is not #4 or #6 or #25 received from a CSG cell and the MS is in UTRAN Iu mode, the MM
       sublayer returns to the previous state (the state where the request was received). Other MM connections shall not
       be affected by the CM SERVICE REJECT message.

   -   If cause value #4 is received, the mobile station aborts any MM connection, deletes any TMSI, LAI and
       ciphering key sequence number in the SIM/USIM, changes the update status to NOT UPDATED (and stores it in
       the SIM/USIM according to subclause 4.1.2.2), and enters the MM sublayer state WAIT FOR NETWORK
       COMMAND. If subsequently the RR connection is released or aborted, this will force the mobile station to
       initiate a normal location updating). Whether the CM request shall be memorized during the location updating
       procedure, is a choice of implementation.

   -   If cause value #6 is received, the mobile station aborts any MM connection, deletes any TMSI, LAI and
       ciphering key sequence number in the SIM/USIM, changes the update status to ROAMING NOT ALLOWED
       (and stores it in the SIM/USIM according to subclause 4.1.2.2), and enters the MM sublayer state WAIT FOR
       NETWORK COMMAND. The mobile station shall consider the SIM/USIM as invalid for non-GPRS services
       until switch-off or the SIM/USIM is removed. If the message has been successfully integrity checked by the
       lower layers and the MS maintains a counter for "SIM/USIM considered invalid for non-GPRS services", then
       the MS shall set this counter to MS implementation-specific maximum value.

   -   If cause value #22 is received, the T3246 value IE is present in the CM SERVICE REJECT message and the
       value indicates that this timer is neither zero nor deactivated, the MS shall check whether the CM SERVICE
       REJECT message with cause #22 is integrity protected and shall stop timer T3246 if it is running. If the message
       is integrity protected, the MS shall start timer T3246 with the value provided in the T3246 value IE. Otherwise,
       the MS shall start timer T3246 with a random value from the default range specified in table 11.1.The MS stays
       in the current serving cell and applies normal cell reselection process. The service request procedure may be
       started by CM layer, if it is still necessary, when timer T3246 expires or is stopped.

       If cause value #22 is received, the T3246 value IE is not present in the CM SERVICE REJECT message or if the
       T3246 value IE the value indicates that this timer is zero or deactivated, the same actions as on timer expiry in
       subclause 4.5.1.2 shall be taken by the mobile station.

   -   If cause value #25 is received from a CSG cell and the MS is in UTRAN Iu mode, the MS shall check whether
       the CM SERVICE REJECT message with cause #25 is integrity protected. If the message is not integrity
       protected, the MS shall discard the message. Otherwise, the MS shall abort any MM connection, remove the
       entry corresponding to the CSG ID and associated PLMN identity of the cell where the MS has sent the CM
       SERVICE REQUEST message from the Allowed CSG list if the CSG ID and associated PLMN identity are
       contained in the Allowed CSG list, and enter the MM sublayer state WAIT FOR NETWORK COMMAND. If
       the CSG ID and associated PLMN identity of the cell where the MS has sent the CM SERVICE REQUEST
       message is contained in the Operator CSG list, the MS shall proceed as specified in 3GPP TS 23.122 [14]
       subclause 3.1A. Subsequently, after the RR connection is released or aborted, the MS applies normal cell
       reselection process.

       If cause value #25 is received and the cell is not a CSG cell or the MS is not in UTRAN Iu mode, the MS shall
       discard the CM SERVICE REJECT message.

4.5.1.2          Abnormal cases
Mobile station side:

   a) RR connection failure without "Extended Wait Time" received from lower layers or IMSI deactivation

       If an RR connection failure occurs, except in the following implementation option case a.1, or the IMSI is
       deactivated during the establishment of an MM connection, the MM connection establishment is aborted, timers
       T3230 is stopped, and an indication is given to the CM entity that requested the MM connection establishment.
       This shall be treated as a rejection for establishment of the new MM connection, and the MM sublayer shall
       release all active MM connections.

   a.1) RR connection failure in Iu mode (i.e. RRC connection release) with, for example, cause "Normal", "User
       inactivity" or "Directed signalling connection re-establishment" (see 3GPP TS 25.331 [23c] and
       3GPP TS 44.118 [111])

       The MM connection establishment procedure shall be initiated again, if the following conditions apply:

       i) The original MM connection establishment was initiated over an existing RRC connection; and

       ii) No SECURITY MODE COMMAND message and no Non-Access Stratum (NAS) messages relating to the
           CS signalling connection (e.g. CS authentication procedures, see subclause 4.3.2), were received after the
           CM SERVICE REQUEST message was transmitted.

   NOTE 1: The RRC connection release cause that triggers the re-initiation of the MM connection establishment
           procedure is implementation specific.

   b) T3230 expiry

       If T3230 expires (i.e. no response is given but a RR connection is available) the MM connection establishment is
       aborted and the requesting CM sublayer is informed. If no other MM connection exists then the mobile station
       shall proceed as described in subclause 4.5.3.1 for release of the RR connection. Otherwise the mobile station
       shall return to the MM sublayer state where the request of an MM connection was received, i.e. to MM sublayer
       state MM connection active. Other ongoing MM connections (if any) shall not be affected.

   c) Reject cause values #95, #96, #97, #99, #100, #111 received

       The same actions as on timer expiry shall be taken by the mobile station.

   d) Random access failure or RR connection establishment failure without "Extended Wait Time" received from
      lower layers

       If the mobile station detects a random access failure or RR connection establishment failure during the
       establishment of an MM connection, it aborts the MM connection establishment and gives an indication to the
       CM entity that requested the MM connection establishment.

   NOTE 2: Further actions of the mobile station depend on the RR procedures and MM specific procedures during
           which the abnormal situation has occurred and are described together with those procedures.

   e) Access barred because of access class control or EAB

       The MM connection establishment shall not be initiated. The MS stays in the current serving cell and applies
       normal cell reselection process. The MM connection establishment may be initiated by CM layer if it is still
       necessary, i.e. when access is granted or because of a cell change.

   f) Indication that a CS fallback to GERAN or UTRAN has failed

       If EMM indicates that the CS fallback to GERAN or UTRAN failed, the MM sublayer shall abort the MM
       connection establishment and inform the requesting CM sublayer.

   g) "Extended wait time" for CS domain from the lower layers

       The MS shall abort the MM connection establishment and stop timer T3230 if still running.

       If the CM SERVICE REQUEST message contained the low priority indicator set to "MS is configured for NAS
       signalling low priority", the MS shall start timer T3246 with the "Extended wait time" value.

       In other cases the MS shall ignore the "Extended wait time".

       The MM connection establishment is started, if still necessary, when timer T3246 expires or is stopped.

   h) Timer T3246 is running

       The MM connection establishment shall not be initiated unless the MS is establishing an emergency call or the
       MS is an MS configured to use AC11 – 15 in selected PLMN. The MS stays in the current serving cell and
       applies normal cell reselection process. The MM connection establishment is started, if still necessary, when
       timer T3246 expires or is stopped.

Network side:

   a) RR connection failure

       The actions to be taken upon RR connection failure within a MM common procedure are described together with
       that procedure. A RR connection failure occurring outside such MM common procedures, shall trigger the
       release of all active MM connections if any.

   b) Invalid message or message content

       Upon reception of an invalid initial message or a CM SERVICE REQUEST message with invalid content, a CM
       SERVICE REJECT message shall be returned with one of the following appropriate Reject cause indications:

       # 95: Semantically incorrect message

       # 96: Mandatory information element error

       # 97: Message type non-existent or not implemented

       # 99: Information element non-existent or not implemented

       # 100: Conditional IE error

       # 111: Protocol error, unspecified

       When the CM SERVICE REJECT message has been sent, the network may start RR connection release if no
       other MM connections exist or if the abnormal condition also has influence on the other MM connections.

4.5.1.3          MM connection establishment initiated by the network

4.5.1.3.1            Mobile Terminating CM Activity
When a CM sublayer entity in the network requests the MM sublayer to establish a MM connection, the MM sublayer
will request the establishment of an RR connection to the RR sublayer if no RR connection to the desired mobile station
exists. The MM sublayer is informed when the paging procedure is finished (see 3GPP TS 44.018 [84] subclause 3.3.2
and 3GPP TS 25.331 [23c]) and the mobile station shall enter the MM state WAIT FOR NETWORK COMMAND and
stop the timer T3246 if running.

In A/Gb mode, when an RR connection is established (or if it already exists at the time the request is received), the MM
sublayer may initiate any of the MM common procedures (except IMSI detach); it may request the RR sublayer to
perform the RR classmark interrogation procedure, and/or the security mode setting procedure.

In Iu mode, when an RR connection is established (or if it already exists at the time the request is received), the MM
sublayer may initiate any of the MM common procedures (except IMSI detach); it may request the RR sublayer to
perform the security mode control procedure.

When all MM and RR procedures are successfully completed which the network considers necessary, the MM sublayer
will inform the requesting mobile terminating CM sublayer entity on the success of the MM connection establishment.

If an RR connection already exists and no MM specific procedure is running, the network may also establish a new
mobile terminating MM connection by sending a CM message with a new PD/TI combination.

If the MS receives the first CM message in the MM states WAIT FOR NETWORK COMMAND or RR
CONNECTION RELEASE NOT ALLOWED, the MS shall stop and reset the timers T3240 and T3241 and shall enter
the MM state MM CONNECTION ACTIVE.

In A/Gb mode, if the establishment of an RR connection is unsuccessful, or if any of the MM common procedures or
the security mode setting fail, this is indicated to the CM layer with an appropriate error cause.

In Iu mode, if the establishment of an RR connection is unsuccessful, or if any of the MM common procedures or the
security mode control fail, this is indicated to the CM layer with an appropriate error cause.

If an RR connection used for a MM specific procedure exists to the mobile station, the CM request may be rejected or
delayed depending on implementation. When the MM specific procedure has been completed, the network may use the
same RR connection for the delayed CM request.

Only applicable in case of VGCS talking:

In the MM CONNECTION ACTIVE (GROUP TRANSMIT MODE) the mobile station is in RR Group transmit mode.
There shall be only one MM connection active.

When in MM CONNECTION ACTIVE (GROUP TRANSMIT MODE) state, the MM sublayer in the network shall
reject the request for the establishment of another MM connection by any CM layer.

If the RR sublayer in the network indicates a request to perform a transfer of the mobile station from RR connected
mode to RR Group transmit mode which will result in a transition from MM CONNECTION ACTIVE state to MM
CONNECTION ACTIVE (GROUP TRANSMIT MODE) state in the MM sublayer, the MM sublayer shall not allow
the transition if more than one MM connection is active with the mobile station.

4.5.1.3.2            Mobile Originating CM Activity $(CCBS)$
When a CM sublayer entity in the network requests the MM sublayer to establish a MM connection, the MM sublayer
will request the establishment of an RR connection to the RR sublayer if no RR connection to the desired mobile station
exists. The MM sublayer is informed when the paging procedure is finished (see 3GPP TS 44.018 [84] subclause 3.3.2
and 3GPP TS 25.331 [23c]) and the mobile station shall enter the MM state WAIT FOR NETWORK COMMAND.

In A/Gb mode, when an RR connection is established (or if it already exists at the time the request is received), the MM
sublayer may initiate any of the MM common procedures (except IMSI detach), it may request the RR sublayer to
perform the RR classmark interrogation procedure and/or the security mode setting procedure.

In Iu mode, when an RR connection is established (or if it already exists at the time the request is received), the MM
sublayer may initiate any of the MM common procedures (except IMSI detach), it may request the RR sublayer to
perform the security mode control procedure.

The network should use the information contained in the Mobile Station Classmark Type 2 IE on the mobile station's
support for "Network Initiated MO CM Connection Request" to determine whether to:

       not start this procedure (eg if an RR connection already exists), or,

       to continue this procedure, or,

       to release the newly established RR connection.

In the case of a "Network Initiated MO CM Connection Request" the network shall use the established RR connection
to send a CM SERVICE PROMPT message to the mobile station.

If the mobile station supports "Network Initiated MO CM Connection Request", the MM sublayer of the MS gives an
indication to the CM entity identified by the CM SERVICE PROMPT message and enters the MM sublayer state
PROCESS CM SERVICE PROMPT. In the state PROCESS CM SERVICE PROMPT the MM sublayer waits for
either the rejection or confirmation of the recall by the identified CM entity. Any other requests from the CM entities
shall either be rejected or delayed until this state is left.

When the identified CM entity informs the MM sublayer, that it has send the first CM message in order to start the CM
recall procedure the MM sublayer enters the state MM CONNECTION ACTIVE.

If the identified CM entity indicates that it will not perform the CM recall procedure and all MM connections are
released by their CM entities the MS shall proceed according to subclause 4.5.3.1.

If the CM SERVICE PROMPT message is received by the MS in MM sublayer states WAIT FOR OUTGOING MM

A mobile that does not support "Network Initiated MO CM Connection Request" shall return an MM STATUS message
with cause #97 "message type non-existent or not implemented" to the network.

If the mobile station supports "Network Initiated MO CM Connection Request" but the identified CM entity in the
mobile station does not provide the associated support, then the mobile station shall send an MM STATUS message
with cause "Service option not supported". In the case of a temporary CM problem (eg lack of transaction identifiers)
then the mobile station shall send an MM STATUS message with cause "Service option temporarily out of order".

If an RR connection already exists and no MM specific procedure is running, the network may use it to send the CM
SERVICE PROMPT message.

In A/Gb mode, if the establishment of an RR connection is unsuccessful, or if any of the MM common procedures or
the security mode setting fail, this is indicated to the CM layer in the network with an appropriate error cause.

In Iu mode, if the establishment of an RR connection is unsuccessful, or if any of the MM common procedures or the
security mode control fail, this is indicated to the CM layer in the network with an appropriate error cause.

If an RR connection used for a MM specific procedure exists to the mobile station, the "Network Initiated MO CM
Connection Request" may be rejected or delayed depending on implementation. When the MM specific procedure has
been completed, the network may use the same RR connection for the delayed "Network Initiated MO CM Connection
Request".

4.5.1.3.3            Paging response in Iu mode (Iu mode only)
The network may initiate the paging procedure for CS services when the MS is IMSI attached for CS services. To
initiate the procedure, the MM entity requests the RR sublayer to initiate paging (see 3GPP TS 25.331 [23c],
3GPP TS 25.413 [19c] and 3GPP TS 44.118 [111]) for CS services.

At reception of a paging message, the RR sublayer in the MS shall deliver a paging indication to the MM sublayer if the
paging was initiated by the MM entity in the network (see 3GPP TS 25.331 [23c] and 3GPP TS 44.118 [111]) and the
MS shall stop the timer T3246, if running. The MS shall respond with the PAGING RESPONSE message defined in
3GPP TS 44.018 [84], subclause 9.1.25. For reasons of backward compatibility the paging response shall use the RR
protocol discriminator.

If the MS receives a paging request for CS services during an ongoing MM procedure, and the MS has already
requested the establishment of a radio connection, the MS shall ignore the paging request and the MS and the network
shall continue the MM procedure.

4.5.1.3.4            Paging response for CS fallback
The network may initiate the paging procedure for CS services when the MS is IMSI attached for CS services via EMM
combined procedures, as described in 3GPP TS 24.301 [120].

At reception of an indication of paging for CS services from EMM, the MS shall stop timer T3246, if it is running. The
MM sublayer in the MS requests EMM to perform the service request procedure for CS fallback.

After the MS changes to a GERAN or UTRAN cell, the MS shall:

   -   In A/Gb mode: ask for the establishment of an RR connection and proceed as if a paging has been received in the
       lower layers;

   -   In Iu mode: ask for the establishment of an RRC connection and respond with the PAGING RESPONSE
       message defined in 3GPP TS 44.018 [84], subclause 9.1.25. For reasons of backward compatibility the paging
       response shall use the RR protocol discriminator.

If the MS determines, before sending the response to paging, that it is in a different location area than the stored
location area, the MS shall initiate a normal location updating procedure first, regardless of Network Mode of
Operation. Additionally the MS performs routing area updating as specified in subclause 4.7.5. If the location area of
the current cell is not available, the MS may initiate a normal location updating procedure directly.




                                                          ETSI
3GPP TS 24.008 version 15.8.0 Release 15                   128                        ETSI TS 124 008 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


When initiating the location updating procedure, the MS shall indicate "CS fallback mobile terminating call" in the
Additional update parameters IE and the MS shall not include the MS network feature support IE. The MM connection
establishment is delayed until successful completion of the normal location updating procedure. After the completion of
the normal location updating procedure, the MS shall not send the PAGING RESPONSE message.

   NOTE:      For the race condition when the mobile station has a CM application request pending, the mobile station
              also indicates that it has a follow-on request pending.

4.5.1.4          Abnormal cases
The behaviour upon abnormal events is described together with the relevant RR procedure or MM common procedure.

In addition, the following abnormal events can be identified:

   a) Indication that a CS fallback to GERAN or UTRAN has failed

       If EMM indicates that the CS fallback to GERAN or UTRAN failed, the MM sublayer shall abort the paging
       response procedure.

   b) Paging message for an MS which is IMSI attached for GPRS and for non-GPRS services in order to obtain
      GPRS services and "SMS-only service"

       An MS that received the GPRS-SMS indicator set to "0" at the last combined GPRS attach or combined routing
       area updating procedure may ignore the paging for CS services.

       An MS that requested "SMS-only service" in the combined GPRS attach procedure or combined routing area
       updating procedure may ignore the paging for CS services.

   NOTE:      A network that is compliant with the earlier versions of the protocol will implicitly indicate to the MS that
              the delivery of SMS via GPRS is always supported, i.e. as GPRS-SMS indicator set to "0", even if it does
              not provide this support to the MS. The MS can learn whether SMS over GPRS is provided by using the
              mechanism defined in 3GPP TS 24.011 [22], subclause 2.6. If the MS learns that SMS over GPRS is
              provided, the MS can ignore paging for CS services.

4.5.1.5          MM connection establishment for emergency calls
A MM connection for an emergency call may be established in all states of the mobility management sublayer which
allow MM connection establishment for a normal originating call. In addition, establishment may be attempted in all
service states where a cell is selected (see subclause 4.2.2) but not in the MM CONNECTION ACTIVE state (GROUP
TRANSMIT MODE) state. However, as a network dependent option, a MM connection establishment for emergency
call may be rejected in some of the states.

When a user requests an emergency call establishment the mobile station will send a CM SERVICE REQUEST
message to the network with a CM service type information element indicating emergency call establishment. If the
network does not accept the emergency call request, e.g., because IMEI was used as identification and this capability is
not supported by the network, the network will reject the request by returning a CM SERVICE REJECT message to the
mobile station.

The reject cause information element indicates the reason for rejection. The following cause values may apply:

       #3 "Illegal MS"

       #4 "IMSI unknown in VLR"

       #5 "IMEI not accepted"

       #6 "   Illegal ME"

       #17    "Network failure"

       #22    "Congestion"

       #25    "Not authorized for this CSG"

       #32    "Service option not supported"



                                                          ETSI
3GPP TS 24.008 version 15.8.0 Release 15                   129                        ETSI TS 124 008 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


       #34    "Service option temporarily out of order"

With the above defined exceptions, the procedures described for MM connection establishment in subclauses 4.5.1.1
and 4.5.1.2 shall be followed.

   NOTE:      Normally, the mobile station will be identified by an IMSI or a TMSI. However, if none of these
              identifiers is available in the mobile station, then the mobile station shall use the IMEI for identification
              purposes. The network may in that case reject the request by returning a CM SERVICE REJECT message
              with reject cause: #5 "IMEI not accepted".

4.5.1.5a         MM connection establishment for emergency calls for CS fallback
When the MS is in NO CELL AVAILABLE state, camped on an E-UTRAN cell, and IMSI attached for CS services via
EMM combined procedures, as described in 3GPP TS 24.301 [120], the MM sublayer requests EMM to initiate a
service request procedure for mobile originating CS fallback emergency call, irrespective of whether timer T3246 is
running. The MM connection establishment is delayed until the mobile station changes to a GERAN or UTRAN cell.
After this point, the behaviour specified in subclause 4.5.1.5 applies.

When the MS is not IMSI attached for CS services via EMM combined procedures, as described in
3GPP TS 24.301 [120], and the MS is camping on an E-UTRAN cell, the MS shall perform any cell selection to
GERAN or UTRAN (see 3GPP TS 43.022 [82] and 3GPP TS 25.304 [98]). The MM connection establishment is
delayed until the MS changes to a GERAN or UTRAN cell. After this point, the behaviour specified in
subclause 4.5.1.5 applies.

4.5.1.6          Call re-establishment
The re-establishment procedure allows a MS to resume a connection in progress after a radio link failure, possibly in a
new cell and possibly in a new location area. The conditions in which to attempt call re-establishment or not depend on
the call control state, see subclause 5.5.4 and, whether or not a cell allowing call re-establishment has been found (as
described in 3GPP TS 45.008 [34]). MM connections are identified by their protocol discriminators and transaction
identifiers: these shall not be changed during call re-establishment.

The re-establishment takes place when a lower layer failure occurs and at least one MM connection is active (i.e. the
mobile station's MM sublayer is either in state 6 "MM CONNECTION ACTIVE" or state 20 "WAIT FOR
ADDITIONAL OUTGOING MM CONNECTION").

   NOTE:      During a re-establishment attempt the mobile station does not return to the MM IDLE state; thus no
              location updating is performed even if the mobile is not updated in the location area of the selected cell.

No call re-establishment shall be performed for voice group and broadcast calls.

4.5.1.6.1            Call re-establishment, initiation by the mobile station
   NOTE:      The network is unable to initiate call re-establishment.

If at least one request to re-establish an MM connection is received from a CM entity as a response to the indication that
the MM connection is interrupted (see subclause 4.5.2.3.) the mobile station initiates the call re-establishment
procedure. If several CM entities request re-establishment only one re-establishment procedure is initiated. If any CM
entity requests re-establishment, then re-establishment of all transactions belonging to all Protocol Discriminators that
permit Call Re-establishment shall be attempted.

Upon request of a CM entity to re-establish an MM connection the MM sublayer requests the RR sublayer to establish
an RR connection and enters MM sublayer state WAIT FOR REESTABLISH. This request contains an establishment
cause and a CM RE-ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message. When the establishment of an RR connection is
indicated by the RR sublayer, the MM sublayer of the mobile station starts timer T3230, gives an indication to all CM
entities that are being re-established, and remains in the MM sublayer state WAIT FOR REESTABLISH.

The CM RE-ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message contains the

   -   mobile identity according to subclause 10.5.1.4;

   -   mobile station classmark 2;




                                                          ETSI
3GPP TS 24.008 version 15.8.0 Release 15                   130                       ETSI TS 124 008 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


   -   ciphering key sequence number.

   NOTE:      Whether or not a CM entity can request re-establishment depends upon the Protocol Discriminator. The
              specifications for Short Message Service (3GPP TS 24.011 [22]), Call Independent Supplementary
              Services (3GPP TS 24.010 [21]) and Location Services (3GPP TS 44.071 [23a]) do not currently specify
              any re-establishment procedures.

For a shared GERAN in A/Gb mode, if the MS is a GERAN network sharing supporting MS, the chosen PLMN
identity shall be indicated to the GERAN in the CM RE-ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message using the Skip
Indicator IE as specified in subclause 10.3.1.

Upon receiving a CM RE-ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message, the network shall analyse its content. Depending
on the type of request, the network may start any of the MM common procedures and RR procedures.

The network may initiate the classmark interrogation procedure, for example, to obtain further information on the
mobile station's encryption capabilities.

The identification procedure (see subclause 4.3.3) may be invoked.

The network may invoke the authentication procedure (see subclause 4.3.2).

In A/Gb mode, the network decides if the security mode setting procedure shall be invoked (see 3GPP TS 44.018 [84]
subclause 3.4.7).

An indication from the RR sublayer that the security mode setting procedure is completed, or reception of a CM
SERVICE ACCEPT message, shall be treated as a service acceptance indication by the mobile station.

In Iu mode, the network decides if the security mode control procedure shall be invoked (see 3GPP TS 25.331 [23c] and
3GPP TS 44.118 [111]). An indication from the RR sublayer that the security mode control procedure is completed, or
reception of a CM SERVICE ACCEPT message, shall be treated as a service acceptance indication by the mobile
station.

The MM connection re-establishment is completed, timer T3230 shall be stopped, all CM entities associated with the
re-establishment shall be informed, and MM sublayer state MM CONNECTION ACTIVE is re-entered. All the MM
connections are considered to be active.

If the network cannot associate the re-establishment request with any existing call for that mobile station, a CM
SERVICE REJECT message is returned with the reject cause:

       #38    "call cannot be identified"

If call re-establishment cannot be performed for other reasons, a CM SERVICE REJECT is returned, the appropriate
reject cause may be any of the following (see annex G):

       #4     "IMSI unknown in VLR";

       #6     "illegal ME";

       #17    "network failure";

       #22    "congestion";

       #25    "not authorized for this CSG";

       #32    "service option not supported";

       #34    "service option temporarily out of order".

If the service request is rejected due to general NAS level mobility management congestion control, the network shall
set the MM cause value to #22 "congestion" and assign a back-off timer T3246 (see 3GPP TS 23.012 [140]).

Whatever the reject cause a mobile station receiving a CM SERVICE REJECT as a response to the CM RE-
ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST shall stop T3230, release all MM connections and proceed as described in
subclause 4.5.3.1. In addition:

   -   if cause value #4 is received, the mobile station deletes any TMSI, LAI and ciphering key sequence number in
       the SIM/USIM, changes the update status to NOT UPDATED (and stores it in the SIM/USIM according to

       subclause 4.1.2.2), and enters the MM sublayer state WAIT FOR NETWORK COMMAND. If subsequently the
       RR connection is released or aborted, this will force the mobile station to initiate a normal location updating. The
       CM re-establishment request shall not be memorized during the location updating procedure.

   -   if cause value #6 is received, the mobile station deletes any TMSI, LAI and ciphering key sequence number in
       the SIM/USIM, changes the update status to ROAMING NOT ALLOWED (and stores it in the SIM/USIM
       according to subclause 4.1.2.2), and enters the MM sublayer state WAIT FOR NETWORK COMMAND. The
       MS shall consider the SIM/USIM as invalid for non-GPRS services until switch-off or the SIM/USIM is
       removed.

   -   If cause value # 22 is received, the T3246 value IE is present in the CM SERVICE REJECT message and the
       value indicates that this timer is neither zero nor deactivated, the MS shall abort the re-establishment, release any
       MM connections, and proceed as specified in subclause 4.5.3.1. The MS shall stop timer T3246 if it is running.
       If the CM SERVICE REJECT message is integrity protected, the MS shall start timer T3246 with the value
       provided in the T3246 value IE. If the CM SERVICE REJECT message is not integrity protected, the MS shall
       start timer T3246 with a random value from the default range specified in table 11.1. The MS stays in the current
       serving cell and applies the normal cell reselection process. The CM RE-ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST
       procedure should not be restarted when timer T3246 expires or is stopped.

       If cause value #22 is received, the T3246 value IE is not present in the CM SERVICE REJECT message or if the
       value provided in the T3246 value IE indicates that this timer is zero or deactivated, the MS shall abort the re-
       establishment, release any MM connections, and proceed as specified in subclause 4.5.3.1.

   -   if cause value #25 is received from a CSG cell and the mobile station is in UTRAN Iu mode, the MS shall check
       whether the CM SERVICE REJECT message with cause #25 is integrity protected. If the message is not
       integrity protected, the MS shall discard the message. Otherwise, the MS shall remove the entry corresponding to
       the CSG ID and associated PLMN identity of the cell where the MS has sent the CM SERVICE REQUEST
       message from the Allowed CSG list if the CSG ID and associated PLMN identity are contained in the Allowed
       CSG list, and enter the MM sublayer state WAIT FOR NETWORK COMMAND. If the CSG ID and associated
       PLMN identity of the cell where the MS has sent the CM SERVICE REQUEST message is contained in the
       Operator CSG list, the MS shall proceed as specified in 3GPP TS 23.122 [14] subclause 3.1A.

       If cause value #25 is received and the cell is not a CSG cell or the MS is not in UTRAN Iu mode, the MS shall
       discard the CM SERVICE REJECT message.

4.5.1.6.2              Abnormal cases
Mobile station side:

   a) Random access failure or RR connection establishment failure

       If the mobile station detects a random access failure or RR connection establishment failure during the re-
       establishment of an MM connection, the re-establishment is aborted and all MM connections are released.

   b) RR connection failure

       If a RR connection failure occurs, timer T3230 is stopped, the re-establishment is aborted and all active MM
       connections are released.

   c) IMSI deactivation

       If the IMSI deactivated during the re-establishment attempt then timer T3230 is stopped, the re-establishment is
       aborted and all MM connections are released.

   d) T3230 expires

       If T3230 expires (i.e. no response is given but a RR connection is available) the re-establishment is aborted, all
       active MM connections are released and the mobile station proceeds as described in subclause 4.5.3.1.

   e) Reject causes #96, #97, #99, #100, #111 received

       The mobile station shall perform the same actions as if timer T3230 had expired.

Network side:

   a) RR connection failure

       If a RR connection failure occurs after receipt of the CM RE-ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST the network shall
       release all MM connections.

   b) Invalid message content

       Upon reception an invalid initial of message or a CM RE-ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message with invalid
       content, a CM SERVICE REJECT message shall be returned with one of the following appropriate Reject cause
       indications:

       #96:   Mandatory information element error

       #99:   Information element non-existent or not implemented

       #100: Conditional IE error

       #111: Protocol error, unspecified

When the CM SERVICE REJECT message has been sent, the network shall release the RR connection.

4.5.1.7          Forced release during MO MM connection establishment
If the mobile station's CM layer initiated the MM connection establishment but the CM layer wishes to abort the
establishment prior to the completion of the establishment phase, the mobile station shall send a CM SERVICE
ABORT message any time after the completion of the RR connection and not after the first CM message (e.g. SETUP)
is sent.

If the first CM message has already been sent, the normal release procedure defined by the appropriate CM protocol
applies and the CM SERVICE ABORT shall not be sent.

Sending of the CM SERVICE ABORT message is only allowed during the establishment of the first MM connection,
where no other MM connection exists in parallel. If parallel MM connections exist already, a new connection
establishment cannot be aborted and normal MM connection release according to subclause 4.5.3 applies after MM
connection establishment.

Upon transmission of the CM SERVICE ABORT message the mobile station shall stop timer T3230 and shall follow
the procedures specified in subclause 4.5.3.1.

Upon receipt of the CM SERVICE ABORT message the network shall abort ongoing processes, release the appropriate
resources, and unless another MM connection establishment is pending or an RRLP procedure (see
3GPP TS 44.031 [23b]) or LCS procedure over RRC (see 3GPP TS 25.331 [23c]) is ongoing, initiate a normal release
of the RR connection.

4.5.1.8          MM connection establishment due to SRVCC or vSRVCC handover
An MM connection can be established locally in the MS due to an SRVCC or vSRVCC handover (see
3GPP TS 23.216 [126]), i.e. without dedicated MM signalling. That is the case when the MS has:

   -   a voice media stream carried over the PS domain that is handed over to the CS domain in A/Gb mode or Iu mode
       via SRVCC;

   -   a voice media stream and a video media stream of a single session carried over the PS domain in S1 mode that is
       handed over to the CS domain in Iu mode via vSRVCC; or

   -   a voice media stream and a video media stream of a single session carried over the PS domain in S1 mode but
       only the voice media stream is handed over to the CS domain in A/Gb mode via SRVCC.

An MS in MM state MM IDLE shall establish the MM connection locally when it receives an indication from lower
layers that either a voice only SRVCC handover or a voice and video SRVCC handover was completed successfully.

After completing MM connection establishment, the MM layer shall indicate "MM connection establishment due to
SRVCC handover" or "MM connection establishment due to vSRVCC handover" to the upper layer and shall enter state
MM CONNECTION ACTIVE.

4.5.1.9           MM connection establishment due to Dual Radio Voice Call Continuity
                  (DRVCC) access transfer
The MM Connection establishment procedures for a dual radio voice call continuity (DRVCC) access transfer follow
the procedures described in subclause 4.5.1.1 with the following additions:

Upon request from the upper layers to set up a DRVCC call, the MS shall initiate the MM connection establishment and
send a CM SERVICE REQUEST message. The MS shall include the Additional update parameters information element
indicating "DRVCC call". If the MS determines that it is in a different location area than the stored location area, the
MS shall first initiate a normal location updating procedure regardless of Network Mode of Operation. The MS shall
indicate "follow-on request pending", shall include the Additional update parameters information element indicating
"DRVCC call", and shall not include the MS network feature support information element in the LOCATION
UPDATING REQUEST message.

The network may use the "DRVCC call" indication to decide whether to initiate any of the MM common procedures.

If the MS and the network have an established GSM security context or UMTS security context, the MS and the
network may take the key(s) of the established security context into use as specified in subclause 4.3.2.7a.


4.5.2         MM connection information transfer phase
After the MM connection has been established, it can be used by the CM sublayer entity for information transfer.
According to the protocol architecture described in 3GPP TS 24.007 [20], each CM entity will have its own MM
connection. These different MM connections are identified by the protocol discriminator PD and, additionally, by the
transaction identifier TI.

All MM common procedures may be initiated at any time while MM connections are active. Except for Short Message
Control which uses a separate layer 2 low priority data link, no priority mechanism is defined between the CM, MM
and RR sublayer messages.

4.5.2.1           Sending CM messages
A CM sublayer entity, after having been advised that a MM connection has been established, can request the transfer of
CM messages. The CM messages passed to the MM sublayer are then sent to the other side of the interface with the PD
and TI set according to the source entity.

4.5.2.2           Receiving CM messages
Upon receiving a CM message, the MM sublayer will distribute it to the relevant CM entity according to the PD value
and TI value. However, if the received CM message is the first for the MM connection (identified by PD and TI), the
MM sublayer will in addition indicate to the CM entity that a new MM connection has been established.

4.5.2.3           Abnormal cases
RR connection failure:

       If the RR connection failure occurs during a RR or MM common procedure, the consequent actions are
       described together with that procedure.

In other cases, the following applies:

   -   Mobile station:

           The MM sublayer shall indicate to all CM entities associated with active MM connections that the MM
           connection is interrupted, the subsequent action of the MM sublayer (call re-establishment, see 4.5.1.6, or
           local release) will then depend on the decisions by the CM entities.

   -   Network:

           The MM sublayer shall locally release all active MM connections. As an option the network may delay the
           release of all or some of the MM connections to allow the mobile station to initiate call re-establishment.

4.5.3         MM connection release
An established MM connection can be released by the local CM entity. The release of the CM connection will then be
done locally in the MM sublayer, i.e. no MM message are sent over the radio interface for this purpose.

4.5.3.1          Release of associated RR connection
If all MM connections are released by their CM entities, and no RRLP procedure (see 3GPP TS 44.031 [23b]) and no
LCS procedure over RRC (see 3GPP TS 25.331 [23c]) is ongoing, the mobile station shall set timer T3240 and enter the
state WAIT FOR NETWORK COMMAND, expecting the release of the RR connection.

If all MM connections are released by their CM entities and an RRLP procedure or LCS procedure over RRC is
ongoing, the MS shall start the timer T3241 and enter the state RR CONNECTION RELEASE NOT ALLOWED.

If the MS is expecting the release of the RR connection in MM state WAIT FOR NETWORK COMMAND and an
RRLP procedure or LCS procedure over RRC is started, the MS shall stop the timer T3240, start the timer T3241 and
enter the state RR CONNECTION RELEASE NOT ALLOWED.

If the MS is in MM state RR CONNECTION RELEASE NOT ALLOWED and the ongoing RRLP procedure or LCS
procedure over RRC is finished, the MS shall stop the timer T3241, reset and start the timer T3240 and shall enter the
state WAIT FOR NETWORK COMMAND.

If the MS receives the "Extended wait time" for CS domain from the lower layers when no location updating or CM
service request procedure is ongoing, the MS shall ignore the "Extended wait time".

In the network, if the last MM connection is released by its user, the MM sublayer may decide to release the RR
connection. The RR connection may be maintained by the network, e.g. in order to establish another MM connection.

If the RR connection is not released within a given time controlled by the timer T3240 or T3241, the mobile station
shall abort the RR connection. In both cases, either after a RR connection release triggered from the network side or
after a RR connection abort requested by the MS-side, the MS shall return to MM IDLE state; the service state
depending upon the current update status as specified in subclause 4.2.3.

4.5.3.2          Uplink release in a voice group call
(Only applicable for mobile stations supporting VGCS talking:)

If a mobile station which is in the MM sublayer state MM CONNECTION ACTIVE (GROUP TRANSMIT MODE)
receives a request from the GCC sublayer to perform an uplink release, the MM sublayer requests the RR sublayer to
perform an uplink release procedure and enters the MM sublayer state RECEIVING GROUP CALL (NORMAL
SERVICE).


4.6           Receiving a MM STATUS message by a MM entity.
If the MM entity of the mobile station receives a MM STATUS message no state transition and no specific action shall
be taken as seen from the radio interface, i.e. local actions are possible.

With the exceptions described for the responses to the CM SERVICE PROMPT message, the actions to be taken on
receiving a MM STATUS message in the network are an implementation dependent option.


4.7           Elementary mobility management procedures for GPRS
              services
4.7.1         General
This subclause describes the basic functions offered by the mobility management (GMM) sublayer at the radio interface
(reference point Um/UU). The functionality is described in terms of timers and procedures. During GMM procedures,
procedures of CM layer services via the PS domain, e.g. SM, SMS, and SS, are suspended.

4.7.1.1           Lower layer failure
The lower layers shall indicate a logical link failure or an RR sublayer failure or an RRC sublayer failure to the GMM
sublayer. The failure indicates an error that cannot be corrected by the lower layers.

4.7.1.2           Ciphering of messages (A/Gb mode only)
If ciphering is to be applied on a GMM context, all GMM messages shall be ciphered except the following messages:

   -- ATTACH REQUEST;

   -- ATTACH REJECT;

   -- AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING REQUEST;

   -- AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING RESPONSE;

   -- AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING FAILURE;

   -- AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING REJECT;

   -- IDENTITY REQUEST;

   -- IDENTITY RESPONSE;

   -- ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST; and

   -- ROUTING AREA UPDATE REJECT.

4.7.1.2a         Integrity protection of layer 3 signalling messages (A/Gb mode only and
                 when integrity protection is required)

4.7.1.2a.1           General
The requirements in subclause 4.7.1.2a are only applicable for MSs and networks supporting EC-GSM-IoT (see
3GPP TS 43.064 [159]).

For the MS, integrity protected signalling is mandatory for the GMM messages and SM messagres once a valid UMTS
security context exists and has been taken into use. For the network, integrity protected signalling is mandatory for the
GMM messages and SM messages once authentication and ciphering procedure is initiated by the network. Integrity
protection of all GMM signalling messages and SM messages is the responsibility of the LLC layer. In addition, the
GMM layer protects the AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING REQUEST message and the AUTHENTICATION
AND CIPHERING RESPONSE message by a message authentication code (MAC) calculated at the GMM layer when
an authentication takes place in the Authentication and Ciphering procedure. This message authentication code is
included in the AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING REQUEST message and the AUTHENTICATION AND
CIPHERING RESPONSE message. The GMM layer is always using the new UMTS security context derived from the
AKA taking place in the Authentication and Ciphering procedure when calculating the message authentication code
(MAC) at GMM layer.

The GMM layer activates integrity protection in the LLC layer by providing an indication when integrity protection
shall be started.

Integrity protection is initiated in the MS upon request from the network. This is done using the authentication and
ciphering procedure at the GMM layer (3GPP TS 43.020 [13] and 3GPP TS 44.064 [78a]).

Details of the integrity protection and verification of GMM signalling messages are specified in 3GPP TS 43.020 [13].

4.7.1.2a.2           Integrity checking of GMM signalling messages in the MS
Except the messages listed below, no GMM signalling messages shall be processed by the receiving GMM entity in the
MS or forwarded to the SM entity, unless the use of integrity protection has been successfully negotiated:

   -   GMM messages:




                                                          ETSI

       -   IDENTITY REQUEST (only if the requested identification parameter is IMSI)

       -   ATTACH REJECT (if the cause is not #25)

       -   AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING REJECT

       -   ROUTING AREA UPDATE REJECT (if the cause is not #25)

       -   DETACH ACCEPT (for non power-off)

   NOTE:      These messages are accepted by the MS without integrity protection, as in certain situations they are sent
              by the network before integrity protection can be activated.

All SM messages shall be integrity protected.

Once the integrity protection has been successfully negotiated, the receiving GMM or SM entity in the MS shall not
process any GMM signalling messages unless they have been successfully integrity checked by the LLC layer. If GMM
signalling messages, having not successfully passed the integrity check, are received, then the LLC layer in the MS
discards that message. The processing of the AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING REQUEST message, at
authentication, that has not successfully passed the integrity check at GMM layer is specified in subclause 4.7.7.2. If
any GMM or SM signalling message is received without integrity protection even though integrity protection has been
successfully negotiated, then the GMM layer shall discard this message.

4.7.1.2a.3           Integrity checking of layer 3 signalling messages in the network
Except the messages listed below, no GMM signalling messages shall be processed by the receiving GMM entity in the
network or forwarded to the SM entity, unless integrity protection has been successfully negotiated:

   -   GMM messages:

       -   ATTACH REQUEST;

       -   IDENTITY RESPONSE (if requested identification parameter is IMSI);

       -   AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING FAILURE;

       -   DETACH REQUEST;

       -   DETACH ACCEPT.

All SM messages are integrity protected.

Once a valid UMTS security context exists, until integrity protection has been successfully negotiated, the receiving
GMM entity in the network shall process the following GMM signalling messages, even if the MAC included in the
LLC frame carrying the GMM message fails the integrity check or cannot be verified in the LLC layer, as the UMTS
security context is not available in the network:

       -   ATTACH REQUEST;

       -   IDENTITY RESPONSE (if requested identification parameter is IMSI);

       -   AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING FAILURE;

       -   DETACH REQUEST (if sent before integrity protection has been activated);

       -   DETACH ACCEPT;

       -   ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST;

   NOTE:      These messages are processed by the GMM layer even when the MAC fails the integrity check or cannot
              be verified, as in certain situations they can be sent by the MS protected with an UMTS security context
              that is no longer available in the network.

If an ATTACH REQUEST message fails the integrity check, the network shall authenticate the subscriber before
processing the attach request any further.

If a ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message fails the integrity check, the network shall initiate an re-
authentication of the subscriber by initiating an authentication and ciphering procedure.

Once integrity protection has been successfully negotiated, the receiving GMM or SM entity in the network shall not
process any GMM or SM signalling messages unless they have been successfully integrity checked by the LLC layer. If
any GMM or SM signalling message, having not successfully passed the integrity check, is received, then the LLC layer
in the network discards that message. The processing of the AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING RESPONSE
message when authentication is taking place, that has not successfully passed the integrity check at GMM layer is
specified in subclause 4.7.7.3. If any GMM or SM signalling message is received, as not integrity protected even though
integrity protection has been successfully negotiated, then the GMM layer shall discard this message.

4.7.1.2a.4           Establishment of integrity protection of layer 3 signalling messages
Establishment of integrity protection of layer 3 signalling messages and optionally user plane data is done during the
attach procedure. The MS shall indicate support for integrity protection in the MS network capability IE included in the
ATTACH REQUEST message and the ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message to the network.

When an MS sends an ATTACH REQUEST message or a ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, then if
the MS has no UMTS security context, it shall send the ATTACH REQUEST or the ROUTING AREA UPDATE
REQUEST message without integrity protection to the network. If the network supports integrity protection, then the
network activates integrity protection by initiating an authentication and ciphering procedure. The network selects an
integrity algorithm among the supported integrity algorithms indicated by the MS in the MS network capability IE.
After successful completion of the authentication and ciphering procedure, all layer 3 signalling messages sent between
the MS and network are integrity protected in the LLC layer using the new UMTS security context.

When an MS sends an ATTACH REQUEST message or a ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, then if
the MS has a UMTS security context, it shall send the ATTACH REQUEST or the ROUTING AREA UPDATE
REQUEST message integrity protected with the current UMTS security context to the network. The MS shall include
the CKSN indicating the current UMTS security context value in the initial ATTACH REQUEST message or a
ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message. The MS shall use the integrity algorithm identified by the stored
integrity algorithm identifier. The network shall check whether the CKSN included in the initial ATTACH REQUEST
message or the ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message belongs to an UMTS security context available in the
network, and if yes, then the network re-establishes integrity protection of layer 3 signalling messages in the LLC layer:

   -   by replying with a GMM message (ATTACH ACCEPT or ROUTING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT) that is
       integrity protected in LLC layer by using the current UMTS security context. From this time onward, all layer 3
       signalling messages exchanged between the MS and the network are sent integrity protected, except for the
       messages specified in subclause 4.7.1.2a; or

   -   by initiating an authentication and ciphering procedure. This procedure can be used by the network to select a
       new integrity algorithm different from the one currently used by the MS.

   NOTE:      Even if the message authentication code protecting the ATTACH REQUEST or the ROUTING AREA
              UPDATE message in the LLC layer cannot be verified in the network due to the integrity key and the
              integrity algorithm in the LLC layer at the network not having been configured yet for this MS, the
              network progresses the attach procedure and the routing atra updating procedure at the GMM layer
              anyway without having to run a new authentication and ciphering procedure if the network decides to re-
              use the same encryption- and integrity keys and the same ciphering and integrity algorithms and not run a
              re-authentication.

4.7.1.2a.5           Optional establishment of integrity protection in the user plane
If an MS supports integrity protection of user plane data, then the MS shall indicate in the MS network capability IE to
the network that it supports integrity protection of user plane data when it sends an ATTACH REQUEST message or a
ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message. If the network supports integrity protection of the user plane data,
then the network shall indicate in the ATTACH ACCEPT message or the ROUTING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT
message to the MS that integrity protection of user plane data shall be used.

4.7.1.2a.6           Change of security keys
When the network initiates a re-authentication to create a new UMTS security context, the AUTHENTICATION AND
CIPHERING REQUEST message and AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING RESPONSE message exchanged

during the authentication and ciphering procedure are integrity protected with the new UMTS security context at GMM
layer by including a MAC. The AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING REQUEST message and
AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING RESPONSE message may be also integrity protected at the LLC layer using
the current UMTS security context, if any. Both UE and network shall continue to use the current UMTS security
context, until the network initiates a re-authentication in the authentication and ciphering procedure. The
AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING REQUEST message sent by the network includes the CKSN of the new
UMTS security context to be used. The SGSN shall send the AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING REQUEST
message integrity protected with the new UMTS security context at GMM layer by including a MAC, but unciphered.
When the UE responds with an AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING RESPONSE message, it shall send the
message integrity protected with the new UMTS security context at GMM layer by including a MAC, but unciphered.

The UE shall take the new UMTS security context and the indicated integrity algorithm and encryption algorithm
received in the AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING REQUEST message, into use in the LLC layer after sending
the AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING RESPONSE message. The network shall take the new UMTS security
context and the indicated integrity algorithm and encryption algorithm sent in the AUTHENTICATION AND
CIPHERING REQUEST message, into use in the LLC layer in the network after receiving the AUTHENTICATION
AND CIPHERING RESPONSE message and a successful check of the RES.

4.7.1.3          P-TMSI signature
The network may assign a P-TMSI signature to an MS in an attach, routing area update, or P-TMSI reallocation
procedure. Only in combination with a valid P-TMSI, this P-TMSI signature is used by the MS for authentication and
identification purposes in the subsequent attach, routing area update or detach procedure. If the MS has no valid P-
TMSI it shall not use the P-TMSI signature in the subsequent attach, routing area update or detach procedure. Upon
successful completion of the subsequent attach or routing area update procedure, the used P-TMSI signature shall be
deleted. Upon completion of an MS initiated detach procedure, the used P-TMSI signature shall be deleted. Upon
completion of a network initiated detach procedure the P-TMSI signature shall be kept, unless explicitly specified
otherwise in subclause 4.7.4.2.2.

4.7.1.4          Radio resource sublayer address handling
In A/Gb mode, while a packet TMSI (P-TMSI) is used in the GMM sublayer for identification of an MS, a temporary
logical link identity (TLLI) is used for addressing purposes at the RR sublayer.

In Iu mode a Radio Network Temporary Identity (RNTI) identifies a user between the MS and the UTRAN or GERAN.
The relationship between RNTI and IMSI is known only in the MS and in the UTRAN, see 3GPP TS 25.301 [128].

4.7.1.4.1            Radio resource sublayer address handling (A/Gb mode only)
This subclause describes how the RR addressing is managed by GMM. For the detailed coding of the different TLLI
types and how a TLLI can be derived from a P-TMSI, see 3GPP TS 23.003 [10].

If the MS is configured for "AttachWithIMSI" as specified in 3GPP TS 24.368 [135] or 3GPP TS 31.102 [112] and is
entering a new PLMN which is neither the registered PLMN nor in the list of equivalent PLMNs, the MS should
proceed as specified for case ii) below and use a randomly selected random TLLI for the transmission of the ATTACH
REQUEST message.

For all other cases, the MS shall determine the TLLI as follows:

For an MS not supporting S1 mode, two cases can be distinguished:

   -   a valid P-TMSI is available in the MS; or

   -   no valid P-TMSI is available in the MS.

   i) valid P-TMSI available

       If the MS has stored a valid P-TMSI, the MS shall derive a foreign TLLI from that P-TMSI and shall use it for
       transmission of the:

       -   ATTACH REQUEST message of any GPRS combined/non-combined attach procedure; other GMM
           messages sent during this procedure shall be transmitted using the same foreign TLLI until the ATTACH
           ACCEPT message or the ATTACH REJECT message is received; and

3GPP TS 24.008 version 15.8.0 Release 15                    139                    ETSI TS 124 008 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


       -   ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message of a combined/non-combined RAU procedure if the MS
           has entered a new routing area, or if the GPRS update status is not equal to GU1 UPDATED. Other GMM
           messages sent during this procedure shall be transmitted using the same foreign TLLI, until the ROUTING
           AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message or the ROUTING AREA UPDATE REJECT message is received.

       After a successful GPRS attach or routing area update procedure, independent of whether a new P-TMSI is
       assigned, if the MS has stored a valid P-TMSI then the MS shall derive a local TLLI from the stored P-TMSI
       and shall use it for addressing at lower layers.

   NOTE 1: Although the MS derives a local TLLI for addressing at lower layers, the network should not assume that
           it will receive only LLC frames using a local TLLI. Immediately after the successful GPRS attach or
           routing area update procedure, the network must be prepared to continue accepting LLC frames from the
           MS still using the foreign TLLI.

   ii) no valid P-TMSI available

       When the MS has not stored a valid P-TMSI, i.e. the MS is not attached to GPRS, the MS shall use a randomly
       selected random TLLI for transmission of the:

       -   ATTACH REQUEST message of any combined/non-combined GPRS attach procedure.

       The same randomly selected random TLLI value shall be used for all message retransmission attempts and for
       the cell updates within one attach attempt.

       Upon receipt of an ATTACH REQUEST message, the network shall assign a P-TMSI to the MS. The network
       derives a local TLLI from the assigned P-TMSI, and transmits the assigned P-TMSI to the MS.

       Upon receipt of the assigned P-TMSI, the MS shall derive the local TLLI from this P-TMSI and shall use it for
       addressing at lower layers.

   NOTE 2: Although the MS derives a local TLLI for addressing at lower layers, the network should not assume that
           it will receive only LLC frames using a local TLLI. Immediately after the successful GPRS attach, the
           network must be prepared to continue accepting LLC frames from the MS still using the random TLLI.

In both cases the MS shall acknowledge the reception of the assigned P-TMSI to the network. After receipt of the
acknowledgement, the network shall use the local TLLI for addressing at lower layers.

For an MS supporting S1 mode, the following five cases can be distinguished:

   a) the TIN indicates "P-TMSI" or "RAT-related TMSI" and the MS holds a valid P-TMSI and a RAI;

   b) the TIN indicates "GUTI" and the MS holds a valid GUTI;

   c) the TIN is deleted and the MS holds a valid P-TMSI and RAI;

   d) the TIN is deleted and the MS holds a valid GUTI, but no valid P-TMSI and RAI; or

   e) none of the previous cases is fulfilled.

In case a) the MS shall derive a foreign TLLI from the P-TMSI and proceed as specified for case i) above.

In case b), the MS shall derive a P-TMSI from the GUTI and then a foreign TLLI from this P-TMSI and proceed as
specified for case i) above.

   NOTE 3: The mapping of the GUTI to the P-TMSI is specified in 3GPP TS 23.003 [10].

In case c) the MS shall derive a foreign TLLI from the P-TMSI and proceed as specified for case i) above.

In case d) the MS shall derive a P-TMSI from the GUTI and then a foreign TLLI from this P-TMSI and proceed as
specified for case i) above.

In case e) the MS shall proceed as as specified for case ii) above.

For transmission of an ATTACH REQUEST message, or a ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message after a
routing area change, the MS also provides the lower layers with the DCN-ID according to the following rules:

   a) if a DCN-ID for the PLMN code of the selected PLMN is available in the MS, the MS shall provide this DCN-
      ID to the lower layers; or

   b) if no DCN-ID for the PLMN code of the selected PLMN is available but a Default_DCN_ID value is available in
      the MS, as specified in 3GPP TS 24.368 [135] or in USIM file NASCONFIG as specified in 3GPP TS 31.102 [112],
      the MS shall provide the Default_DCN_ID value to the lower layers.

4.7.1.5          P-TMSI handling

4.7.1.5.1            P-TMSI handling in A/Gb mode
If a new P-TMSI is assigned by the network the MS and the network shall handle the old and the new P-TMSI as
follows:

Upon receipt of a GMM message containing a new P-TMSI the MS shall consider the new P-TMSI and new RAI and
also the old P-TMSI and old RAI as valid in order to react to paging requests and downlink transmission of LLC
frames. For uplink transmission of LLC frames the new P-TMSI shall be used.

   NOTE:      For the case of multiple consecutive P-TMSI REALLOCATION COMMAND messages, the old P-TMSI
              is the latest P-TMSI included by the network in a previous message different from the multiple
              consecutive P-TMSI REALLOCATION COMMAND messages.

The MS shall consider the old P-TMSI and old RAI as invalid as soon as an LLC frame is received with the local TLLI
derived from the new P-TMSI.

Upon the transmission of a GMM message containing a new P-TMSI the network shall consider the new P-TMSI and
new RAI and also the old P-TMSI and old RAI as valid in order to be able to receive LLC frames from the MS.

The network shall consider the old P-TMSI and old RAI as invalid as soon as an LLC frame is received with the local
TLLI derived from the new P-TMSI.

4.7.1.5.2            P-TMSI handling in Iu mode
If a new P-TMSI is assigned by the network the MS and the network shall handle the old and the new P-TMSI as
follows:

Upon receipt of a GMM message containing a new P-TMSI the MS shall consider the new P-TMSI and new RAI as
valid. Old P-TMSI and old RAI are regarded as invalid.

The network shall consider the old P-TMSI and old RAI as invalid as soon as an acknowledge message (e.g. ATTACH
COMPLETE, ROUTING AREA UPDATE COMPLETE and P-TMSI REALLOCATION COMPLETE) is received.

4.7.1.6          Change of network mode of operation
In the following tables below the abbreviations 'A/Gb mode I' and 'A/Gb mode II' are used for network operation mode
I and II in A/Gb mode.

4.7.1.7          Intersystem change between A/Gb mode and Iu mode
For the Iu mode to A/Gb mode and A/Gb mode to Iu mode intersystem change the following cases can be
distinguished:

   a) Intersystem change between cells belonging to different RA's:

      The procedures executed by the MS depends on the network mode of operation in the old and new RA. If a
      change of the network operation mode has occurred in the new RA, then the MS shall behave as specified in
      subclause 4.7.1.6. If no change of the network operation mode has occurred in the new RA, then the MS shall
      initiate the normal or combined routing area updating procedure depending on the network operation mode in the
      current RA.

   b) Intersystem change between cells belonging to the same RA:

      1) If the READY timer is running in the MS in A/Gb mode before or after the inter-system change occurs,or the
         MS is in PMM-CONNECTED mode in Iu mode, before the inter-system change occurs then the MS shall
         perform a normal or combined routing area updating procedure depending on the network mode of operation
         in the current RA.

      2) If the READY timer is not running in the MS in A/Gb mode before the inter-system change occurs, or the
         MS is in PMM-IDLE mode in Iu mode before the inter-system change and the READY timer is not running
         in the MS in A/Gb mode after the intersystem change, then, unless a routing area updating procedure is
         required according to case c) or case b) 3) below or according to subclause 4.7.5.1 and 4.7.5.2.1, the MS shall
         not perform a routing area updating procedure until uplink user data or signalling information needs to be
         sent from the MS to the network.

          -   If the MS is in the same access network(i.e. A/Gb mode or Iu mode), as when it last sent user data or
              signalling messages, the procedures defined for that access system shall be followed. This shall be
              sending of an LLC PDU in an A/Gb mode cell or initiating the service request procedure in an Iu mode
              cell.

          -   If the MS is in a different access network (i.e. A/Gb mode or Iu mode), as when it last sent user data or
              signalling messages, the normal or combined routing area updating procedure shall be performed
              depending on the network operation mode in the current RA, before the sending of user data or signalling
              messages. If the signalling message is a DETACH REQUEST indicating "power off", the routing area
              updating procedure need not to be performed.

          -   If the periodic routing area update timer expires the MS shall initiate the periodic routing area updating
              procedure.

      3) If the READY timer is not running in the MS in A/Gb mode or the MS is in PMM-IDLE mode in Iu mode,
         then the MS shall perform a normal or combined routing area updating procedure depending on the network
         mode of operation in the current RA if the MS is required to perform routing area updating for IMS voice
         termination as specified in annex P.3.

      4) If the READY timer is not running in the network in A/Gb mode or the network is in PMM-IDLE mode in Iu
         mode, then the network shall page the MS if downlink user data or signalling information needs to be sent
         from the network to the MS. This shall include both A/Gb mode and Iu mode cells.

          -   If the MS receives the paging indication in the same access network (i.e. A/Gb mode or Iu mode), as
              when it last sent user data or signalling information, the MS shall send any LLC PDU in a A/Gb mode
              cell or shall initiate the service request procedure indicating service type "paging response" in an Iu mode
              cell.

          -   If the MS receives the paging indication in a different access network (i.e. A/Gb mode or Iu mode), as
              when it last sent user data or signalling information, the MS shall perform a normal or combined routing
              area updating procedure depending on the network operation mode in the current RA.

   c) Intersystem handover from A/Gb mode to Iu mode during a CS connection:

      After the successful completion of the handover from an A/Gb mode cell to an Iu mode cell, an MS which has
      performed the GPRS suspension procedure in Gb mode (see 3GPP TS 44.018 [84]) (i.e. an MS in MS operation
      mode B or an DTM MS in a A/Gb mode cell that does not support DTM) shall perform a normal routing area

       updating procedure in the Iu mode cell in order to resume the GPRS services in the network, before sending any
       other signalling messages or user data.

4.7.1.7a         Intersystem change from S1 mode to A/Gb mode or S1 mode to Iu mode with
                 ISR activated
If ISR is activated and the MS returns from S1 mode to a cell belonging to a RA which is different from the RA where
the MS is registered, the MS initiates a normal or combined routing area updating procedure depending on the network
operation mode in the current RA.

If ISR is activated and the MS returns from S1 mode to a cell belonging to the RA where the MS is registered, the
following cases can be distinguished:

   a) Inter-system change due to PS handover:

       If the PS handover is to A/Gb mode, the MS initiates a normal or combined routing area updating procedure
       depending on the network operation mode in the current RA.

   b) Inter-system change not due to PS handover:

       1) If the READY timer is running in the MS after the inters-ystem change occurs, then the MS shall perform a
          normal or combined routing area updating procedure depending on the network mode of operation in the
          current RA.

       2) If the READY timer is not running in the MS in A/Gb mode or the MS is in PMM-IDLE mode in Iu mode
          after the intersystem change occurs, unless a routing area updating procedure is required according to
          subclause 4.7.5.1 and 4.7.5.2.1, the MS shall not perform a routing area updating procedure until uplink user
          data or signalling information needs to be sent from the MS to the network.

          -   If the MS is in the same access network, (i.e. A/Gb mode or Iu mode), as when it last sent user data or
              signalling messages in a cell belonging to the RA where the MS is registered, the procedures defined for
              that access system shall be followed. This shall be sending of an LLC PDU in a A/Gb mode cell or
              initiating the SERVICE REQUEST procedure in an Iu mode cell.

          -   If the MS is in a different access network (i.e. A/Gb mode or Iu mode), as when it last sent user data or
              signalling messages in a cell belonging to the RA where the MS is registered, the normal or combined RA
              update procedure shall be performed depending on the network operation mode in the current RA, before
              the sending of user data or signalling messages. If the signalling message is a DETACH REQUEST
              indicating "power off", the routing area updating procedure need not be performed.

          -   If the periodic routing area update timer expires the MS shall initiate the periodic RA update procedure.

       3) If the READY timer is not running in the network in A/Gb mode or the network is in PMM-IDLE mode in Iu
          mode, then the network shall page the MS if downlink user data or signalling information needs to be sent
          from the network to the MS. This shall include both A/Gb mode and Iu mode cells.

          -   If the MS receives the paging indication in the same access network (i.e. A/Gb mode or Iu mode), as
              when it last sent user data or signalling information in a cell belonging to the RA where the MS is
              registered, the MS shall send any LLC PDU in a A/Gb mode cell or shall initiate the service request
              procedure indicating service type "paging response" in an Iu mode cell.

          -   If the MS receives the paging indication in a different access network (i.e. A/Gb mode or Iu mode), as
              when it last sent user data or signalling information in a cell belonging to the RA where the MS is
              registered, the MS shall perform normal or combined routing area updating procedure shall be performed
              depending on the network operation mode in the current RA.

4.7.1.7b         Intersystem change from S1 mode to A/Gb mode or S1 mode to Iu mode for
                 eCall only MS capable of eCall over IMS
If an eCall only MS (as determined by information configured in USIM) capable of eCall over IMS returns from S1
mode to A/Gb or Iu mode, the MS shall:

   a) if timer T3444 is running, start timer T3242 with the time left on timer T3444, and stop timer T3444;

   b) if timer T3445 is running, start timer T3243 with the time left on timer T3445, and stop timer T3445;

   c) if the MS is attached for GPRS services only and timer T3444 or timer T3445 is running:

       -   perform a combined routing area updating procedure with IMSI attach if the network operates in network
           operation mode I; and

       -   perform a routing area updating procedure and a location area updating procedure if the network operates in
           network operation mode II; and

   d) if the MS is attached for both GPRS services and non-GPRS services and timer T3444 or timer T3445 is
      running:

       -   perform a combined routing area updating procedure if the network operates in network operation mode I;
           and

       -   perform a routing area updating procedure and a location are updating procedure if the network operates in
           network operation mode II.

   NOTE:      Timers T3444 and T3445 are specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 [120].

4.7.1.7c          Return to packet idle mode for eCall only MS capable of eCall over IMS
If an eCall only MS (as determined by information configured in USIM) capable of eCall over IMS returns to packet
idle mode following the release of a call to an HPLMN designated non-emergency MSISDN or URI for test or terminal
reconfiguration service which was handed over from S1 mode and timer T3243 is not running, the MS shall start timer
T3243.

4.7.1.8           List of forbidden PLMNs for GPRS service
The Mobile Equipment shall contain a list of "forbidden PLMNs for GPRS service". This lists shall be erased when the
MS is switched off or when the SIM/USIM is removed or upon the expiry of the timer T3245 as described in
subclause 4.1.1.6. The PLMN identification received on the BCCH shall be added to the list whenever a GPRS attach or
routing area update is rejected by the network with the cause "GPRS services not allowed in this PLMN" or whenever a
GPRS detach is initiated by the network with the cause "GPRS services not allowed in this PLMN".

In a shared network, the MS shall choose one of the PLMN identities as specified in 3GPP TS 23.122 [14]. The PLMN
identity selected for a GPRS attach procedure, or the PLMN identity used to construct the RAI that triggered the routing
area updating procedure shall be added to the list of "forbidden PLMNs for GPRS service" whenever such a procedure
is rejected by the network with the cause "GPRS services not allowed in this PLMN". Whenever a GPRS detach is
initiated by the network with the cause "GPRS services not allowed in this PLMN", the PLMN identity that was
selected for GPRS attach procedure or routing area update procedure shall be added to the list of "forbidden PLMNs for
GPRS service".

The maximum number of possible entries in this list is implementation dependent, but must be at least one entry. When
the list is full and a new entry has to be inserted, the oldest entry shall be deleted.

4.7.1.8a          Establishment of the PS signalling connection (Iu mode only)
In order to route the NAS message to an appropriate SGSN, the MS NAS provides the lower layers with the routing
parameter according to the following rules:

   a) if the TIN indicates "P-TMSI" or "RAT-related TMSI", and the MS holds a valid P-TMSI, the MS NAS shall
      provide the lower layers with the P-TMSI;

   b) if the TIN indicates "GUTI" and the MS holds a valid GUTI, the MS NAS shall provide the lower layers with
      the P-TMSI mapped from the GUTI (see 3GPP TS 23.003 [10]);

   c) if the TIN is not available and the MS holds a valid P-TMSI, the MS NAS shall provide the lower layers with the
      P-TMSI; or

   d) if the TIN is not available and the MS holds a valid GUTI, but no valid P-TMSI, the MS NAS shall provide the
      lower layers with the P-TMSI mapped from the GUTI (see 3GPP TS 23.003 [10]).

When an ATTACH REQUEST message, or a ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message after a routing area
change, is sent to establish a PS signalling connection, the MS NAS also provides the lower layers with the DCN-ID
according to the following rules:

   a) if a DCN-ID for the PLMN code of the selected PLMN is available in the MS, this DCN-ID the MS NAS shall
      provide this DCN-ID to the lower layers; or

   b) if no DCN-ID for the PLMN code of the selected PLMN is available but a Default_DCN_ID value is available in

      the Default_DCN_ID value MS NAS shall provide the Default_DCN_ID value to the lower layers.

4.7.1.9            Release of the PS signalling connection (Iu mode only)
In Iu mode, to allow the network to release the PS signalling connection (see 3GPP TS 25.331 [23c] and
3GPP TS 44.118 [111]) the MS:

   a) shall start the timer T3340 if the MS receives any of the reject cause values #11, #12, #13, #15 or #25;

   b) shall start the timer T3340 if the network indicates "no follow-on proceed" in the ROUTING AREA UPDATE
      ACCEPT or ATTACH ACCEPT message and user plane radio access bearers have not been setup;

   c) shall start the timer T3340 if the MS receives a DETACH ACCEPT message and the MS has set the detach type
      to "IMSI detach" in the DETACH REQUEST message and user plane radio access bearers have not been set up;
      or

   d) may start the timer T3340 if the MS receives any of the reject cause values #7 or #8.

Upon expiry of T3340, the MS shall release the established PS signalling connection (see 3GPP TS 25.331 [23c] and
3GPP TS 44.118 [111]).

Upon release of the established PS signalling connection, if timer T3243 is not running, the MS shall start timer T3243
when:

   -   the MS is an eCall only MS (as determined by information configured in USIM);

   -   the MS is capable of eCall over IMS; and

   -   the PS signalling connection that was released had been established for a call to an HPLMN designated non-
       emergency MSISDN or URI for test or terminal reconfiguration service which was handed over from S1 mode.

In case b, if the MS has signalling pending, then it shall request a new PS signalling connection for further signalling.

In case b and c,

   -   upon an indication from the lower layers that radio accesss bearer(s) is set up, the MS shall stop timer T3340 and
       may send uplink signalling via the existing PS signalling connection or user data via radio access bearer(s). If the
       MS is establishing a PDN connection for emergency bearer services or the MS is initiating a service request
       procedure to send user data for emergency bearer services, the MS shall send the uplink signalling via the
       existing PS signalling connection;

   -   upon receipt of a REQUEST PDP CONTEXT ACTIVATION message, MODIFY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST
       message, DEACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message, REQUEST SECONDARY PDP CONTEXT
       ACTIVATION message or REQUEST MBMS CONTEXT ACTIVATION message, the MS shall stop timer
       T3340 and may send uplink signalling via the existing PS signalling connection. If the MS is establishing a PDN
       connection for emergency bearer services or the MS is initiating a service request procedure to send user data for
       emergency bearer services, the MS shall send the uplink signalling via the existing PS signalling connection; or

   -   upon receipt of a DETACH REQUEST message, the MS shall stop timer T3340 and respond to the network
       initiated GPRS detach as specified in subclause 4.7.4.2.

If the MS receives the "Extended wait time" for PS domain from the lower layers when no attach, routing area updating
or service request procedure is ongoing, the MS shall ignore the "Extended wait time".

If the MS needs to perform PLMN selection, the MS may release the established PS signalling connection (see
3GPP TS 25.331 [23c] and 3GPP TS 44.118 [111]).

4.7.1.10          Handling of 3GPP PS data off
An MS, which supports 3GPP PS data off (see 3GPP TS 23.060 [74]), can be configured with up to two lists of 3GPP
PS data off exempt services as specified in 3GPP TS 24.368 [135] or in the EF3GPPPSDATAOFF USIM file as specified in
3GPP TS 31.102 [112]:

   -   a list of 3GPP PS data off exempt services to be used in the HPLMN or EHPLMN; and

   -   a list of 3GPP PS data off exempt services to be used in the VPLMN.

If only the list of 3GPP PS data off exempt services to be used in the HPLMN or EHPLMN is configured at the MS,
this list shall be also used in the VPLMN.

If the MS supports 3GPP PS data off, the MS shall provide the 3GPP PS data off UE status in the protocol configuration
options IE during PDP context activation procedure (see subclause 6.1.3.1).

The network informs the MS about the support of 3GPP PS data off during PDP context activation procedure as
specified in subclause 6.1.3.1. If 3GPP data off support is not indicated in the protocol configuration options IE in the
ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT ACCEPT message, the MS shall not indicate any change of 3GPP PS data off UE status
for the PDN connection established by the PDP context activation procedure; otherwise the MS shall indicate change of
the 3GPP PS data off UE status for the PDN connection by using the PDP context modification procedure as specified
in subclause 6.1.3.3. If the network does not provide indication of support of 3GPP PS data off during PDP context
activation procedure, the MS behaviour for non-exempt service requests from the network is implementation dependent.

When the 3GPP PS data off UE status is "activated":

   a) the MS does not send uplink IP packets except:

       -   for those services indicated in the list of 3GPP PS data off exempt services to be used in the HPLMN or
           EHPLMN as specified in 3GPP TS 24.368 [135] when the MS is in its HPLMN or EHPLMN;

       -   for those services indicated in the list of 3GPP PS data off exempt services to be used in the HPLMN or
           EHPLMN when the MS is in the VPLMN, if only the list of 3GPP PS data off exempt services to be used in
           the HPLMN or EHPLMN is configured to the MS as specified in 3GPP TS 24.368 [135];

       -   for those services indicated in the list of 3GPP PS data off exempt services to be used in the VPLMN when
           the MS is in the VPLMN, if the list of 3GPP PS data off exempt services to be used in the VPLMN is
           configured to the MS as specified in 3GPP TS 24.368 [135];

       -   for those services indicated in the EF3GPPPSDATAOFF USIM file as specified in 3GPP TS 31.102 [112]; and

       -   any uplink traffic due to procedures specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [13D]; and

   b) the MS does not send uplink non-IP user data packets.

Otherwise the MS sends uplink user data packets without restriction.

   NOTE:      If the MS supports 3GPP PS data off, uplink IP packets are filtered as specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [13D]
              in subclause B.3.1.5.


4.7.2         GPRS Mobility management timers and UMTS PS signalling
              connection control

4.7.2.1           READY timer behaviour

4.7.2.1.1            READY timer behaviour (A/Gb mode only)
The READY timer, T3314 is used in the MS and in the network per each assigned P-TMSI to control the cell updating
procedure.

When the READY timer is running or has been deactivated the MS shall perform cell update each time a new cell is
selected (see 3GPP TS 43.022 [82]). If a routing area border is crossed, a routing area updating procedure shall be
performed instead of a cell update.



                                                          ETSI
3GPP TS 24.008 version 15.8.0 Release 15                  148                        ETSI TS 124 008 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


When the READY timer has expired:

   -   the MS shall perform the routing area updating procedure when a routing area border is crossed;

   -   the MS shall not perform a cell update when a new cell is selected.

   -   the network shall page the MS if down-link user data or signalling information needs to be sent to the MS.

All other GMM procedures are not affected by the READY timer.

The READY timer is started:

   -   in the MS when the GMM entity receives an indication from lower layers that an LLC frame other than LLC
       NULL frame has been transmitted on the radio interface; and

   -   in the network when the GMM entity receives an indication from lower layers that an LLC frame other than LLC
       NULL frame has been successfully received by the network.

Within GMM signalling procedures the network includes a "force to standby" information element, in order to indicate
whether or not the READY timer shall be stopped when returning to the GMM-REGISTERED state. If the "force to
standby" information element is received within more than one message during a ongoing GMM specific procedure, the
last one received shall apply. If the READY timer is deactivated and the network indicates "force to standby" with the
"force to standby" information element, this shall not cause a modification of the READY timer.

The READY timer is not affected by state transitions to and from the GMM-REGISTERED.SUSPENDED sub-state.

The value of the READY timer may be negotiated between the MS and the network using the GPRS attach or GPRS
routing area updating procedure.

   -   If the MS wishes to indicate its preference for a READY timer value it shall include the preferred values into the
       ATTACH REQUEST and/or ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST messages. The preferred values may be
       smaller, equal to or greater than the default values or may be equal to the value requesting the READY Timer
       function to be deactivated.

   -   Regardless of whether or not a timer value has been received by the network in the ATTACH REQUEST or
       ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST messages, the network may include a timer value for the READY timer
       (different or not from the default value) into the ATTACH ACCEPT or ROUTING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT
       messages, respectively. If the READY Timer value was included, it shall be applied for the GMM context by the
       network and by the MS.

   -   When the MS proposes a READY Timer value and the Network does not include any READY Timer Value in
       its answer, then the value proposed by the MS shall be applied for the GMM context by the Network and by the
       MS.

   -   When neither the MS nor the Network proposes a READY Timer value into the ATTACH REQUEST/ATTACH
       ACCEPT or ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST/ROUTING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, then the
       default value shall be used.

If the negotiated READY timer value indicates that the ready timer function is deactivated, the READY timer shall
always run without expiry. If the negotiated READY timer value indicates that the ready timer function is deactivated,
and within the same procedure the network indicates "force to standby" with the "force to standby" information
element, the READY timer shall always run without expiry. If the negotiated READY timer value is set to zero, the
READY timer shall be stopped immediately.

To account for the LLC frame uplink transmission delay, the READY timer value should be slightly shorter in the
network than in the MS. This is a network implementation issue.

If a new READY timer value is negotiated, the MS shall upon the reception of the ATTACH ACCEPT or ROUTING
AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message perform an initial cell update (either by transmitting a LLC frame or, if required, a
ATTACH COMPLETE or ROUTING AREA UPDATE COMPLETE message), in order to apply the new READY
timer value immediately. If both the network and the MS support the Cell Notification, the initial cell update shall use
any LLC frame except the LLC NULL frame. If the new READY timer value is set to zero or if the network indicates
"force to standby" with the "force to standby" IE, the initial cell update should not be done.

4.7.2.1.2            Handling of READY timer in the MS in Iu mode and S1 mode
The READY timer is not applicable for Iu mode in S1 mode.

Upon completion of a successful GPRS attach or routing area updating procedure in Iu mode, the MS shall stop the
READY timer, if running.

Upon completion of a successful EPS attach or tracking area updating procedure, the MS shall stop the READY timer,
if running.

In Iu mode, an MS may indicate a READY timer value to the network in the ATTACH REQUEST and the ROUTING
AREA UPDATE REQUEST messages.

If a READY timer value is received by an MS capable of both Iu mode and A/Gb mode in the ATTACH ACCEPT or
the ROUTING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, then the MS shall store the received value in order to use it at an
intersystem change from Iu mode to A/Gb mode.

4.7.2.1.2a           Handling of READY timer in the network in Iu mode and S1 mode
The READY timer is not applicable for Iu mode in S1 mode.

Upon completion of a successful GPRS attach or routing area updating procedure, the network shall stop the READY
timer, if running.

When the SGSN is informed by the HLR/HSS that the MS performed an EPS attach or by the MME that the UE is
performing a tracking area updating procedure, the SGSN shall stop the READY timer, if running.

4.7.2.2           Periodic routing area updating
The periodic routing area updating procedure is used to periodically notify the availability of the MS to the network.
The procedure is controlled in the MS by timer T3312. The value of timer T3312 is sent by the network to the MS in the
messages ATTACH ACCEPT and ROUTING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT. The value of timer T3312 shall be unique
within a RA.

If the value of timer T3312 received by the MS in A/Gb mode or received in Iu mode in a message with integrity
protection contains an indication that the timer is deactivated or the timer value is zero, then timer T3312 is deactivated
and the MS shall not perform the periodic routing area updating procedure.

In Iu mode, if the value of timer T3312 is received in a message without integrity protection and the indicated value is
larger than the last received value, or the indicated value is "deactivated" or zero, the MS shall use the last received
value. If there is no last received value, then the MS shall use the default value.

In A/Gb mode, the timer T3312 is reset and started with its initial value, when the READY timer is stopped or expires.
Timer T3312 is stopped and shall be set to its initial value for the next start when the READY timer is started. If after a
READY timer negotiation the READY timer value is set to zero, timer T3312 is reset and started with its initial value.
If the initial READY timer value is zero, the timer T3312 is reset and started with its initial value, when the ROUTING
AREA UPDATE REQUEST message is transmitted.

In Iu mode, timer T3312 is reset and started with its initial value, when the MS changes from PMM-CONNECTED to
PMM-IDLE mode. Timer T3312 is stopped when the MS enters PMM-CONNECTED mode.

If the MS is attached for emergency bearer services, when timer T3312 expires, the MS shall not initiate a periodic
routing area updating procedure, but shall locally detach from the network. When the MS is camping on a suitable cell,
it may re-attach to regain normal service.

If the MS is not attached for emergency bearer services, when timer T3312 expires, the periodic routing area updating
procedure shall be started and timer T3312 shall be set to its initial value for the next start.

If the MS is in a state other than GMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE when timer T3312 expires, the periodic
routing area updating procedure is delayed until the MS returns to GMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE.

In A/Gb mode, if the MS in MS operation mode B is in the state GMM-REGISTERED.SUSPENDED when timer
T3312 expires the periodic routing area updating procedure is delayed until the state is left.

If ISR is activated, the MS shall keep both timer T3412 and timer T3312. The two separate timers run in the MS for
updating the MME and the SGSN independently. The MS shall start timer T3323 if timer T3312 expires, and timer
T3346 is running or the MS is in one of the following states:

   -   GMM-REGISTERED.NO-CELL-AVAILABLE;

   -   GMM-REGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH;

   -   GMM-REGISTERED.UPDATE-NEEDED; or

   -   GMM-REGISTERED.LIMITED-SERVICE.

The MS shall initiate the routing area updating procedure and stop timer T3323 when the MS enters the state GMM-
REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE before timer T3323 expires. After expiry of timer T3323 the MS shall deactivate
ISR by setting its TIN to "GUTI".

If timer T3323 expires, the MS shall memorize that it has to initiate a routing area updating procedure when it returns to
state GMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE.

The network supervises the periodic routing area updating procedure by means of the mobile reachable timer.

If the MS is not attached for emergency bearer services, the mobile reachable timer shall be longer than timer T3312. In
this case, by default, the mobile reachable timer is 4 minutes greater than timer T3312.

   NOTE 1: According to subclause 4.7.5.1.5, if a periodic routing area updating procedure fails repeatedly, it can take
           more than 7 minutes before the MS starts using MM specific procedures.

The network may include timer T3312 extended value IE in the ATTACH ACCEPT message or ROUTING AREA
UPDATE ACCEPT message only if the MS indicates support of the timer T3312 extended value in the MS network
feature support IE.

If the network includes the timer T3312 extended value IE in the ATTACH ACCEPT message or ROUTING AREA
UPDATE ACCEPT message, the network shall use the timer T3312 extended value IE as the value of timer T3312.

If ISR is not activated, when the mobile reachable timer expires, typically the network stops sending paging messages
to the mobile and may take other appropriate actions.

If the MS is attached for emergency bearer services, the SGSN shall set the mobile reachable timer with a value equal to
timer T3312. When the mobile reachable timer expires, the SGSN shall locally detach the MS.

In A/Gb mode, the mobile reachable timer is reset and started with the value as indicated above, when the READY
timer is stopped or expires. The mobile reachable timer is stopped when the READY timer is started.

In A/Gb mode, if after a READY timer negotiation the READY timer value is set to zero, the mobile reachable timer is
reset and started with its initial value. If the initial READY timer value is zero, the mobile reachable timer is reset and
started with its initial value, when the ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message is received.

In Iu mode, the mobile reachable timer is reset and started with the value as indicated above, when the MS changes
from PMM-CONNECTED to PMM-IDLE mode. The mobile reachable timer is stopped when the MS enters PMM-
CONNECTED mode.

If ISR is activated, upon expiry of the mobile reachable timer the network shall start the implicit detach timer. By
default, the implicit detach timer is 4 minutes greater than timer T3323. If the implicit detach timer expires before the
MS contacts the network, the network shall implicitly detach the MS and deactivate ISR.

If ISR is not activated, upon expiry of the mobile reachable timer the network may start the implicit detach timer. The
value of the implicit detach timer is network dependent. If the implicit detach timer expires before the MS contacts the
network, the network shall implicitly detach the MS.

If the network includes the T3324 value IE in the ATTACH ACCEPT message or ROUTING AREA UPDATE
ACCEPT message and if the MS is not attached for emergency bearer services and has no PDN connection for
emergency bearer services, the network shall set the active timer to a value equal to the value of timer T3324.

If the MS has established a PDN connection for emergency bearer services after receiving the timer T3324 value IE in
the ATTACH ACCEPT message or ROUTING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, the active timer shall not be
started.

When the active timer expires, typically the network stops sending paging messages to the mobile and may take other
appropriate actions.

In A/Gb mode, the active timer is reset and started with the value as indicated above, when the READY timer is stopped
or expires. The active timer is stopped when the READY timer is started.

In Iu mode, the active timer is reset and started with the value as indicated above, when the MS changes from PMM-
CONNECTED to PMM-IDLE mode. The active timer is stopped when the MS enters PMM-CONNECTED mode.

   NOTE 2: ISR is not activated when the network includes the T3324 value IE in the ATTACH ACCEPT message or
           ROUTING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message.

If the SGSN includes timer T3346 in the ROUTING AREA UPDATE REJECT message or the SERVICE REJECT
message and timer T3346 is greater than timer T3312, the SGSN sets the mobile reachable timer and the implicit detach
timer such that the sum of the timer values is greater than timer T3346.

   NOTE 3: According to subclause 4.7.5.1.5, if a periodic routing area updating procedure fails repeatedly, it can take
           more than 7 minutes before the MS starts using MM specific procedures.

If the MS is both IMSI attached for GPRS and non-GPRS services, and if the MS lost coverage of the registered PLMN
and timer T3312 expires or timer T3323 expires, then:

   a) if the MS returns to coverage in a cell that supports GPRS and that indicates that the network is in network
      operation mode I, then the MS shall either perform the combined routing area update procedure indicating
      "combined RA/LA updating with IMSI attach"; or

   b) if the MS returns to coverage in a cell in the same RA that supports GPRS and that indicates that the network is
      in network operation mode II, then the MS shall perform the periodic routing area updating procedure indicating
      "Periodic updating"; or

   c) if the MS was both IMSI attached for GPRS and non-GPRS services in network operation mode I and the MS
      returns to coverage in a cell in the same LA that does not support GPRS, then the MS shall perform the periodic
      location updating procedure. In addition, the MS shall perform a combined routing area update procedure
      indicating "combined RA/LA updating with IMSI attach" when the MS enters a cell that supports GPRS and that
      indicates that the network is in network operation mode I; or

   d) if the MS returns to coverage in a new RA, the description given in subclause 4.7.5 applies.

If this subclause specifies that the MS shall perform a periodic routing area updating procedure, but subclause 4.7.5
specifies the MS shall perform a normal or combined routing area updating procedure, the description in
subclause 4.7.5 takes precedence.

If the MS is both IMSI attached for GPRS and non-GPRS services in a network that operates in network operation
mode I, and if the MS has camped on a cell that does not support GPRS, and timer T3312 expires or timer T3323
expires, then the MS shall start an MM location updating procedure. In addition, the MS shall perform a combined
routing area update procedure indicating "combined RA/LA updating with IMSI attach" when the MS enters a cell that
supports GPRS and indicates that the network is in operation mode I.

If timer T3312 expires or timer T3323 expires during an ongoing CS connection, then a MS operating in MS operation
mode B shall treat the expiry of T3312 when the MM state MM-IDLE is entered, analogous to the descriptions for the
cases when the timer expires out of coverage or in a cell that does not support GPRS.

In A/Gb mode, timer T3312 and timer T3323 shall not be stopped when a GPRS MS enters state GMM-
REGISTERED.SUSPENDED.

4.7.2.3          PMM-IDLE mode and PMM-CONNECTED mode (Iu mode only)
An MS shall enter PMM-CONNECTED mode when a PS signalling connection for packet switched domain is
established between the MS and the network. The MS shall not perform periodic routing area update in PMM-
CONNECTED mode.

An MS shall enter PMM-IDLE mode when the PS signalling connection for packet switched domain between the MS
and the network has been released. The MS shall perform periodic routing area update in PMM-IDLE mode.

4.7.2.4          Handling of Force to standby in Iu mode (Iu mode only)
Force to standby is not applicable for Iu mode.

The network shall always indicate Force to standby not indicated in the Force to standby information element.

The Force to standby information element shall be ignored by the MS.

4.7.2.5          RA Update procedure for Signalling Connection Re-establishment (Iu mode
                 only)
When the MS receives an indication from the lower layers that the RRC connection has been released with cause
"Directed signalling connection re-establishment", see 3GPP TS 25.331 [23c] and 3GPP TS 44.118 [111], then the MS
shall enter PMM-IDLE mode and initiate immediately a normal routing area update procedure (the use of normal or
combined procedure depends on the network operation mode in the current serving cell) regardless whether the routing
area has been changed since the last update or not. This routing area update procedure shall also be performed or
continued if the MS has performed an inter-system change towards GSM, irrespective whether the READY timer is
running or the MS is in PMM-IDLE or PMM-CONNECTED mode.

4.7.2.6          Cell Update triggered by low layers
A Cell Update may be requested by the low layers, see 3GPP TS 44.060 [76]. In this case the Cell Update shall be
performed even if the READY timer is not running. If both the network and the MS support the Cell Notification, then
the MS shall use the LLC NULL frame to perform the Cell Update.

4.7.2.7          Handling of timer T3302
The value of timer T3302 can be sent by the network to the MS in the ATTACH ACCEPT message, ROUTING AREA
UPDATE ACCEPT message, ATTACH REJECT message, and ROUTING AREA UPDATE REJECT message. The
MS shall apply this value, if the value is different from "deactivated" in the routing area registered by the MS, until a
new value is received. The default value of this timer is used in the following cases:

   -   ATTACH ACCEPT message, ROUTING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, ATTACH REJECT message, or
       ROUTING AREA UPDATE REJECT message is received without a value specified;

   -   In Iu mode, if the network provides a value in a non-integrity protected Iu mode GMM message and the MS is
       not attaching for emergency services or not attached for emergency services;

   -   In A/Gb mode and if the MS supports integrity protection, if the network provides a value in a non-integrity
       protected GMM message;

   -   the network indicates that the timer is "deactivated";

   -   the MS does not have a stored value for this timer;

   -   a new PLMN which is not in the list of equivalent PLMNs has been entered, the routing area updating fails and
       the routing area updating attempt counter is equal to 5; or

   -   a new PLMN which is not in the list of equivalent PLMNs has been entered, the attach procedure fails, and the
       attach attempt counter is equal to 5.

4.7.2.8          Handling of timer T3324 (A/Gb mode, Iu mode and S1 mode)
An MS supporting PSM may request the network to assign a value for T3324 by including a requested timer value in:

   -   the ATTACH REQUEST or ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message (in A/Gb mode and Iu mode ); or

   -   the ATTACH REQUEST or TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message (in S1 mode).

The value of timer T3324 can be sent by the network to the MS in:

   -   the ATTACH ACCEPT or ROUTING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message (in A/Gb mode and Iu mode ); and

   -   the ATTACH ACCEPT or TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message (in S1 mode).

   NOTE:      Besides the value requested by the MS, the network can take local configuration into account when
              selecting a value for T3324 (see 3GPP TS 23.682 [133A], subclause 4.5.4).

In A/Gb mode and Iu mode, the MS shall apply the received T3324 value in the RA identified by the RAI contained in
the ATTACH ACCEPT or ROUTING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, until a new value is received, T3324 is
deactivated or a new PLMN is selected. The timer T3324 is deactivated if:

   -   the last attach or routing area updating attempt was not completed successfully;

   -   the network does not include a value for timer T3324 in the last ATTACH ACCEPT or ROUTING AREA
       UPDATE ACCEPT message received by the MS; or

   -   the indicated value of the timer is "deactivated".

In A/Gb mode and Iu mode, timer T3324 is reset and started with its initial value, when the MS changes from PMM-
CONNECTED mode to PMM-IDLE mode (in Iu mode) or when the READY timer is stopped or expires (in A/Gb
mode). Timer T3324 is stopped when the MS enters PMM-CONNECTED mode or GMM-DEREGISTERED state or
the READY timer is started.

In S1 mode, the MS shall apply the received T3324 value in all tracking areas of the list of tracking areas assigned to
the MS, until a new value is received, T3324 is deactivated or a new PLMN is selected. The timer T3324 is deactivated
if:

   -   the last attach or tracking area updating attempt was not completed successfully;

   -   the network does not include a value for timer T3324 in the last ATTACH ACCEPT or TRACKING AREA
       UPDATE ACCEPT message received by the MS; or

   -   the indicated value of the timer is "deactivated".

In S1 mode, timer T3324 is reset and started with its initial value, when the MS changes from EMM-CONNECTED
mode to EMM-IDLE mode. Timer T3324 is stopped when the MS enters EMM-CONNECTED mode or EMM-
DEREGISTERED state.In A/Gb mode and Iu mode, when timer T3324 expires the MS may activate PSM as specified
in subclause 4.7.2.9.

In S1 mode, when timer T3324 expires the MS may activate PSM as specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 [120],
subclause 5.3.11.

In A/Gb mode and Iu mode, if timer T3324 expires during an ongoing CS connection, the MS shall take action on the
expiry of timer T3324 as described in subclause 4.7.2.9 when the MM state MM-IDLE is entered.

4.7.2.9           Power saving mode
The MS can request the use of power saving mode (PSM) during an attach or routing area updating procedures (see
3GPP TS 23.682 [133A] and 3GPP TS 23.060 [74]). The MS shall not request the use of PSM during:

   -   an attach for emergency bearer services procedure;

   -   a routing area updating procedure for initiating a PDN connection for emergency bearer services; or

   -   a routing area updating procedure when the MS has a PDN connection established for emergency bearer
       services.

The network accepts the use of PSM by providing a specific value for timer T3324 when accepting the attach or routing
area updating procedure. The MS may use PSM only if the network has provided the T3324 value IE during the last
attach or routing area updating procedure with a value different from "deactivated".

Upon expiry of the timer T3324 or if the T3324 value provided by the network is zero, the MS may deactivate the AS
layer and activate PSM by entering the state GMM-REGISTERED.NO-CELL-AVAILABLE if:

   a) the MS is not attached for emergency bearer services;

   b) the MS has no PDN connection for emergency bearer services;




                                                            ETSI
3GPP TS 24.008 version 15.8.0 Release 15                  154                       ETSI TS 124 008 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


   c) the MS is in PMM-IDLE mode (in Iu mode) or the READY timer is not running (in A/Gb mode);

   d) the MS is in the GMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE state; and

   e) no RR connection exists.

If conditions a, b, c and e are fulfilled, but the MS is in a state other than GMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE
when timer T3324 expires, the MS may activate PSM when the MS returns to state GMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-
SERVICE.

If conditions a, b, c and d are fulfilled, but an RR connection exists, the MS may activate PSM when the RR connection
has been released.

An MS that has already been allocated timer T3324 with a value different from "deactivated" and the timer T3324 has
expired, may activate PSM if it receives an "Extended wait time" from lower layers.

When PSM is activated all NAS timers are stopped and associated procedures aborted except for timers T3312, T3346,
T3396, any backoff timers, and the timer T controlling the periodic search for HPLMN or EHPLMN or higher
prioritized PLMNs (see 3GPP TS 23.122 [14]).

If the MS is attached for emergency bearer services or has a PDN connection for emergency bearer services, the MS
shall not activate PSM.

The MS may deactivate PSM at any time (e.g. for transfer of mobile originated signalling or user data, or to initiate a
mobile originated circuit-switched transaction), by activating the AS layer before initiating the necessary GMM or MM
procedures (if any).

4.7.2.10         Extended idle-mode DRX cycle
The MS can request the use of extended idle mode DRX cycle (eDRX) during an attach or routing area updating
procedure by including the extended DRX parameters IE (see 3GPP TS 23.682 [11A] and 3GPP TS 23.060 [74]). The
MS shall not request the use of eDRX during:

   -   an attach for emergency bearer services procedure; or

   -   a routing area updating procedure for the MS attached for emergency bearer services.

The MS and the network may negotiate eDRX parameters during a routing area updating procedure when the MS has a
PDP context for emergency bearer services.

The network accepts the request to use eDRX by providing the extended DRX parameters IE when accepting the attach
or the routing area updating procedure. The MS shall use extended idle mode DRX cycle only if it received the
extended DRX parameters IE during the last attach or routing area updating procedure and the MS does not have a PDP
context for emergency bearer services.

   NOTE:      If the MS wants to keep using eDRX, the MS includes the extended DRX parameters IE in each attach or
              routing area updating procedure.

If the MS received the extended DRX parameters IE during the last attach or routing area updating procedure, upon the
successful completion of the PDP context deactivation procedure for a PDP context for emergency bearer services, the
MS shall resume eDRX.

If the network has provided the extended DRX parameters IE during the last attach or routing area updating procedure,
upon the successful completion of the PDP context deactivation procedure for a PDP context for emergency bearer
services, the network shall resume eDRX.

If the MS or the network locally deactivates the PDP context for emergency bearer service, the MS or the network shall
not use eDRX until the MS receives eDRX parameters during a routing area updating procedure with PDP context
synchronization or upon successful completion of a service request procedure.

If the MS did not receive the extended DRX parameters IE, or if the MS has a PDP context for emergency bearer
services, the MS shall use the stored DRX parameters, if available.

If the network did not accept the request to use eDRX, or if the MS has a PDP context for emergency bearer services,
the network shall use the stored DRX parameters, if available.

3GPP TS 24.008 version 15.8.0 Release 15                   155                        ETSI TS 124 008 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


4.7.2.11          Interaction between power saving mode and extended idle mode DRX cycle
The MS can request the use of both PSM and eDRX during an attach or routing area update procedure but it is up to the
network to decide to enable none, one of them or both (see 3GPP TS 23.682 [133A] and 3GPP TS 23.060 [74]).

If the network accepts the use of both PSM (see subclause 4.7.1.9) and eDRX (see subclause 4.7.2.10), the extended
DRX parameters IE provided to the MS should allow for multiple paging occasions before the active timer expires.

4.7.2.12          Extended coverage for GSM
The MS can support and use the extended coverage in GSM for IoT (EC-GSM-IoT) feature (see
3GPP TS 43.064 [159]). A GPRS MS using EC-GSM-IoT may operate in MS operation mode C only. If the MS uses
one of the four coverage classes of EC-GSM-IoT as defined in 3GPP TS 43.064 [159], the MS shall calculate the value
of the applicable NAS timers as indicated in tables 11.3, 11.3A and 11.2c using a multiplier of 3. The NAS timer value
obtained is used as described in the appropriate procedure subclause of this specification. The NAS timer value shall be
calculated at start of a NAS procedure and shall not be re-calculated until the NAS procedure is completed, restarted or
aborted.

The usage of one of the four coverage classes of EC-GSM-IoT by an MS is indicated to the SGSN by lower layers.
When a SGSN that supports EC-GSM-IoT performs NAS signaling with an MS that is using EC-GSM-IoT, the SGSN
shall calculate the value of the applicable NAS timers as indicated in tables 11.4, 11.4a and 11.2d using a multiplier of
3. The NAS timer value shall be calculated at start of a NAS procedure and shall not be re-calculated until the NAS
procedure is completed, restarted or aborted.

In order to deal with use of extensive resources from the network, the operator may prevent specific subscribers from
using enhanced coverage (see 3GPP TS 23.060 [74]). When in A/Gb mode, the MS supporting EC-GSM-IoT shall
indicate support for restriction on use of enhanced coverage. The MS supporting restriction on use of enhanced
coverage indicates "Mobile station supports restriction on use of enhanced coverage" in the MS network capability
information element in the ATTACH REQUEST and ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message. If the MS
supports restriction on use of enhanced coverage, the SGSN indicates whether the use of enhanced coverage is
restricted or not in the ATTACH ACCEPT message and ROUTING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message (see
subclause 4.7.3.1 and subclause 4.7.5.1). If the use of enhanced coverage is restricted the MS shall not use enhanced
coverage in the registered PLMN and in any PLMN which is in the list of equivalent PLMNs.


4.7.3         GPRS attach procedure
The GPRS attach procedure is used for the following purposes:

   -   normal GPRS attach, performed by the MS to IMSI attach for GPRS services only. The normal GPRS attach
       procedure shall be used:

       -   by GPRS MSs in MS operation mode C, independent of the network operation mode;

       -   by GPRS MSs in MS operation modes A or B if the network operates in network operation mode II; and

       -   by GPRS MSs in MS operation mode A, independent of the network operation mode, if a circuit-switched
           transaction is ongoing;

   -   combined GPRS attach procedure, used by GPRS MSs in MS operation modes A or B to attach the IMSI for
       GPRS and non-GPRS services provided that the network operates in network operation mode I.

   -   GPRS attach for emergency bearer services, performed by the MS to IMSI or IMEI attach to emergency bearer
       services.

The lower layers indicate to NAS that the network does not support emergency bearer services for the MS in limited
service state (see 3GPP TS 25.331 [23c]). This information is taken into account when deciding whether to initiate
attach for emergency bearer services.

With a successful GPRS attach procedure a GMM context is established.

When the timer T3346 is running, MS is allowed to initiate an attach procedure if:

   -   the MS is an MS configured to use AC11 – 15 in selected PLMN;




                                                          ETSI
3GPP TS 24.008 version 15.8.0 Release 15                    156                        ETSI TS 124 008 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


   -   the MS is attaching for emergency bearer services; or

   -   the MS has timer T3346 running because a request from an MS with the low priority indicator set to "MS is
       configured for NAS signalling low priority" was rejected, and the MS needs to attach without the low priority
       indicator, or with the low priority indicator set to "MS is not configured for NAS signalling low priority".

An eCall only mobile station that is not capable of eCall over IMS shall not perform a normal or combined GPRS attach
procedure.

An eCall only mobile station that is capable of eCall over IMS may perform a normal or combined GPRS attach
procedure only upon failure of a routing area updating procedure following intersystem change from S1 mode to A/Gb
or Iu mode.

When the MS moves from NG-RAN coverage to GERAN coverage, or from NG-RAN coverage to UTRAN coverage,
the MS shall perform a normal or combined GPRS attach procedure.

Subclause 4.7.3.1 describes the GPRS attach procedure to attach the IMSI only for GPRS services. The combined
GPRS attach procedure used to attach the IMSI for both GPRS and non-GPRS services is described in
subclause 4.7.3.2. GPRS attach for emergency bearer services is described as part of subclause 4.7.3.1.

If an IMSI attach for non-GPRS services is requested and a GMM context exists, the routing area updating procedure
shall be used as described in subclause 4.7.5.2.

To limit the number of consecutive rejected attach attempts, a GPRS attach attempt counter is introduced. The GPRS
attach attempt counter shall be incremented as specified in subclause 4.7.3.1.5. Depending on the value of the GPRS
attach attempt counter, specific actions shall be performed. The GPRS attach attempt counter shall be reset when:

   -   the MS is powered on;

   -   a SIM/USIM is inserted;

   -   a GPRS attach or combined GPRS attach procedure is successfully completed;

   -   an attach or combined attach procedure is successfully completed in S1 mode;

   -   a combined GPRS attach procedure is completed for GPRS services only with cause #2, #16, #17, #22 or #28;

   -   a GPRS attach or combined GPRS attach procedure is rejected with cause #11, #12, #13, #14 ,#15 or #25;

   -   a network initiated detach procedure is completed with cause #11, #12, #13, #14, #15 or #25; or

   -   a new PLMN is selected;

   and additionally when the MS is in substate ATTEMPTING-TO-ATTACH:

   -   expiry of timer T3302;

   -   a new routing area is entered;

   -   an attach is triggered by CM sublayer requests;

   -   timer T3346 is started.

The mobile equipment shall contain a list of "forbidden location areas for roaming", as well as a list of "forbidden
location areas for regional provision of service". The handling of these lists is described in subclause 4.4.1; the same
lists are used by GMM and MM procedures.

In a shared network, the MS shall choose one of the PLMN identities as specified in 3GPP TS 23.122 [14]. The MS
shall construct the Routing Area Identification of the cell from this chosen PLMN identity, and the LAC and the RAC
received on the BCCH. For:

   -   a shared GERAN, in A/Gb mode, the chosen PLMN identity is indicated to the GERAN in the first RLC data
       block of an upper layer PDU (see 3GPP TS 44.060 [76]) when a foreign TLLI or a random TLLI is used by the
       network sharing supporting MS for the transmission.

   -   a shared UTRAN, the chosen PLMN identity shall be indicated to the UTRAN in the RRC INITIAL DIRECT
       TRANSFER message (see 3GPP TS 25.331 [23c]).

For GERAN Iu mode, network sharing is not supported.

Whenever an ATTACH REJECT message with the cause "PLMN not allowed" is received by the MS, the chosen
PLMN indentity shall be stored in the "forbidden PLMN list" and if the MS is configured to use timer T3245 (see
3GPP TS 24.368 [135] or 3GPP TS 31.102 [112]) then the MS shall start timer T3245 and proceed as described in
subclause 4.1.1.6. Whenever an ATTACH REJECT message is received by the MS with the cause "Roaming not
allowed in this location area", "Location Area not allowed", or "No suitable cells in Location Area", the LAI that is part
of the constructed RAI shall be stored in the suitable list.

The network informs the MS about the support of specific features, such as LCS-MOLR, MBMS, IMS voice over PS
session, emergency bearer services in Iu mode in the Network feature supporti nformation element. The information is
either explicitly given by sending the Network feature support IE or implicitly by not sending it. The handling in the
network is described in subclause 9.4.2.9. The network can also use the Additional network feature support IE in order
to inform the MS about the support of specific features such as the delivery of SMS via GPRS (GPRS-SMS) or
implicitly by not sending it. The MS may use the support indications for LCS-MOLR, MBMS and GPRS-SMS to
inform the user about the availability of the appropriate services. The MS shall not request the LCS-MOLR or MBMS
services, if the service has not been indicated as available. The indication for MBMS is defined in subclause "MBMS
feature support indication" in 3GPP TS 23.246 [106]. In an MS with IMS voice over PS capability, the IMS voice over
PS session indicator and the emergency bearer services indicator shall be provided to the upper layers. The upper layers
take the IMS voice over PS session indicator into account as specified in 3GPP TS 23.221 [131], subclause 7.2a and
subclause 7.2b, when selecting the access domain for voice sessions or calls in Iu mode. When initiating an emergency
call in Iu mode, the upper layers also take the emergency bearer services indicator into account for the access domain
selection. The MS may use the GPRS-SMS indication in order to obtain SMS.

4.7.3.1           GPRS attach procedure for GPRS services
The GPRS attach procedure is a GMM procedure used by GPRS MSs to IMSI attach for GPRS services. The procedure
is also used by GPRS MSs to IMSI or IMEI attach for emergency bearer services.

The attach type information element shall indicate "GPRS attach". For an MS attaching for emergency bearer services
the attach type information element shall indicate "Emergency attach".

4.7.3.1.1              GPRS attach procedure initiation
In state GMM-DEREGISTERED, the MS initiates the GPRS attach procedure by sending an ATTACH REQUEST
message to the network, starts timer T3310 and enters state GMM-REGISTERED-INITIATED. If timer T3302 is
currently running, the MS shall stop timer T3302. If timer T3311 is currently running, the MS shall stop timer T3311.

If the MS is configured for "AttachWithIMSI" as specified in 3GPP TS 24.368 [135] or 3GPP TS 31.102 [112] and the
selected PLMN is neither the registered PLMN nor in the list of equivalent PLMNs, the MS shall include the IMSI in
the Mobile identity IE in the ATTACH REQUEST message.

For all other cases:

   If the MS does not support S1 mode:

   -   the MS capable of both Iu mode and A/Gb mode or only of A/Gb mode shall include a valid P-TMSI, if any is
       available, the P-TMSI signature associated with the P-TMSI and the routing area identity associated with the P-
       TMSI in the ATTACH REQUEST message. In addition, the MS shall include P-TMSI type IE with P-TMSI
       type set to "native P-TMSI". If there is no valid P-TMSI available, the IMSI shall be included instead of the P-
       TMSI and P-TMSI signature.

   If the MS supports S1 mode:

   -   if the TIN indicates "GUTI" and the MS holds a valid GUTI, the MS shall map the GUTI into the Mobile
       identity IE, P-TMSI signature IE and Old routing area identification IE. The MS shall also include P-TMSI type
       IE with P-TMSI type set to "mapped P-TMSI". Additionally, if the MS holds a valid P-TMSI and RAI, the MS
       shall indicate the P-TMSI in the Additional mobile identity IE and the RAI in the Additional old routing area
       identification IE.

   NOTE:      The mapping of the GUTI to the P-TMSI, P-TMSI signature and RAI is specified in
              3GPP TS 23.003 [10].

   -   If the TIN indicates "P-TMSI" or "RAT-related TMSI" and the MS holds a valid P-TMSI and a RAI, the MS
       shall indicate the P-TMSI in the Mobile identity IE and the RAI in the Old routing area identification IE. The
       MS shall also include P-TMSI type IE with P-TMSI type set to "native P-TMSI". If a P-TMSI signature is
       associated with the P-TMSI, the MS shall include it in the Old P-TMSI signature IE.

   -   If the TIN is deleted and

       -   the MS holds a valid P-TMSI and a RAI, the MS shall indicate the P-TMSI in the Mobile identity IE and the
           RAI in the Old routing area identification IE. The MS shall also include P-TMSI type IE with P-TMSI type
           set to "native P-TMSI". If a P-TMSI signature is associated with the P-TMSI, the MS shall include it in the
           Old P-TMSI signature IE; or

       -   the MS does not hold a valid P-TMSI and RAI, but holds a valid GUTI, the MS shall map the GUTI into the
           Mobile identity IE, P-TMSI signature IE and Old routing area identification IE. The MS shall also include P-
           TMSI type IE with P-TMSI type set to "mapped P-TMSI"; or

       -   the MS does not hold a valid P-TMSI, RAI or GUTI, the MS shall include the IMSI in the Mobile identity IE.

   -   Otherwise the MS shall include the IMSI in the Mobile identity IE.

In the cases when the MS maps a GUTI into the Mobile identity IE, P-TMSI signature IE and Old routing area
identification IE, then:

   -   If a current EPS security exists, the P-TMSI signature shall include a truncated NAS token as specified in
       3GPP TS 33.401 [123]. In the GPRS ciphering key sequence number IE, the MS shall indicate the value of the
       eKSI associated with the current EPS security context. The MS shall derive CK' and IK' from the KASME and the
       NAS uplink COUNT value corresponding to the NAS token derived and handle the START value as specified in
       3GPP TS 25.331 [23c]. Then, the MS shall store the mapped UMTS security context replacing the established
       UMTS security context for the PS domain.

   -   If a current EPS security does not exist, the MS shall set the truncated NAS token included in the P-TMSI
       signature to all zeros and the GPRS ciphering key sequence number to "No key is available".

If the MS is attaching for emergency bearer services and does not hold a valid GUTI, P-TMSI or IMSI as described
above, the IMEI shall be included in the Mobile identity IE.

The MS shall also indicate within the DRX parameters whether it supports the split pg cycle option on CCCH. The
optional support of the split pg cycle on CCCH by the network is indicated in SI13 or PSI1. Split pg cycle on CCCH is
applied by both the network and the MS when the split pg cycle option is supported by both (see 3GPP TS 45.002 [32]).

If the MS supports eDRX and requests the use of eDRX, the MS shall include the extended DRX parameters IE in the
ATTACH REQUEST message.

In Iu mode, if the MS wishes to prolong the established PS signalling connection after the GPRS attach procedure (for
example, the MS has any CM application request pending), it may set a follow-on request pending indicator on (see
subclause 4.7.13).

An MS attaching for emergency bearer services shall set the follow-on request pending indicator.

If the MS supports PSM and requests the use of PSM, then the MS shall include the T3324 value IE with a requested
timer value in the ATTACH REQUEST message. When the MS includes the T3324 value IE and the MS indicates
support for extended periodic timer value in the MS network feature support IE, it may also include the T3312 extended
value IE to request a particular T3312 value to be allocated.

In A/Gb mode, if the MS supports the restriction on use of enhanced coverage, then the MS shall set the Restriction on
use of enhanced coverage capability bit to "Mobile station supports restriction of use of enhanced coverage" in the MS
network capability IE of the ATTACH REQUEST message.

If the MS supports dual connectivity of E-UTRA with New Radio (NR), then the MS shall set the Dual connectivity of
E-UTRA with NR capability bit to "Mobile station supports dual connectivity of E-UTRA with NR" in the MS network
capability IE of the ATTACH REQUEST message.

In A/Gb mode, if a UMTS security context is available and if the MS indicates support of integrity protection in the MS
network capability IE included in the ATTACH REQUEST message, then the MS shall derive a GPRS GSM Kint key
as described in subclause 4.7.7.3b and a GPRS GSM Kc128 key as described in subclause 4.7.7.3a. The MS shall then

assign the GPRS GSM Kint key, the GPRS GSM Kc128 key, the GPRS GSM integrity algorithm and the GPRS GSM
ciphering algorithm (identified by the information in the Ciphering Algorithm IE and Integrity Algorithm IE stored in
the non-volatile ME memory) to the LLC layer, and indicate to the LLC layer that it shall start integrity protection. This
shall be done so that the LLC layer can integrity protect, but not cipher, the ATTACH REQUEST message. The MS
shall include the CKSN in the CKSN IE in the ATTACH REQUEST message. If the MS has no UMTS security context
available, then the MS shall not integrity protect the ATTACH REQUEST message in the LLC layer. In this case the
MS shall set the CKSN IE to the value "no key is available" and send the ATTACH REQUEST unprotected.

4.7.3.1.2            GMM common procedure initiation
If the network receives an ATTACH REQUEST message containing the P-TMSI type IE and the Mobile identity IE
with type of identity indicating "TMSI/P-TMSI/M-TMSI", and the network does not follow the use of the most
significant bit of the LAC as specified in 3GPP TS 23.003 [10] subclause 2.8.2.2.2, the network shall use the P-TMSI
type IE to determine whether the mobile identity included in the Mobile identity IE is a native P-TMSI or a mapped
P-TMSI.

The network may initiate GMM common procedures, e.g. the GMM identification and GMM authentication and
ciphering procedure, depending on the received information such as IMSI, CKSN, old RAI, P-TMSI and P-TMSI
signature.

4.7.3.1.3            GPRS attach accepted by the network
During an attach for emergency bearer services, if not restricted by local regulations, the network shall not check for
mobility and access restrictions, regional restrictions, subscription restrictions, or perform CSG access control when
processing the ATTACH REQUEST message. The network shall not apply subscribed APN based congestion control
during an attach procedure for emergency bearer services.

If the GPRS attach request is accepted by the network, an ATTACH ACCEPT message is sent to the MS.

In A/Gb mode, if the MS indicates support of integrity protection in the MS network capability IE in the ATTACH
REQUEST message, and if the network supports integrity protection, then the network shall store all octets received
from the MS in the MS network capability IE and in the MS Radio Access Capability IE, up to the maximum length
defined for the respective information element.

   NOTE 1: The network needs to store the MS network capability IE and the MS Radio Access Capability IE exactly
           as received from the MS and network is not allowed to ignore the "higher" octets sent by the MS even if
           the network does not support any features indicated in the higher octets. Otherwise the replay check of the
           MS network capability and the MS Radio Access Capability will fail in the MS.

In A/Gb mode, if a UMTS security context is available in the network and if the MS indicates support of integrity
protection in the ATTACH REQUEST message and the network supports integrity protection, and if integrity
protection of the ATTACH REQUEST message is successfully verified in the LLC layer in the network, then if the
network decides to re-authenticate the MS or select a new integrity algorithm or ciphering algorithm, the network shall
initiate an authentication and ciphering procedure.

In A/Gb mode, if a UMTS security context is available in the network and if the MS indicates support of integrity
protection in the ATTACH REQUEST message and the network supports integrity protection if integrity protection of
the ATTACH REQUEST message is successfully verified in the LLC layer in the network , the network may decide to
continue using the stored: GPRS GSM Kint integrity key, the GPRS GSM Kc128 ciphering key, the GPRS GSM
ciphering algorithm and the GPRS GSM integrity algorithm in the LLC layer without initiating an authentication and
ciphering procedure. If the MS and network continue to use the same ciphering mode as when the MS was previously
attached to the network, ciphering or no ciphering, the ciphering mode is re-established without the need to run an
authentication and ciphering procedure. The network shall replay the MS network capability IE and the MS radio access
capability IE received from the MS in the ATTACH REQUEST message, by including the MS network capability IE
and the MS radio access capability IE in the ATTACH ACCEPT message to the MS. The GMM layer in the network
shall assign the stored GPRS GSM Kint key, the GPRS GSM Kc128 key, the GPRS GSM integrity algorithm and the
GPRS GSM ciphering algorithm to the LLC layer. The GMM layer in the network shall then indicate to the LLC layer
that it shall start integrity protection and ciphering in the LLC layer before sending the ATTACH ACCEPT message to
the MS. If the integrity protection of the ATTACH REQUEST message is not successfully verified in the LLC layer or
if the ATTACH REQUEST message is received without integrity protection, then the network shall progress the
ATTACH REQUEST message and initiate an authentication and ciphering procedure in order to authenticate the MS
and activate integrity protection and ciphering in the MS.

In A/Gb mode, if a UMTS security context is available in the network and if the MS indicates support of integrity
protection in the ATTACH REQUEST message and the network supports integrity protection, and if the network is not
able to verify the message authentication code in the LLC layer protecting the ATTACH REQUEST message, due to
the LLC layer at the network not having been configured yet with the integrity key and integrity algorithm for this MS,
then the network shall progress the ATTACH REQUEST message at GMM layer anyway. If the CKSN included in the
ATTACH REQUEST message belongs to an UMTS security context available in the network, then the network may re-
establish integrity protection and ciphering of layer 3 signalling messages in the LLC layer without initiating an
authentication and ciphering procedure.

In A/Gb mode, if the MS indicates support of integrity protection of user plane data in the MS network capability IE in
the ATTACH REQUEST message, and if the network supports and accepts integrity protection of user plane data, then
the network shall indicate integrity protection of user plane data to the MS in the ATTACH ACCEPT message. The MS
shall indicate to the LLC layer to start integrity protection of user plane data after the reception of the ATTACH
ACCEPT message. The same GPRS GSM Kint key and the same GPRS GSM integrity algorithm used for integrity
protection of layer 3 signalling messages shall be used for integrity protection of user plane data in the LLC layer. The
network shall indicate to the LLC layer to start integrity protection of user plane data after sending off the ATTACH
ACCEPT message to the MS. If the network does not indicate to the MS in the ATTACH ACCEPT message that it
accepts the use of integrity protection of user plane, and if the MS does not accept such a network, then the MS shall
detach from the network.

The P-TMSI reallocation may be part of the GPRS attach procedure. When the ATTACH REQUEST includes the IMSI
or IMEI, the SGSN shall allocate the P-TMSI. The P-TMSI that shall be allocated is then included in the ATTACH
ACCEPT message together with the routing area identifier. The network shall, in this case, change to state GMM-
COMMON-PROCEDURE-INITIATED and shall start timer T3350 as described in subclause 4.7.6. Furthermore, the
network may assign a P-TMSI signature for the GMM context which is then also included in the ATTACH ACCEPT
message. If the LAI or PLMN identity that has been transmitted in the ATTACH ACCEPT message is a member of any
of the "forbidden" lists, any such entry shall be deleted. If the attach procedure is for emergency bearer services, the
"forbidden" lists shall remain unchanged. Additionally, the network shall include the radio priority level to be used by
the MS for mobile originated SMS transfer in the ATTACH ACCEPT message.

In a shared network, if the MS is a network sharing supporting MS, the network shall indicate the PLMN identity of the
CN operator that has accepted the GPRS attach request in the RAI contained in the ATTACH ACCEPT message; if the
MS is a network sharing non-supporting MS, the network shall indicate the PLMN identity of the common PLMN (see
3GPP TS 23.251 [109]). If the PLMN identity of the common PLMN included in the RAI does not identify the CN
operator that has accepted the GPRS attach request, the network may include the PLMN identity of the CN operator that
has accepted the GPRS attach request in the ATTACH ACCEPT message.

In a multi-operator core network (MOCN) with common GERAN, the network shall indicate in the RAI the common
PLMN identity (see 3GPP TS 23.251 [109]).

If the common PLMN identity included in the RAI does not identify the CN operator that has accepted the GPRS attach
request, the network may include the PLMN identity of the CN operator that has accepted the GPRS attach request in
the ATTACH ACCEPT message.

If the MS has indicated in the ATTACH REQUEST message that it supports PS inter-RAT handover from GERAN to
UTRAN Iu mode, the network may include in the ATTACH ACCEPT message a request to provide the Inter RAT
information container.

If the MS has included the MS network capability IE or the UE network capability IE or both in the ATTACH
REQUEST message, the network shall store all octets received from the MS, up to the maximum length defined for the
respective information element.

   NOTE 2: This information is forwarded to the new SGSN during inter-SGSN handover or to the new MME during
           intersystem handover to S1 mode.

If the DRX parameter was included in the DRX Parameter IE in the ATTACH REQUEST message, the network shall
replace any stored DRX parameter with the received parameter and use it for the downlink transfer of signalling and
user data.

The network shall include the extended DRX parameters IE in the ATTACH ACCEPT message only if the extended
DRX parameters IE was included in the ATTACH REQUEST message, and the network supports and accepts the use
of eDRX.

In A/Gb mode, the Cell Notification information element shall be included in the ATTACH ACCEPT message by the
network which indicates that the Cell Notification is supported by the network.

In Iu mode, the network should prolong the PS signalling connection if the mobile station has indicated a follow-on
request pending in ATTACH REQUEST. The network may also prolong the PS signalling connection without any
indication from the mobile terminal.

The MS, receiving an ATTACH ACCEPT message, stores the received routing area identification, stops timer T3310,
resets the GPRS attach attempt counter, resets the routing area updating attempt counter, resets the service request
attempt counter, enters state GMM-REGISTERED and sets the GPRS update status to GU1 UPDATED.

If the message contains a P-TMSI, the MS shall use this P-TMSI as the new temporary identity for GPRS services. In
this case, an ATTACH COMPLETE message is returned to the network. The MS shall delete its old P-TMSI and shall
store the new one. If no P-TMSI has been included by the network in the ATTACH ACCEPT message, the old P-TMSI,
if any available, shall be kept.

If the message contains a P-TMSI signature, the MS shall use this P-TMSI signature as the new temporary signature for
the GMM context. The MS shall delete its old P-TMSI signature, if any is available, and shall store the new one. If the
message contains no P-TMSI signature, the old P-TMSI signature, if available, shall be deleted.

If the network supports delivery of SMS via GPRS (3GPP TS 23.060 [74]) and this delivery is enabled (see
3GPP TS 29.272 [150]), then the network shall include the Additional network feature support IE in the ATTACH
ACCEPT message and set the GPRS-SMS indicator.

If the network supports the extended protocol configuration options IE and the MS indicated support of the extended
protocol configuration options IE, then the network shall include the Additional network feature support IE in the
ATTACH ACCEPT message and set the ePCO IE indicator to "extended protocol configuration options IE supported".

Upon receiving the ATTACH ACCEPT message an MS supporting S1 mode shall set the TIN to "P-TMSI".

If the network has requested the provision of Inter RAT handover information, the MS shall return an ATTACH
COMPLETE message including the Inter RAT handover information IE to the network.

The network may also send a list of "equivalent PLMNs" in the ATTACH ACCEPT message. Each entry of the list
contains a PLMN code (MCC+MNC). The mobile station shall store the list, as provided by the network, and if the
GPRS attach procedure is not for emergency bearer services, any PLMN code that is already in the "forbidden PLMN"
list shall be removed from the "equivalent PLMNs" list before it is stored by the mobile station. If the mobile station is
operating in MS operation mode C or the mobile station is supporting S1 mode, it shall also remove any PLMN code
that is already in the list of "forbidden PLMNs for GPRS service" before storing the list. In addition the mobile station
shall add to the stored list the PLMN code of the registered PLMN that sent the list. All PLMNs in the stored list shall
be regarded as equivalent to each other for PLMN selection, cell selection/re-selection and handover. The stored list in
the mobile station shall be replaced on each occurrence of the ATTACH ACCEPT message. If no list is contained in the
message, then the stored list in the mobile station shall be deleted. An MS attached for emergency bearer services shall
delete the stored list when the MS enters the state GMM-DEREGISTERED. The list shall be stored in the mobile
station while switched off so that it can be used for PLMN selection after switch on.

The network shall include the T3324 value IE in the ATTACH ACCEPT message only if the T3324 value IE was
included in the ATTACH REQUEST message, and the network supports and accepts the use of PSM.

If the network supports and accepts the use of PSM, and the MS included the T3312 extended value IE in the ATTACH
REQUEST message, then the network shall take into account the T3312 value requested when providing the Periodic
RA update timer IE and the T3312 extended value IE in the ATTACH ACCEPT message.

   NOTE 3: Besides the value requested by the MS, the network can take local configuration into account when
           selecting a value for T3312 (see 3GPP TS 23.060 [74] subclause 5.3.13.54).

In A/Gb mode, if the MS indicates support for restriction on use of enhanced coverage in the ATTACH REQUEST
message, and the network restricts enhanced coverage for the MS, then the network shall set the RestrictEC bit to
"Enhanced coverage restricted" in the Additional network feature support IE of the ATTACH ACCEPT message.

In Iu mode, if the network wishes to prolong the PS signalling connection (for example, if the mobile station has
indicated "follow-on request pending" in ATTACH REQUEST message) the network shall indicate the "follow-on
proceed" in the ATTACH ACCEPT message. If the network wishes to release the PS signalling connection, the
network shall indicate "no follow-on proceed" in the ATTACH ACCEPT message.

After that in Iu mode, the mobile station shall act according to the follow-on proceed flag included in the Attach result
information element in the ATTACH ACCEPT message (see subclause 4.7.13).

In A/Gb mode, if the ATTACH ACCEPT message contains the Cell Notification information element, then the MS
shall start to use the LLC NULL frame to perform cell updates. The network receiving an ATTACH COMPLETE
message stops timer T3350, changes to GMM-REGISTERED state and considers the P-TMSI sent in the ATTACH
ACCEPT message as valid.

If the ATTACH ACCEPT message contains the T3312 extended value IE, then the MS shall use the value in T3312
extended value IE as periodic routing area update timer (T3312). If the ATTACH ACCEPT message does not contain
T3312 extended value IE, then the MS shall use the value in the Periodic RA update timer IE as periodic routing area
update timer (T3312).

If the ATTACH ACCEPT message contains the T3324 value IE, then the MS shall use the included timer value for
T3324 as specified in subclause 4.7.2.8.

If the ATTACH ACCEPT message contains the DCN-ID IE, then the MS shall store the included DCN-ID value
together with the PLMN code of the registered PLMN in a DCN-ID list in a non-volatile memory in the ME as
described in 3GPP TS 24.301 [120], annex C.

In a shared network or in a multi-operator core network (MOCN) with common GERAN, if the ATTACH ACCEPT
message contains the DCN-ID IE and the PLMN identity of the CN operator IE, the MS shall store the included DCN-
ID value with the PLMN identity indicated in the PLMN identity of the CN operator IE, and the included DCN-ID
value with the PLMN identity indicated in the RAI in a DCN-ID list in a non-volatile memory in the ME as described in
3GPP TS 24.301 [120], annex C.

If the MS receives the ATTACH ACCEPT message from a PLMN for which a PLMN-specific attempt counter or
PLMN-specific PS-attempt counter is maintained (see subclause 4.1.1.6A), then the MS shall reset these counters. If the
MS maintains a counter for "SIM/USIM considered invalid for GPRS services", then the MS shall reset this counter.

The network may also send a Local Emergency Numbers List with local emergency numbers in the ATTACH
ACCEPT, by including the Emergency Number List IE. The mobile equipment shall store the Local Emergency
Numbers List, as provided by the network. The Local Emergency Numbers List stored in the mobile equipment shall be
replaced on each receipt of the Emergency Number List IE. The received Local Emergency Numbers List shall be
provided to the upper layers.

The emergency number(s) received in the Emergency Number List IE are valid only in networks in the same country as
the cell on which this IE is received. If no list is contained in the ATTACH ACCEPT message, then the stored Local
Emergency Numbers List in the mobile equipment shall be kept, except if the mobile equipment has successfully
registered to a PLMN in a country different from that of the PLMN that sent the Local Emergency Numbers List.

The mobile equipment shall use the stored Local Emergency Numbers List of emergency numbers received from the
network in addition to the emergency numbers stored on the SIM/USIM or ME to detect that the number dialled is an
emergency number.

   NOTE 4: The mobile equipment may use the Local Emergency Numbers List to assist the end user in determining
           whether the dialled number is intended for an emergency service or for another destination, e.g. a local
           directory service. The possible interactions with the end user are implementation specific.

   NOTE 5: An MS that supports procedures specified in 3GPP TS 24.302 [156], can get additional local emergency
           numbers through those procedures, which can be used based on operator policy (see
           3GPP TS 24.302 [156]) to detect that the number dialled is an emergency number.

The Local Emergency Numbers List shall be deleted at switch off and removal of the SIM/USIM. The mobile
equipment shall be able to store up to ten local emergency numbers received from the network.

If the MS has initiated the attach procedure due to manual CSG selection and receives an ATTACH ACCEPT message,
and the MS sent the ATTACH REQUEST message in a CSG cell, the MS shall check if the CSG ID and associated
PLMN identity of the cell are contained in the Allowed CSG list. If not, the MS shall add that CSG ID and associated
PLMN identity to the Allowed CSG list and the MS may add the HNB Name (if provided by lower layers) to the
Allowed CSG list if the HNB Name is present in neither the Operator CSG list nor the Allowed CSG list.

In A/Gb mode, if a UMTS security context is available, if the MS indicates support of integrity protection in the
ATTACH REQUEST message and the network supports integrity protection, then if the MS receives replayed
capabilities IE’s in ATTACH ACCEPT, then the MS shall check if the replayed MS network capability IE and replayed

MS Radio Access Capability IE received in the ATTACH ACCEPT message has not been altered compared to the MS
network capability IE and the MS Radio Access Capability IE that the MS sent to the network in ATTACH REQUEST
message. If the replayed MS network capability IE and the replayed MS Radio Access Capability IE are not the same,
then the MS shall ignore the ATTACH ACCEPT message.

4.7.3.1.4            GPRS attach not accepted by the network
If the attach request cannot be accepted by the network, an ATTACH REJECT message is transferred to the MS. The
MS receiving the ATTACH REJECT message containing a reject cause other than GMM cause value #25 or the
message is integrity protected, shall stop the timer T3310 and for all causes except #12, #14, #15, #22 and #25 deletes
the list of "equivalent PLMNs".

If the ATTACH REJECT message containing GMM cause value cause #25 was received without integrity protection,
then the MS shall discard the message.

If the attach request is rejected due to NAS level mobility management congestion control, the network shall set the
GMM cause value to #22 "congestion" and assign a back-off timer T3346.

The MS shall then take one of the following actions depending upon the reject cause:

   #3      (Illegal MS);

   #6      (Illegal ME);

        The MS shall set the GPRS update status to GU3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED (and shall store it according to
        subclause 4.1.3.2) and shall delete any P-TMSI, P-TMSI signature, RAI and GPRS ciphering key sequence
        number. The new GMM state is GMM-DEREGISTERED. The SIM/USIM shall be considered as invalid for
        GPRS services until switching off or the SIM/USIM is removed or the timer T3245 expires as described in
        subclause 4.1.1.6. If the message has been successfully integrity checked by the lower layers and the MS
        maintains a counter for "SIM/USIM considered invalid for GPRS services", then the MS shall set this counter to
        MS implementation-specific maximum value.

        If the MS is IMSI attached, the MS shall in addition set the update status to U3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED,
        shall delete any TMSI, LAI and ciphering key sequence number. If the MS is operating in MS operation mode A
        and an RR connection exists, the MS shall abort the RR connection, unless an emergency call is ongoing. The
        SIM/USIM shall be considered as invalid also for non-GPRS services until switching off or the SIM/USIM is
        removed. If the message has been successfully integrity checked by the lower layers and the MS maintains a
        counter for "SIM/USIM considered invalid for non-GPRS services", then the MS shall set this counter to MS
        implementation-specific maximum value.

        If S1 mode is supported in the MS, the MS shall handle the EMM parameters EMM state, EPS update status,
        GUTI, last visited registered TAI, TAI list and KSI as specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 [120] for the case when the
        attach procedure is rejected with the EMM cause with the same value.

        The MS shall set the GPRS update status to GU3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED (and shall store it according to
        subclause 4.1.3.2) and shall delete any P-TMSI, P-TMSI signature, RAI and GPRS ciphering key sequence
        number. The SIM/USIM shall be considered as invalid for GPRS services until switching off or the SIM/USIM
        is removed. The new state is GMM-DEREGISTERED. If the message has been successfully integrity checked
        by the lower layers and the MS maintains a counter for "SIM/USIM considered invalid for GPRS services", then

   NOTE 3: The cell selection procedure is not applicable for an MS in GAN mode.

      If S1 mode is supported in the MS, the MS shall handle the EMM parameters EMM state, EPS update status,
      GUTI, last visited registered TAI, TAI list, KSI and attach attempt counter as specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 [120]
      for the case when the attach procedure is rejected with the EMM cause with the same value.

   # 13   (Roaming not allowed in this location area);

      The MS shall delete any RAI, P-TMSI, P-TMSI signature and GPRS ciphering key sequence number, shall set
      the GPRS update status to GU3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED (and shall store it according to clause 4.1.3.2) and
      shall reset the GPRS attach attempt counter. The state is changed to GMM-DEREGISTERED.LIMITED-
      SERVICE or optionally to GMM-DEREGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH.

      The MS shall store the LAI in the list of "forbidden location areas for roaming".

      The MS shall start timer T3340 as described in subclause 4.7.1.9.

      If no RR connection exists, the MS shall perform the following additional actions immediately. If the MS is
      operating in MS operation mode A and an RR connection exists, the MS shall perform these actions when the
      RR connection is subsequently released:

      -   If the MS is IMSI attached, the MS shall set the update status to U3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED, shall
          delete any TMSI, LAI and ciphering key sequence number and shall reset the location update attempt
          counter. The new MM state is MM IDLE.

      -   The MS shall perform a PLMN selection according to 3GPP TS 23.122 [14].

          An MS in GAN mode shall request a PLMN list in GAN (see 3GPP TS 44.318 [76b]) prior to perform a
          PLMN selection from this list according to 3GPP TS 23.122 [14].

      If S1 mode is supported in the MS, the MS shall handle the EMM parameters EMM state, EPS update status,
      GUTI, last visited registered TAI, TAI list, KSI and attach attempt counter as specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 [120]
      for the case when the attach procedure is rejected with the EMM cause with the same value.

   # 14   (GPRS services not allowed in this PLMN);

      The MS shall delete any RAI, P-TMSI, P-TMSI signature, and GPRS ciphering key sequence number stored,
      shall set the GPRS update status to GU3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED (and shall store it according to
      subclause 4.1.3.2) , shall reset the GPRS attach attempt counter and shall change to state GMM-
      DEREGISTERED.

      The MS shall store the PLMN identity in the "forbidden PLMNs for GPRS service" list and if the MS is
      configured to use timer T3245 (see 3GPP TS 24.368 [135] or 3GPP TS 31.102 [112]) then the MS shall start
      timer T3245 and proceed as described in subclause 4.1.1.6. A GPRS MS operating in MS operation mode C
      shall perform a PLMN selection instead of a cell selection. If the message has been successfully integrity
      checked by the lower layers and the MS maintains a PLMN-specific PS-attempt counter for that PLMN, then the
      MS shall set this counter to the MS implementation-specific maximum value.

      A GPRS MS operating in MS operation mode A or B in network operation mode II, is still IMSI attached for CS
      services in the network.

      As an implementation option, a GPRS MS operating in operation mode A or B may perform the following
      additional action. If no RR connection exists the MS may perform the action immediately. If the MS is operating
      in MS operation mode A and an RR connection exists, the MS may only perform the action when the RR
      connection is subsequently released:

      -   The MS may perform a PLMN selection according to 3GPP TS 23.122 [14].

      If an MS in GAN mode performs a PLMN selection, it shall request a PLMN list in GAN (see
      3GPP TS 44.318 [76b]) prior to perform a PLMN selection from this list according to 3GPP TS 23.122 [14].

      the GPRS update status to GU3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED(and shall store it according to clause 4.1.3.2) and
      shall reset the GPRS attach attempt counter. The state is changed to GMM-DEREGISTERED.LIMITED-
      SERVICE.

      The MS shall store the LAI in the list of "forbidden location areas for roaming".

      The MS shall start timer T3340 as described in subclause 4.7.1.9.

      If no RR connection exists, the MS shall perform the following additional actions immediately. If the MS is
      operating in MS operation mode A and an RR connection exists, the MS shall perform these actions when the
      RR connection is subsequently released:

      -   If the MS is IMSI attached, the MS shall set the update status to U3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED, shall
          delete any TMSI, LAI and ciphering key sequence number and shall reset the location update attempt
          counter. The new MM state is MM IDLE.

      -   The MS shall search for a suitable cell in another location area or a tracking area according to
          3GPP TS 43.022 [82] and 3GPP TS 25.304 [98] or 3GPP TS 36.304 [121].

   NOTE 4: The cell selection procedure is not applicable for an MS in GAN mode.

      neither zero nor deactivated, the MS shall proceed as described below, otherwise it shall be considered as an
      abnormal case and the behaviour of the MS for this case is specified in subclause 4.7.3.1.5.

      The MS shall abort the attach procedure, reset the GPRS attach attempt counter, set the GPRS update status to
      GU2 NOT UPDATED and enter state GMM-DEREGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-ATTACH.

      The MS shall stop timer T3346 if it is running.

      If the ATTACH REJECT message is integrity protected, the MS shall start timer T3346 with the value provided

      If the ATTACH REJECT message is not integrity protected, the MS shall start timer T3346 with a random value
      from the default range specified in table 11.3a.

      The MS stays in the current serving cell and applies the normal cell reselection process. The attach procedure is
      started if still needed when timer T3346 expires or is stopped.

4.7.3.1.5           Abnormal cases in the MS
The following abnormal cases can be identified:

   a) Access barred because of access class control, EAB or ACDC

      The GPRS attach procedure shall not be started. The MS stays in the current serving cell and applies normal cell
      reselection process. The GPRS attach procedure is started as soon as possible, i.e. when access is granted or
      because of a cell change.

      If access is barred because of access class control, ACDC is applicable to the request from the upper layers and
      the MS supports ACDC, then the GPRS attach procedure shall be started.

      If access is barred for a certain ACDC category, a request with a higher ACDC category is received from the
      upper layers and the MS supports ACDC, then the GPRS attach procedure shall be started.

      If an access request for an uncategorized application is barred due to ACDC, a request with a certain ACDC
      category is received from the upper layers and the MS supports ACDC, then the GPRS attach procedure shall be
      started.

   b) Lower layer failure without "Extended Wait Time" received from lower layers before the ATTACH ACCEPT or
      ATTACH REJECT message is received

      The procedure shall be aborted and the MS shall proceed as described below, except in the following
      implementation option cases b.1 and b.2.

   b.1)   Release of PS signalling connection in Iu mode before the completion of the GPRS attach procedure

      If the release of the PS signalling connection occurs before completion of the GPRS attach procedure, then the
      GPRS attach procedure shall be initiated again, if the following conditions apply:

          i) The original GPRS attach procedure was initiated over an existing PS signalling connection; and

          ii) The GPRS attach procedure was not due to timer T3310 expiry; and

          iii) No SECURITY MODE COMMAND message and no Non-Access Startum (NAS) messages relating to
          the PS signalling connection (e.g. PS authentication procedure, see subclause 4.7.7) were received after the
          ATTACH REQUEST message was transmitted.

   b.2) RR release in Iu mode (i.e. RRC connection release) with, for example, cause "Normal", or "User inactivity"
       (see 3GPP TS 25.331 [23c] and 3GPP TS 44.118 [111])

      The GPRS attach procedure shall be initiated again, if the following conditions apply:

          i) The original GPRS attach procedure was initiated over an existing RRC connection; and

          ii) The GPRS attach procedure was not due to timer T3310 expiry; and

          iii) No SECURITY MODE COMMAND message and no Non-Access Stratum (NAS) messages relating to
          the PS signalling connection (e.g. PS authentication procedure, see subclause 4.7.7) were received after the
          ATTACH REQUEST message was transmitted.

   NOTE 1: The RRC connection release cause that triggers the re-initiation of the GPRS attach procedure is
           implementation specific.

   c) T3310 time-out

      On the first expiry of the timer, the MS shall reset and restart timer T3310 and shall retransmit the ATTACH
      REQUEST message. This retransmission is repeated four times, i.e. on the fifth expiry of timer T3310, the MS
      shall abort the GPRS attach procedure and, in Iu mode, release the PS signalling connection (see
      3GPP TS 25.331 [23c]). The MS shall proceed as described below.

   d) ATTACH REJECT, other causes than those treated in subclause 4.7.3.1.4, and cases of GMM cause values #22
      and #25, if considered as abnormal cases according to subclause 4.7.3.1.4

      If the attach request is neither for emergency bearer services nor for initiating a PDN connection for emergency
      bearer services with attach type not set to "emergency attach", upon reception of the cause codes # 95, # 96, #
      97, # 99 and # 111 the MS should set the GPRS attach attempt counter to 5.

      The MS shall proceed as described below.

   e) Change of cell within the same RA (A/Gb mode only)

      If a cell change occurs within the same RA when the MS is in state GMM-REGISTERED-INITIATED, then the
      cell update procedure shall be performed before completion of the attach procedure.

   f) Change of cell into a new routing area

      If a cell change into a new routing area occurs before an ATTACH ACCEPT or ATTACH REJECT message has
      been received, the GPRS attach procedure shall be aborted and re-initiated immediately. If a routing area border
      is crossed when the ATTACH ACCEPT message is received but before an ATTACH COMPLETE message is
      sent, the GPRS attach procedure shall be aborted and the routing area updating procedure shall be initiated. If a
      P-TMSI was allocated during the GPRS attach procedure, this P-TMSI shall be used in the routing area updating
      procedure. If a P-TMSI signature was allocated together with the P-TMSI during the GPRS attach procedure,
      this P-TMSI signature shall be used in the routing area updating procedure.

   g) Mobile originated detach required

      If the MS is in state GMM-REGISTERED-INITIATED, the GPRS attach procedure shall be aborted and the
      GPRS detach procedure shall be performed (see subclause 4.7.4.1).

   h) Detach procedure collision

      If the MS receives a DETACH REQUEST message from the network in state GMM-REGISTERED-
      INITIATED with detach type "re-attach not required" and no cause code, or "re-attach not required"' and the
      cause code is not #2 "IMSI unknown in HLR", the GPRS detach procedure shall be progressed and the GPRS
      attach procedure shall be aborted. Otherwise the GPRS attach procedure shall be progressed and the DETACH
      REQUEST message shall be ignored.

   i) "Extended wait time" for PS domain from the lower layers

      If the ATTACH REQUEST message contained the low priority indicator set to "MS is configured for NAS
      signalling low priority", the MS shall start timer T3346 with the "Extended wait time" value and reset the attach
      attempt counter.

      In other cases the MS shall ignore the "Extended wait time".

      The MS shall abort the attach procedure, stay in the current serving cell, change the state to GMM-
      DEREGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-ATTACH and apply the normal cell reselection process.

   j) Timer T3346 is running

      The MS shall not start the GPRS attach procedure unless the MS needs to attach for emergency bearer services
      or the MS is an MS configured to use AC11 – 15 in selected PLMN or the MS needs to attach without the NAS
      signalling low priority indication and if the timer T3346 was started due to rejection of a NAS request message
      (e.g. ATTACH REQUEST, ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST or SERVICE REQUEST) which contained
      the low priority indicator set to "MS is configured for NAS signalling low priority". The MS stays in the current
      serving cell and applies normal cell reselection process.

   NOTE 2: It is considered an abnormal case if the MS needs to initiate an attach procedure while timer T3346 is
           running independent on whether timer T3346 was started due to an abnormal case or a non successful
           case.

In cases b, c, d, i and j, the MS shall proceed as follows:

   -   Timer T3310 shall be stopped if still running.

   -   For the cases b, c, d, and i when the "Extended wait time" is ignored, if the attach request is neither for
       emergency bearer services nor for initiating a PDN connection for emergency bearer services with attach type
       not set to "emergency attach", the GPRS attach attempt counter shall be incremented.

   -   If the GPRS attach attempt counter is less than 5:

       -   for the cases i and j, the GPRS attach procedure is started, if still necessary, when timer T3346 expires or is
           stopped.

       -   for the cases b, c, d, and i when the "Extended wait time" is ignored, if the attach request is neither for
           emergency bearer services nor for initiating a PDN connection for emergency bearer services with attach
           type not set to "emergency attach", timer T3311 is started and the state is changed to GMM-
           DEREGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-ATTACH.

   -   If the GPRS attach attempt counter is greater than or equal to 5:

       -   the MS shall delete any RAI, P-TMSI, P-TMSI signature, list of equivalent PLMNs, and GPRS ciphering key

           state is changed to GMM-DEREGISTERED. ATTEMPTING-TO-ATTACH or optionally to GMM-
           DEREGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH (see subclause 4.2.4.1.2) in order to perform a PLMN selection
           according to 3GPP TS 23.122 [14].

           update status, GUTI, last visited registered TAI, TAI list and KSI as specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 [120] for
           the abnormal case when a normal attach procedure fails and the attach attempt counter is equal to 5.

4.7.3.1.6              Abnormal cases on the network side
   The following abnormal cases can be identified:

   a) Lower layer failure

       If a low layer failure occurs before the message ATTACH COMPLETE has been received from the MS and a
       new P-TMSI (or a new P-TMSI and a new P-TMSI signature) has been assigned, the network shall consider both
       the old and new P-TMSI each with its corresponding P-TMSI-signature as valid until the old P-TMSI can be
       considered as invalid by the network (see subclause 4.7.1.5) or the GMM context which has been marked as
       detached in the network is released, and shall not resent the message ATTACH ACCEPT. During this period the
       network may:

       -   use the identification procedure followed by a P-TMSI reallocation procedure if the old P-TMSI is used by
           the MS in a subsequent message.

   b) Protocol error

       If the ATTACH REQUEST message is received with a protocol error, the network shall return an ATTACH
       REJECT message with one of the following reject causes:

       #96:   Mandatory information element error;

       #99:   Information element non-existent or not implemented;

       #100: Conditional IE error;

       #111: Protocol error, unspecified.

   c) T3350 time-out

       On the first expiry of the timer, the network shall retransmit the ATTACH ACCEPT message and shall reset and
       restart timer T3350.

       This retransmission is repeated four times, i.e. on the fifth expiry of timer T3350, the GPRS attach procedure
       shall be aborted. If a new P-TMSI or a new P-TMSI together with a new P-TMSI signature were allocated in the

       ATTACH ACCEPT message, the network shall consider both the old and new P-TMSI each together with the
       corresponding P-TMSI signatures as valid until the old P-TMSI can be considered as invalid by the network (see
       subclause 4.7.1.5) or the GMM context which has been marked as detached in the network is released. During
       this period the network acts as specified for case a.

   d.1) ATTACH REQUEST received after the ATTACH ACCEPT message has been sent and before the ATTACH
       COMPLETE message is received

   -   If one or more of the information elements in the ATTACH REQUEST message differ from the ones received
       within the previous ATTACH REQUEST message, the previously initiated GPRS attach procedure shall be
       aborted if the ATTACH COMPLETE message has not been received and the new GPRS attach procedure shall
       be progressed, or

   -   If the information elements do not differ, then the ATTACH ACCEPT message shall be resent and the timer
       T3350 shall be restarted if an ATTACH COMPLETE message is expected. In that case, the retransmission
       counter related to T3350 is not incremented.

   d.2) More than one ATTACH REQUEST received and no ATTACH ACCEPT or ATTACH REJECT message
       has been sent

   -   If one or more of the information elements in the ATTACH REQUEST message differs from the ones received
       within the previous ATTACH REQUEST message, the previously initiated GPRS attach procedure shall be
       aborted and the new GPRS attach procedure shall be progressed;

   -   If the information elements do not differ, then the network shall continue with the previous attach procedure and
       shall not treat any further this ATTACH REQUEST message.

   e) ATTACH REQUEST received in state GMM-REGISTERED

       If an ATTACH REQUEST message is received in state GMM-REGISTERED the network may initiate the
       GMM common procedures; if it turned out that the ATTACH REQUEST message was send by an MS that has
       already been attached, the GMM context, PDP contexts and MBMS contexts, if any, are deleted and the new
       ATTACH REQUEST is progressed.

   f) ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message received before ATTACH COMPLETE message.

       Timer T3350 shall be stopped. The allocated P-TMSI shall be considered as valid and the routing area updating
       procedure shall be progressed as described in subclause 4.7.5.

   g) DETACH REQUEST message received before ATTACH COMPLETE message.

       The network shall abort the attach procedure and shall progress the detach procedure as described in
       subclause 4.7.4.1.

    Figure 4.7.3/1 3GPP TS 24.008: GPRS attach procedure and combined GPRS attach procedure


4.7.3.2          Combined GPRS attach procedure for GPRS and non-GPRS services
The combined GPRS attach procedure is a GMM procedure used by a GPRS MS operating in MS operation modes A or
B for IMSI attach for GPRS and non-GPRS services if the network operates in network operation mode I.

If a GPRS MS operating in MS operation modes A or B is already attached for non-GPRS services by use of the MM
specific IMSI attach procedure, but additionally wishes to perform an IMSI attach for GPRS services, the combined
GPRS attach procedure shall also be used.

The attach type information element shall indicate "combined GPRS/IMSI attach". In this case, the messages ATTACH
ACCEPT, ATTACH COMPLETE, and ATTACH REJECT used by the combined GPRS attach procedure carry
information for both the GPRS and the non-GPRS services.

A GPRS MS in MS operation mode A shall perform the normal GPRS/IMSI attach procedure during an ongoing
circuit-switched transaction.

4.7.3.2.1            Combined GPRS attach procedure initiation
If the MS is in GMM state GMM-DEREGISTERED and in MM state MM IDLE, the MS initiates the combined GPRS
attach procedure by sending an ATTACH REQUEST message to the network, starts timer T3310 and enters state
GMM-REGISTERED-INITIATED and MM LOCATION UPDATING PENDING. If timer T3302 is currently running,
the MS shall stop timer T3302. If timer T3311 is currently running, the MS shall stop timer T3311.

The MS shall set the Mobile identity IE, old RAI and P-TMSI signature in the ATTACH REQUEST message as
specified in subclause 4.7.3.1.1. Furthermore the MS shall include the TMSI status IE if no valid TMSI is available.

If the MS initiates a combined GPRS attach procedure for GPRS services and "SMS-only service", the MS shall
indicate "SMS only" in the Additional update type IE.

If the MS has stored a valid LAI and the MS supports EMM combined procedures, the MS shall include it in the Old
location area identification IE in the ATTACH REQUEST message.

If the MS has stored a valid TMSI, the MS shall include the TMSI based NRI container IE in the ATTACH REQUEST
message.

In Iu mode, if the MS wishes to prolong the established PS signalling connection after the GPRS attach (for example,
the MS has any CM application request pending), it may set a follow-on request pending indicator on (see
subclause 4.7.13).

4.7.3.2.2            GMM Common procedure initiation
The network may initiate GMM common procedures, e.g. the GMM identification and GMM authentication and
ciphering procedure, depending on the received information such as IMSI, CKSN, old RAI, P-TMSI and P-TMSI
signature.

4.7.3.2.3            Combined GPRS attach accepted by the network
Depending on the value of the attach result IE received in the ATTACH ACCEPT message, two different cases can be
distinguished:

   Case 1)    The attach result IE value indicates "combined GPRS attach": IMSI attach for GPRS and non-GPRS
              services have been successful.

   Case 2)    The attach result IE value indicates "GPRS only": IMSI attach for GPRS services has been successful but
              IMSI attach for non-GPRS services has not been successful.

In Iu mode, if the network wishes to prolong the PS signalling connection (for example, if the mobile station has
indicated "follow-on request pending" in ATTACH REQUEST message) the network shall indicate the "follow-on
proceed" in the ATTACH ACCEPT message. If the network wishes to release the PS signalling connection, the
network shall indicate "no follow-on proceed" in the ATTACH ACCEPT message.

After that in Iu mode, the mobile station shall act according to the follow-on proceed flag included in the Attach result
information element in the ATTACH ACCEPT message (see subclause 4.7.13).



4.7.3.2.3.1              Combined attach successful for GPRS and non-GPRS services

The description for IMSI attach for GPRS services as specified in subclause 4.7.3.1.3 shall be followed. In addition, the
following description for IMSI attach for non-GPRS services applies.

The TMSI reallocation may be part of the combined GPRS attach procedure. The TMSI allocated is then included in the
ATTACH ACCEPT message together with the location area identification (LAI). The network shall, in this case,
change to state GMM-COMMON-PROCEDURE-INITIATED and shall start timer T3350 as described in
subclause 4.7.6.

The MS, receiving an ATTACH ACCEPT message, stores the received location area identification, stops timer T3310,
reset the location update attempt counter and sets the update status to U1 UPDATED. If the message contains an IMSI,
the mobile station is not allocated any TMSI, and shall delete any TMSI accordingly. If the message contains a TMSI,
the MS shall use this TMSI as the new temporary identity. The MS shall delete its old TMSI and shall store the new
TMSI. In this case, an ATTACH COMPLETE message is returned to the network. If neither a TMSI nor an IMSI has
been included by the network in the ATTACH ACCEPT message, the old TMSI, if any available, shall be kept. The
new MM state is MM IDLE, the new GMM state is GMM-REGISTERED.

If the MS maintains a counter for "SIM/USIM considered invalid for non-GPRS services" events (see
subclause 4.1.1.6A), then the MS shall reset this counter.

If the network has requested the provision of Inter RAT handover information, the MS shall return an ATTACH
COMPLETE message including the Inter RAT handover information IE to the network.

If the MS is not configured for NAS signalling low priority then the MS may stop timer T3246 if running.

Any timer used for triggering the location update procedure (e.g T3211, T3212) shall be stopped if running.

The network receiving an ATTACH COMPLETE message stops timer T3350, changes to state GMM-REGISTERED.

   NOTE:      Upon receiving an ATTACH COMPLETE message, the SGSN sends a BSSAP+-TMSI-
              REALLOCATION-COMPLETE message as specified in 3GPP TS 29.018 [149].

4.7.3.2.3.2              Combined attach successful for GPRS services only

Apart from the actions on the routing area updating attempt counter, the description for IMSI attach for GPRS services
as specified in subclause 4.7.3.1.3 shall be followed. In addition, the following description for IMSI attach for non-
GPRS services applies.

The SGSN shall use GMM cause #28 "SMS provided via GPRS in this routing area" in the ATTACH ACCEPT
message only if the MS requested "SMS-only service" by including the Additional update type IE in the ATTACH
REQUEST message.

The MS receiving the ATTACH ACCEPT message takes one of the following actions depending on the GMM cause:

   #2     (IMSI unknown in HLR)

          The MS shall stop timer T3310 if still running and shall reset the routing area updating attempt counter. The
          MS shall set the update status to U3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED and shall delete any TMSI, LAI and
          ciphering key sequence number. The MS shall enter state GMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE. The
          new MM state is MM IDLE. The SIM/USIM shall be considered as invalid for non-GPRS services until
          switching off or the SIM/USIM is removed. If the message has been successfully integrity checked by the
          lower layers and the MS maintains a counter for "SIM/USIM considered invalid for non-GPRS services",
          then the MS shall set this counter to MS implementation-specific maximum value.

   # 16   (MSC temporarily not reachable); or

   # 17   (Network failure)

          The MS shall stop timer T3310 if still running, and shall enter state MM-IDLE. The routing area updating
          attempt counter shall be incremented.

          If the routing area updating attempt counter is less than 5, and the stored RAI is equal to the RAI of the
          current serving cell and the GMM update status is equal to GU1 UPDATED:

          -   the MS shall keep the GMM update status GU1 UPDATED and changes state to GMM-
              REGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-UPDATE-MM. The MS shall start timer T3311. When timer T3311
              expires the combined routing area update procedure indicating "combined RA/LA updating with IMSI
              attach" is triggered again.

          If the routing area updating attempt counter is greater than or equal to 5:

          -   the MS shall start timer T3302 and shall change to state GMM-REGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-
              UPDATE-MM;

          -   a GPRS MS operating in MS operation mode A shall then proceed with appropriate MM specific
              procedure; a GPRS MS operating in MS operation mode B may then proceed with appropriate MM
              specific procedures. The MM sublayer shall act as in network operation mode II as long as the combined
              GMM procedures are not successful and no new RA is entered.

   # 22   (Congestion)

          The MS shall change to state GMM-REGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-UPDATE-MM, shall stop
          timer T3310 if still running, and shall enter state MM-IDLE. The MS shall set the routing area updating
          attempt counter to 5 and shall start the timer T3302.



   # 28   (SMS provided via GPRS in this routing area);

          The MS shall stop timer T3310 if still running and shall reset the routing area updating attempt counter. The
          MS shall set the update status to U3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED and shall delete any TMSI, LAI and
          ciphering key sequence number. The MS shall enter state GMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE. The
          new MM state is MM IDLE.

          The MS stays in the current serving cell and applies the normal cell reselection process.

Other GMM causevalues and the case that no GMM cause IE was received are considered as abnormal cases. The
combined attach procedure shall be considered as failed for non-GPRS services. The behaviour of the MS in those cases
is specified in subclause 4.7.3.2.5.

4.7.3.2.4             Combined GPRS attach not accepted by the network
If the attach request can neither be accepted by the network for GPRS nor for non-GPRS services, an ATTACH
REJECT message is transferred to the MS. The MS receiving the ATTACH REJECT message containing a reject cause
other than GMM cause value #25 or the message is integrity protected, shall stop the timer T3310, and for all causes
except #12, #14, #15, #22 and #25 deletes the list of "equivalent PLMNs".

If the ATTACH REJECT message containing GMM cause value #25 was received without integrity protection, then the
MS shall discard the message.

If the attach request is rejected due to NAS level mobility management congestion control, the network shall set the
GMM cause value to #22 "congestion" and assign a back-off timer T3346.

The MS shall then take one of the following actions depending upon the reject cause:

   #3      (Illegal MS);

   #6      (Illegal ME), or

   #8      (GPRS services and non-GPRS services not allowed);

        The MS shall set the GPRS update status to GU3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED (shall store it according to
        subclause 4.1.3.2) and shall delete any P-TMSI, P-TMSI signature, RAI and GPRS ciphering key sequence
        number. The new GMM state is GMM-DEREGISTERED. The new MM state is MM IDLE.

        The MS shall set the update status to U3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED, shall delete any TMSI, LAI and
        ciphering key sequence number. The SIM/USIM shall be considered as invalid for GPRS and non-GPRS
        services until switching off or the SIM/USIM is removed or the timer T3245 expires as described in
        subclause 4.1.1.6.

        If the message has been successfully integrity checked by the lower layers and the MS maintains a counter for
        "SIM/USIM considered invalid for GPRS services", then the MS shall set this counter to MS implementation-
        specific maximum value. If the message has been successfully integrity checked by the lower layers and the MS
        maintains a counter for "SIM/USIM considered invalid for non-GPRS services", then the MS shall set this
        counter to MS implementation-specific maximum value.

   NOTE 1: Optionally the MS starts the timer T3340 as described in subclause 4.7.1.9 for reject cause #8

        If S1 mode is supported in the MS, the MS shall handle the EMM parameters EMM state, EPS update status,
        GUTI, last visited registered TAI, TAI list and KSI as specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 [120] for the case when the
        combined attach procedure is rejected with the EMM cause with the same value.

   #7      (GPRS services not allowed);

        The MS shall set the GPRS update status to GU3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED (and shall store it according to
        subclause 4.1.3.2) and shall delete any P-TMSI, P-TMSI signature, RAI and GPRS ciphering key sequence
        number. The SIM/USIM shall be considered as invalid for GPRS services until switching off or the SIM/USIM
        is removed. The new GMM state is GMM-DEREGISTERED; the MM state is MM IDLE.

        If the message has been successfully integrity checked by the lower layers and the MS maintains a counter for
        "SIM/USIM considered invalid for GPRS services", then the MS shall set this counter to MS implementation-

      The MS shall perform a PLMN selection according to 3GPP TS 23.122 [14].

      An MS in GAN mode shall request a PLMN list in GAN (see 3GPP TS 44.318 [76b]) prior to perform a PLMN
      selection from this list according to 3GPP TS 23.122 [14].

      If S1 mode is supported in the MS, the MS shall handle the EMM parameters EMM state, EPS update status,

      for the case when the combined attach procedure is rejected with the EMM cause with the same value.

   # 14   (GPRS services not allowed in this PLMN);

      The MS shall delete any RAI, P-TMSI, P-TMSI signature, and GPRS ciphering key sequence number stored,
      shall set the GPRS update status to GU3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED (and shall store it according to
      subclause 4.1.3.2), shall reset the GPRS attach attempt counter and shall change to state GMM-
      DEREGISTERED.

      The MS shall store the PLMN identity in the "forbidden PLMNs for GPRS service" list and if the MS is
      configured to use timer T3245 (see 3GPP TS 24.368 [135] or 3GPP TS 31.102 [112]) then the MS shall start
      timer T3245 and proceed as described in subclause 4.1.1.6. If the message has been successfully integrity
      checked by the lower layers and the MS maintains a PLMN-specific PS-attempt counter for that PLMN, then the
      MS shall set this counter to the MS implementation-specific maximum value.

      As an implementation option, a GPRS MS operating in operation mode A or B may perform a PLMN selection
      according to 3GPP TS 23.122 [14].

      If an MS in GAN mode performs a PLMN selection, it shall request a PLMN list in GAN (see
      3GPP TS 44.318 [76b]) prior to perform a PLMN selection from this list according to 3GPP TS 23.122 [14].

      The MS shall not perform the optional PLMN selection in the case where the PLMN providing this reject cause
      is:

      -   On the "User Controlled PLMN Selector with Access Technology";

      -   On the "Operator Controlled PLMN Selector with Access Technology" list;

      -   On the "PLMN Selector" list for an MS using a SIM/USIM without access technology information storage
          (i.e. the "User Controlled PLMN Selector with Access Technology" and the "Operator Controlled PLMN
          Selector with Access Technology" data files are not present); or

      -   A PLMN identified as equivalent to any PLMN, within the same country, contained in the lists above.

      If the MS does not perform a PLMN selection then a GPRS MS operating in MS operation mode A or B which
      is not yet IMSI attached for CS services in the network shall then perform an IMSI attach for non-GPRS services
      according to the conditions for the MM IMSI attach procedure (see subclause 4.4.3).

      A GPRS MS operating in MS operation mode A or B which is already IMSI attached for CS services in the
      network is still IMSI attached for CS services in the network.

      A GPRS MS operating in MS operation mode A or B shall proceed with the appropriate MM specific procedure
      according to the MM service state.

      If S1 mode is supported in the MS, the MS shall handle the EMM parameters EMM state, EPS update status,
      GUTI, last visited registered TAI, TAI list, KSI and attach attempt counter as specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 [120]
      for the case when the combined attach procedure is rejected with the EMM cause with the same value.

      The MS shall start timer T3340 as described in subclause 4.7.1.9.

      The MS shall search for a suitable cell in another location area or a tracking area according to
      3GPP TS 43.022 [82] and 3GPP TS 25.304 [98] or 3GPP TS 36.304 [121].

      for the case when the combined attach procedure is rejected with the EMM cause with the same value.

   # 22   (Congestion);

      If the T3346 value IE is present in the ATTACH REJECT message and the value indicates that this timer is
      neither zero nor deactivated, the MS shall proceed as described below, otherwise it shall be considered as an
      abnormal case and the behaviour of the MS for this case is specified in subclause 4.7.3.1.5.

      The MS shall abort the attach procedure, reset the GPRS attach attempt counter, set the GPRS update status to

      The MS shall stop timer T3346 if it is running.

      If the ATTACH REJECT message is integrity protected, the MS shall start timer T3346 with the value provided
      in the T3346 value IE.

      If the ATTACH REJECT message is not integrity protected, the MS shall start timer T3346 with a random value
      from the default range specified in table 11.3a.

      The MS stays in the current serving cell and applies the normal cell reselection process. The attach procedure is
      started, if still necessary, when timer T3346 expires or is stopped.

      A GPRS MS operating in MS operation mode A or B which is already IMSI attached for CS services in the

      with the EMM cause with the same value.

   # 25   (Not authorized for this CSG)

      Cause #25 is only applicable in UTRAN Iu mode and when received from a CSG cell. Other cases are
      considered as abnormal cases and the specification of the mobile station behaviour is given in
      subclause 4.7.3.2.5.

      The MS shall set the GPRS update status to GU3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED (and shall store it according to

      If the CSG ID and associated PLMN identity of the cell where the MS has sent the ATTACH REQUEST
      message are contained in the Allowed CSG list stored in the MS, the MS shall remove the entry corresponding to
      this CSG ID and associated PLMN identity from the Allowed CSG list.

      If the CSG ID and associated PLMN identity of the cell where the MS has sent the ATTACH REQUEST

Other values are considered as abnormal cases. The specification of the MS behaviour in those cases is specified in
subclause 4.7.3.2.5.

4.7.3.2.5            Abnormal cases in the MS
The MS shall proceed as follows:

   1) If the combined attach was successful for GPRS services only and the ATTACH ACCEPT message contained a
      cause value not treated in subclause 4.7.3.2.3.2 or the GMM Cause IE is not included in the message, the MS
      shall proceed as follows:

       a) The MS shall stop timer T3310 if still running, and shall enter state MM IDLE. The routing area updating
          attempt counter shall be incremented;

       b) If the routing area updating attempt counter is less than 5, and the stored RAI is equal to the RAI of the
          current serving cell and the GMM update status is equal to GU1 UPDATED:

          -   the MS shall keep the GMM update status GU1 UPDATED and changes state to GMM-
              REGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-UPDATE-MM. The MS shall start timer T3311. When timer T3311
              expires the combined routing area update procedure indicating "combined RA/LA updating with IMSI
              attach" is triggered again; and

       c) If the routing area updating attempt counter is greater than or equal to 5:

          -   the MS shall start timer T3302 and shall change to state GMM-REGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-
              UPDATE-MM; and

          -   a GPRS MS operating in MS operation mode A shall then proceed with appropriate MM specific
              procedure; a GPRS MS operating in MS operation mode B may then proceed with appropriate MM
              specific procedures. The MM sublayer shall act as in network operation mode II as long as the combined
              GMM procedures are not successful and no new RA is entered; and

   2) Otherwise, the abnormal cases specified in subclause 4.7.3.1.5 apply with the following modification.

If the GPRS attach attempt counter is incremented according to subclause 4.7.3.1.5 the next actions depend on the
Location Area Identities (stored on SIM/USIM and the one of the current serving cell) and the value of the attach
attempt counter:

   -   if the update status is U1 UPDATED, and the stored LAI is equal to the one of the current serving cell and the
       attach attempt counter is smaller than 5, then the mobile station shall keep the update status to U1 UPDATED,
       the new MM state is MM IDLE substate NORMAL SERVICE;

   -   if the attach attempt counter is smaller than 5 and, additionally, the update status is different from U1
       UPDATED or the stored LAI is different from the one of the current serving cell, then the mobile station shall
       delete any LAI, TMSI, ciphering key sequence number stored in the SIM/USIM and list of equivalent PLMNs
       and set the update status to U2 NOT UPDATED. The MM state remains MM LOCATION UPDATING
       PENDING; or

   -   if the attach attempt counter is greater or equal to 5, then the mobile station shall delete any LAI, TMSI,
       ciphering key sequence number stored in the SIM/USIM and list of equivalent PLMNs and set the update status
       to U2 NOT UPDATED.
       A GPRS MS operating in MS operation mode A shall then proceed with appropriate MM specific procedure; a
       GPRS MS operating in MS operation mode B may then proceed with appropriate MM specific procedures.
       The MM sublayer shall act as in network operation mode II as long as the combined GMM procedures are not
       successful and no new RA is entered. The new MM state is MM IDLE substate ATTEMPTING TO UPDATE or
       optionally MM IDLE substate PLMN SEARCH in order to perform a PLMN selection according to
       3GPP TS 23.122 [14].

4.7.4         GPRS detach procedure

4.7.4.0          General
The GPRS detach procedure is used:

   -   to detach the IMSI for GPRS services only. Independent of the network operation mode, this procedure is used
       by all kind of GPRS MSs;

   -   as a combined GPRS detach procedure used by GPRS MSs operating in MS operation mode A or B to detach the
       IMSI for GPRS and non-GPRS services or for non-GPRS services only, if the network operates in network
       operation mode I and no circuit-switched transaction is ongoing;

   -   in the case of a network failure condition to indicate to the MS that a re-attach with successive activation of
       previously active PDP contexts shall be performed. In this case, the MS may also perform the procedures needed
       in order to activate any previously active multicast service(s); or

   -   to detach the IMSI or IMEI for emergency bearer services.

After completion of a GPRS detach procedure or combined GPRS detach procedure for GPRS and non-GPRS services
the GMM context is released.

An eCall only mobile station that is not capable of eCall over IMS shall not perform any kind of GPRS detach
procedure.

The GPRS detach procedure shall be invoked by the MS if the MS is switched off, the SIM/USIM card is removed from
the MS or if the GPRS or non-GPRS capability of the MS is disabled. The procedure may be invoked by the network to
detach the IMSI for GPRS services. The GPRS detach procedure causes the MS to be marked as inactive in the network
for GPRS services, non-GPRS services or both services.

If the detach procedure is triggered due to SIM/USIM removal, the MS shall indicate "switch off" in the detach type IE.

If a detach is requested by the HLR for an MS that has a PDP context for emergency services, the SGSN shall not send
a DETACH REQUEST message to the MS, and shall follow the procedure described in subclause 6.1.3.4.2 for an MS
that has PDP contexts for emergency bearer services.

When upper layers indicates that emergency bearer services are no longer required, the MS if still attached for
emergency bearer services, may perform a detach followed by a re-attach to regain normal services, if the MS is in or
moves to a suitable cell.

In A/Gb mode, if the GPRS detach procedure is performed, the PDP contexts and the MBMS contexts, if any, are
deactivated locally without peer to peer signalling between the SM and LLC entities in the MS and the network.

In Iu mode, if the GPRS detach procedure is performed, the PDP contexts and the MBMS contexts, if any, are
deactivated locally without peer to peer signalling between the SM entities in the MS and the network.

If the MS supports S1 mode, the MS shall store the TIN in the non-volatile memory in the ME, as described in
3GPP TS 24.301 [120], annex C, for a subsequent attach procedure.

The MS is allowed to initiate the GPRS detach procedure even if the timer T3346 is running.

The network proceeds with the GPRS detach procedure even if NAS level mobility management congestion control is
active.

4.7.4.1          MS initiated GPRS detach procedure

4.7.4.1.1            MS initiated GPRS detach procedure initiation
The GPRS detach procedure is initiated by the MS by sending a DETACH REQUEST message. The detach type
information element may indicate "GPRS detach with switching off", "GPRS detach without switching off", "IMSI
detach", "GPRS/IMSI detach with switching off" or "GPRS/IMSI detach without switching off".

If the MS has a valid P-TMSI, the MS shall include the P-TMSI in the DETACH REQUEST message. The MS shall
also include a valid P-TMSI signature, if available.



                                                         ETSI
3GPP TS 24.008 version 15.8.0 Release 15                   182                        ETSI TS 124 008 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


If the MS is not switched off and the MS is in the state GMM_REGISTERED, timer T3321 shall be started after the
DETACH REQUEST message has been sent. If the detach type information element value indicates "IMSI Detach" the
MS shall enter GMM-REGISTERED.IMSI-DETACH_INITIATED, otherwise the MS shall enter the state GMM-
DEREGISTERED-INITIATED. If the detach type information element value indicates "IMSI Detach" or "GPRS/IMSI
Detach", state MM IMSI DETACH PENDING is entered. If the MS to be switched off is not a MS using any of the
coverage classes of EC-GSM-IoT, the MS shall try for a period of 5 seconds to send the DETACH REQUEST message.
If the MS to be switched off is a MS using any of the coverage classes of EC-GSM-IoT, that MS should try for at least a
period of 10 seconds to send the DETACH REQUEST message. If the MS is able to send the DETACH REQUEST
message during this time the MS may be switched off.

If the detach type information element value indicates "GPRS detach without switching off " and the MS is attached for
GPRS and non-GPRS services and the network operates in network operation mode I, then if in the MS the timer T3212
is not already running, the timer T3212 shall be set to its initial value and restarted after the DETACH REQUEST
message has been sent.

4.7.4.1.2            MS initiated GPRS detach procedure completion for GPRS services only
When the DETACH REQUEST message is received by the network, the network shall send a DETACH ACCEPT
message to the MS, if the detach type IE value indicates that the detach request has not been sent due to switching off. If
switching off was indicated, the procedure is completed when the network receives the DETACH REQUEST message.
The network and the MS shall deactivate the PDP contexts, the MBMS contexts and deactivate the logical link(s), if
any.

The MS is marked as inactive in the network for GPRS services; state GMM-DEREGISTERED is entered in the MS
and the network.

In Iu mode, if the detach has been sent due to switching off, then the network shall release the resources in the lower
layers for this MS (see 3GPP TS 25.331 [23c]).

   NOTE:      When the DETACH REQUEST message is received by the network, and if the detach type IE value
              indicates that the detach is not due to power off, the authentication and ciphering procedure as well as the
              identification procedure may be performed.

If the MS supports S1 mode and operates in MS operation mode A or B , the MS shall disable the E-UTRA capability
(see 3GPP TS 24.301 [120]).

4.7.4.1.3            MS initiated combined GPRS detach procedure completion
When the DETACH REQUEST message is received by the network, a DETACH ACCEPT message shall be sent to the
MS, if the detach type IE value indicates that the detach request has not been sent due to switching off. Depending on
the value of the detach type IE the following applies:

GPRS/IMSI detach:
The MS is marked as inactive in the network for GPRS and for non-GPRS services. The network and the MS shall
deactivate the PDP contexts, the MBMS contexts and deactivate the logical link(s), if any. The States GMM-
DEREGISTERED and MM NULL are entered in both the MS and the network.

In Iu mode, if the detach has been sent due to switching off, then the network shall release the resources in the lower
layers for this MS (see 3GPP TS 25.331 [23c]).

IMSI detach:
The MS is marked as inactive in the network for non-GPRS services. State MM NULL is entered in the MS and the
network.

4.7.4.1.4            Abnormal cases in the MS
The following abnormal cases can be identified:

   a) T3321 time-out

       On the first expiry of the timer, the MS shall retransmit the DETACH REQUEST message and shall reset and
       restart timer T3321. This retransmission is repeated four times, i.e. on the fifth expiry of timer T3321, the GPRS
       detach procedure shall be aborted, the MS shall change to state:



                                                          ETSI
3GPP TS 24.008 version 15.8.0 Release 15                  183                       ETSI TS 124 008 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


      -   MM-NULL if "IMSI detach" was requested;

      -   GMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE if "IMSI Detach" was requested;

      -   GMM-DEREGISTERED if "GPRS detach" was requested;

      -   GMM-DEREGISTERED and MM-NULL if "GPRS/IMSI" detach was requested.

   b) Lower layer failure before reception of DETACH ACCEPT message

      The detach procedure is aborted and the MS shall change to one of the following states, except in the following
      implementation option cases b.1, b.2 and b3:

      -   MM-NULL if "IMSI detach" was requested;

      -   GMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE if "IMSI Detach" was requested;

      -   GMM-DEREGISTERED if "GPRS detach" was requested;

      -   GMM-DEREGISTERED and MM-NULL if "IMSI/GPRS" detach was requested.

   b.1)   Release of PS signalling connection before the completion of the GPRS detach procedure

      The release of the PS signalling connection before completion of the GPRS detach procedure shall result in the
      GPRS detach procedure being initiated again, if the following conditions apply:

          i) The original GPRS detach procedure was initiated over an existing PS signalling connection; and

          ii) No SECURITY MODE COMMAND message and no Non-Access Stratum (NAS) messages relating to
          the PS signalling connection (e.g. PS authentication procedure, see subclause 4.7.7) were received after the
          DETACH REQUEST message was transmitted.

   b.2) RR release in Iu mode (i.e. RRC connection release) with cause different than "Directed signalling
       connection re-establishment", for example, "Normal", or"User inactivity" (see 3GPP TS 25.331 [23c] and
       3GPP TS 44.118 [111])

      The GPRS detach procedure shall be initiated again, if the following conditions apply:

          i) The original GPRS detach procedure was initiated over an exisiting RRC connection; and

          ii) No SECURITY MODE COMMAND message and no Non-Access Stratum (NAS) messages relating to
          the PS signalling connection (e.g. PS authentication procedure, see subclause 4.7.7) were received after the
          DETACH REQUEST message was transmitted.

   NOTE:     The RRC connection release cause different than "Directed signalling connection re-establishment" that
             triggers the re-initiation of the GPRS detach procedure is implementation specific.

   b.3) RR release in Iu mode (i.e. RRC connection release) with cause "Directed signalling connection re-
       establishment" (see 3GPP TS 25.331 [23c] and 3GPP TS 44.118 [111])

      The routing area updating procedure shall be initiated followed by completion of the GPRS detach procedure if
      the following conditions apply:

          i) The original GPRS detach procedure was not due to SIM removal; and

          ii) The original GPRS detach procedure was not due to a rerun of the procedure due to "Directed signalling
          connection reestablishment".

   c) Detach procedure collision

      GPRS detach containing cause "power off":

      -   If the MS receives a DETACH REQUEST message before the MS initiated GPRS detach procedure has been
          completed, this message shall be ignored and the MS initiated GPRS detach procedure shall continue.

      GPRS detach containing other causes than "power off":




                                                         ETSI
3GPP TS 24.008 version 15.8.0 Release 15                 184                       ETSI TS 124 008 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


      -   If the MS receives a DETACH REQUEST message before the MS initiated GPRS detach procedure has been
          completed, the MS shall treat the message as specified in subclause 4.7.4.2.2 with the following
          modifications:

          -   If the DETACH REQUEST message received by the MS contains detach type "re-attach required", and
              the MS initiated detach procedure is with detach type "GPRS detach" or "Combined GPRS/IMSI detach",
              the MS need not initiate the GPRS attach or combined GPRS attach procedure.

          -   If the DETACH REQUEST message received by the MS contains detach type "IMSI detach", and the MS
              initiated detach procedure is with detach type "IMSI detach", the MS in operation mode A or B in
              network operation mode I need not re-attach to non-GPRS services.

          -   If the DETACH REQUEST message received by the MS contains detach type "IMSI detach", and the MS
              initiated detach procedure is with detach type "GPRS detach" or "combined GPRS/IMSI detach", the MS
              shall progress both procedures. The MS in operation mode A or B in network operation mode I need not
              re-attach to non-GPRS services.

   d) Detach and GMM common procedure collision

      GPRS detach containing cause "power off":

      -   If the MS receives a message used in a GMM common procedure before the GPRS detach procedure has
          been completed, this message shall be ignored and the GPRS detach procedure shall continue.

      GPRS detach containing other causes than "power off" and containing detach type "IMSI detach":

      -   If the MS receives a message used in a GMM common procedure before the GPRS detach procedure has
          been completed, both the GMM common procedure and the GPRS detach procedure shall continue.

      GPRS detach containing other causes than "power off" and containing other detach types than "IMSI detach":

      -   If the MS receives a P-TMSI REALLOCATION COMMAND, a GMM STATUS, or a GMM
          INFORMATION message before the GPRS detach procedure has been completed, this message shall be
          ignored and the GPRS detach procedure shall continue.

      -   If the MS receives an AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING REQUEST or IDENTITY REQUEST
          message, before the GPRS detach procedure has been completed, the MS shall respond to it as described in
          subclauses 4.7.7 and 4.7.8 respectively.

   e) Change of cell within the same RA (A/Gb mode only)

      If a cell change occurs within the same RA before a DETACH ACCEPT message has been received, then the
      cell update procedure shall be performed before completion of the detach procedure.

   f) Change of cell into a new routing area

      If a cell change into a new routing area occurs before a DETACH ACCEPT message has been received, the
      GPRS detach procedure shall be aborted and re-initiated after successfully performing a routing area updating
      procedure. If the detach procedure is performed due to the removal of the SIM/USIM or the MS is to be switched
      off, the MS shall abort the detach procedure and enter the state GMM-DEREGISTERED.

   g) Access barred because of access class control or EAB

      The signalling procedure for GPRS detach shall not be started. The MS starts the signalling procedure as soon as
      possible and if still necessary, i.e. when the barred state is removed or because of a cell change, or performs a
      local detach immediately or after an implementation dependent time.

   h) Detach and paging for non-GRPS services procedure collision

      If the MS receives a paging for non-GPRS services before the MS initiated combined GPRS detach procedure
      with detach type "IMSI detach" or "GPRS/IMSI detach" has been completed, then the paging for non-GPRS
      services shall be ignored and the MS initiated combined GPRS detach procedure shall continue.

4.7.4.1.5            Abnormal cases on the network side
The following abnormal cases can be identified:

   a) Detach request received in a CSG cell for which the MS has no valid CSG subscription

       If the MS initiates a detach procedure in a CSG cell the CSG ID of which is not valid for the MS and the detach
       procedure is not due to "switch off", the network shall proceed as follows:

       -   if the detach type is "IMSI detach" and the MS has a PDN connection for emergency bearer services active,
           the SGSN shall send a DETACH ACCEPT message and deactivate all non-emergency PDP contexts, if any,
           by initiating a PDP context deactivation procedure;

       -   otherwise, the network shall initiate the detach procedure. The network shall send a DETACH REQUEST
           message including the GMM cause value #25 "not authorized for this CSG".

4.7.4.2           Network initiated GPRS detach procedure

4.7.4.2.1            Network initiated GPRS detach procedure initiation
The network initiates the GPRS detach procedure by sending a DETACH REQUEST message to the MS. The
DETACH REQUEST message shall include a detach type IE. In addition, the network may include a cause IE to
specify the reason for the detach request. The network shall start timer T3322. If the detach type IE indicates "re-attach
required", or "re-attach not required" and the cause code is not #2 "IMSI unknown in HLR", the network shall
deactivate the PDP contexts, the MBMS contexts and deactivate the logical link(s), if any, and shall change to state
GMM-DEREGISTERED-INITIATED.

4.7.4.2.2            Network initiated GPRS detach procedure completion by the MS
When receiving the DETACH REQUEST message and the detach type indicates "re-attach required", the MS shall
deactivate the PDP context(s), the MBMS context(s) and deactivate the logical link(s), if any. The MS shall stop the
timer T3346, if it is running. The MS shall also stop timer(s) T3396, if it is running. The MS shall send a DETACH
ACCEPT message to the network and shall enter the state GMM-DEREGISTERED. The MS shall, after the completion
of the GPRS detach procedure, initiate a GPRS attach procedure. The MS should also activate PDP context(s) that were
originally activated by the MS to replace any previously MS activated PDP context(s). The MS should also perform the
procedures needed in order to activate any previously active multicast service(s).

   NOTE 1: When the detach type indicates "re-attach required", user interaction is necessary in some cases when the
           MS cannot re-activate the PDP/MBMS context(s) automatically.

A GPRS MS operating in MS operation mode A or B in network operation mode I, which receives an DETACH
REQUEST message with detach type indicating "re-attach required" or "re-attach not required" and no cause code, is
only detached for GPRS services in the network.



                                                           ETSI
3GPP TS 24.008 version 15.8.0 Release 15                    186                       ETSI TS 124 008 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


When receiving the DETACH REQUEST message and the detach type IE indicates "IMSI detach", the MS shall not
deactivate the PDP/MBMS contexts. The MS shall set the MM update status to U2 NOT UPDATED. An MS in
operation mode A or B in network operation mode I may send a DETACH ACCEPT message to the network, and shall
re-attach to non-GPRS service by performing the combined routing area updating procedure according to
subclause 4.7.5.2, sending a ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message with Update type IE indicating
"combined RA/LA updating with IMSI attach". An MS in operation mode A that is in an ongoing circuit-switched
transaction shall initiate the combined routing area updating after the circuit-switched transaction has been released. An
MS in operation mode C, or in MS operation mode A or B in network operation mode II, shall send a DETACH
ACCEPT message to the network.

If the detach type IE indicates "IMSI detach", or "re-attach required" then the MS shall ignore the cause code if
received.

If the MS is attached for GPRS and non-GPRS services and the network operates in network operation mode I, then if
in the MS the timer T3212 is not already running, the timer T3212 shall be set to its initial value and restarted if:

   -    the detach type IE indicates "re-attach required"; or

   -    the detach type IE indicates "re-attach not required" and no cause code is included.

When receiving the DETACH REQUEST message and the detach type IE indicates "re-attach not required" and no
cause code, or "re-attach not required" and the cause code is not #2 "IMSI unknown in HLR", the MS shall deactivate
the PDP contexts, the MBMS contexts and deactivate the logical link(s), if any. The MS shall then send a DETACH
ACCEPT message to the network and shall change state to GMM-DEREGISTERED.

If the detach type IE indicates "re-attach not required" and no cause code is included,

   -    the MS shall set the GPRS update status to GU2 NOT UPDATED, delete the GMM parameters P-TMSI, P-
        TMSI signature, RAI, and GPRS ciphering key sequence number, and start timer T3302. If the MS is operating
        in MS operation mode C, it may enter the state GMM-DEREGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH in order to perform a
        PLMN selection according to 3GPP TS 23.122 [6]; otherwise the MS shall enter the state GMM-
        DEREGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-ATTACH; and

   -    if S1 mode is supported in the MS, the MS shall handle the EMM parameters EMM state, EPS update status,
        GUTI, last visited registered TAI, TAI list and KSI, as specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 [120] for the case when a
        DETACH REQUEST is received with the no EMM cause included and with detach type set to "re-attach not
        required".

If the detach type IE indicates "re-attach not required" and a cause code is included, then, depending on the received
cause code, the MS shall act as follows:

   #2      (IMSI unknown in HLR);

        The MS shall set the update status to U3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED and shall delete any TMSI, LAI and
        ciphering key sequence number. The new MM state is MM IDLE. The SIM/USIM shall be considered as invalid
        for non-GPRS services until switching off or the SIM/USIM is removed. If the message has been successfully
        integrity checked by the lower layers and the MS maintains a counter for "SIM/USIM considered invalid for
        non-GPRS services", then the MS shall set this counter to MS implementation-specific maximum value.

        A GPRS MS operating in MS operation mode A or B in network operation mode I, is still IMSI attached for
        GPRS services in the network.

   #3      (Illegal MS);

   #6      (Illegal ME);

        The MS shall set the GPRS update status to GU3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED (and shall store it according to
        subclause 4.1.3.2) and shall delete any P-TMSI, P-TMSI signature, RAI and GPRS ciphering key sequence
        number. The MS shall delete the list of equivalent PLMNs. The new GMM state is GMM-DEREGISTERED.
        The SIM/USIM shall be considered as invalid for GPRS services until switching off or the SIM/USIM is
        removed. If the message has been successfully integrity checked by the lower layers and the MS maintains a
        counter for "SIM/USIM considered invalid for GPRS services", then the MS shall set this counter to MS
        implementation-specific maximum value.

        A GPRS MS operating in MS operation mode A or B shall in addition set the update status to U3 ROAMING
        NOT ALLOWED, shall delete any TMSI, LAI and ciphering key sequence number. If the MS is operating in
        MS operation mode A and an RR connection exists, the MS shall abort the RR connection, unless an emergency
        call is ongoing. The SIM/USIM shall be considered as invalid also for non-GPRS services until switching off or
        the SIM/USIM is removed. If the message has been successfully integrity checked by the lower layers and the
        MS maintains a counter for "SIM/USIM considered invalid for non-GPRS services", then the MS shall set this
        counter to MS implementation-specific maximum value.

        If S1 mode is supported in the MS, the MS shall handle the EMM parameters EMM state, EPS update status,
        GUTI, last visited registered TAI, TAI list and KSI as specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 [120] for the case when a
        DETACH REQUEST is received with the EMM cause with the same value and with detach type set to "re-attach
        not required".

   NOTE 2: The possibility to configure an MS so that the radio transceiver for a specific radio access technology is
           not active, although it is implemented in the MS, is out of scope of the present specification.

   #7      (GPRS services not allowed);

        The MS shall set the GPRS update status to GU3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED (and shall store it according to
        subclause 4.1.3.2) and shall delete any P-TMSI, P-TMSI signature, RAI and GPRS ciphering key sequence
        number. The SIM/USIM shall be considered as invalid for GPRS services until switching off or the SIM/USIM
        is removed. The new state is GMM-DEREGISTERED. If the message has been successfully integrity checked
        by the lower layers and the MS maintains a counter for "SIM/USIM considered invalid for GPRS services", then
        the MS shall set this counter to MS implementation-specific maximum value.

        A GPRS MS operating in MS operation mode C shall delete the list of equivalent PLMNs.

        A GPRS MS operating in MS operation mode A or B which is already IMSI attached for CS services is still
        IMSI attached for CS services in the network.

        A GPRS MS operating in MS operation mode A or B in network operation mode I shall then proceed with the
        appropriate MM specific procedure.

   NOTE 3: Optionally the MS starts the timer T3340 as described in subclause 4.7.1.9.

        If S1 mode is supported in the MS, the MS shall handle the EMM parameters EMM state, EPS update status,
        GUTI, last visited registered TAI, TAI list and KSI as specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 [120] for the case when a
        DETACH REQUEST is received with the EMM cause with the same value and with detach type set to "re-attach
        not required".

   #8      (GPRS services and non-GPRS services not allowed);

        The MS shall set the GPRS update status to GU3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED (and shall store it according to
        subclause 4.1.3.2) and shall delete any P-TMSI, P-TMSI signature, RAI and GPRS ciphering key sequence
        number. The MS shall delete the list of equivalent PLMNs. The new GMM state is GMM-DEREGISTERED.

        The MS shall set the update status to U3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED, shall delete any TMSI, LAI and
        ciphering key sequence number. If the MS is operating in MS operation mode A and an RR connection exists,
        the MS shall abort the RR connection, unless an emergency call is ongoing. The SIM/USIM shall be considered
        as invalid for GPRS and non-GPRS services until switching off or the SIM/USIM is removed. If the message has
        been successfully integrity checked by the lower layers and the MS maintains a counter for "SIM/USIM
        considered invalid for GPRS services", then the MS shall set this counter to MS implementation-specific
        maximum value. If the message has been successfully integrity checked by the lower layers and the MS
        maintains a counter for "SIM/USIM considered invalid for non-GPRS services", then the MS shall set this
        counter to MS implementation-specific maximum value.

   NOTE 4: Optionally the MS starts the timer T3340 as described in subclause 4.7.1.9.

        If S1 mode is supported in the MS, the MS shall handle the EMM parameters EMM state, EPS update status,
        GUTI, last visited registered TAI, TAI list and KSI as specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 [120] for the case when a

      The MS shall store the PLMN identity in the "forbidden PLMN list" and if the MS is configured to use timer
      T3245 (see 3GPP TS 24.368 [135] or 3GPP TS 31.102 [112]) then the MS shall start timer T3245 and proceed
      as described in subclause 4.1.1.6. If the message has been successfully integrity checked by the lower layers and
      the MS maintains a PLMN-specific attempt counter for that PLMN, then the MS shall set this counter to the MS
      implementation-specific maximum value.

      The MS shall start timer T3340 as described in subclause 4.7.1.9.

      If no RR connection exists, the MS shall perform the following additional actions immediately. If the MS is
      operating in MS operation mode A and an RR connection exists, the MS shall perform these actions when the
      RR connection is subsequently released:

      -   A GPRS MS operating in MS operation mode A or B shall set the update status to U3 ROAMING NOT
          ALLOWED and shall delete any TMSI, LAI and ciphering key sequence number. The new MM state is MM
          IDLE.

      -   The MS shall perform a PLMN selection according to 3GPP TS 23.122 [14].

          An MS in GAN mode shall request a PLMN list in GAN (see 3GPP TS 44.318 [76b]) prior to perform a
          PLMN selection from this list according to 3GPP TS 23.122 [14].

      If S1 mode is supported in the MS, the MS shall handle the EMM parameters EMM state, EPS update status,
      GUTI, last visited registered TAI, TAI list, KSI and attach attempt counter as specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 [120]
      for the case when a DETACH REQUEST is received with the EMM cause with the same value and with detach

      If no RR connection exists, the MS shall perform the following additional actions immediately. If the MS is
      operating in MS operation mode A and an RR connection exists, the MS shall perform these actions when the
      RR connection is subsequently released:

      -   If the MS is IMSI attached, the MS shall set the update status to U3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED, shall
          delete any TMSI, LAI and ciphering key sequence number and shall reset the location update attempt
          counter. The new MM state is MM IDLE.

      -   The MS shall perform a cell selection according to 3GPP TS 43.022 [82] and 3GPP TS 25.304 [98].

   NOTE 5: The cell selection procedure is not applicable for an MS in GAN mode.

      If S1 mode is supported in the MS, the MS shall handle the EMM parameters EMM state, EPS update status,
      GUTI, last visited registered TAI, TAI list, KSI and attach attempt counter as specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 [120]
      for the case when a DETACH REQUEST is received with the EMM cause with the same value and with detach
      type set to "re-attach not required".

unknown in HLR", the network shall not change the current GMM state; otherwise the network shall change state to
GMM-DEREGISTERED.

4.7.4.2.4            Abnormal cases on the network side
The following abnormal cases can be identified:

   a) T3322 time-out

       On the first expiry of the timer, the network shall retransmit the DETACH REQUEST message and shall start
       timer T3322. This retransmission is repeated four times, i.e. on the fifth expiry of timer T3322, the GPRS detach
       procedure shall be aborted. If the detach type indicates "IMSI detach", or "re-attach not required" and the cause
       code is #2 "IMSI unknown in HLR", the network shall not change the current GMM state; otherwise the network
       shall change state to GMM-DEREGISTERED.

   b) Low layer failure

      The GPRS detach procedure is aborted. If the detach type indicates "IMSI detach", or "re-attach not required"
      and the cause code is #2 "IMSI unknown in HLR", the network shall not change the current GMM state;
      otherwise the network shall change state to GMM-DEREGISTERED.

   c) GPRS detach procedure collision

      If the network receives a DETACH REQUEST message with "switching off" indicated, before the network
      initiated GPRS detach procedure has been completed, both procedures shall be considered completed.

      If the network receives a DETACH REQUEST message without "switching off" indicated, before the network
      initiated GPRS detach procedure has been completed, the network shall send a DETACH ACCEPT message to
      the MS.

   d) GPRS detach and GPRS attach procedure collision

      If the network receives an ATTACH REQUEST message before the network initiated GPRS detach procedure
      with type of detach 're-attach not required' has been completed, the network shall ignore the ATTACH
      REQUEST message. If the detach type IE value, sent in the DETACH REQUEST message, indicates "re-attach
      required" the detach procedure is aborted and the GPRS attach procedure shall be progressed after the PDP
      contexts and MBMS contexts, if any, have been deleted. If the detach type IE value, sent in the DETACH
      REQUEST message, indicates "IMSI detach" the detach procedure is aborted and the GPRS attach procedure
      shall be progressed.

   e) GPRS detach and routing area updating procedure collision

      GPRS detach containing detach type "re-attach required" or "re-attach not required":

         If the network receives a ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message before the network initiated
         GPRS detach procedure has been completed, the detach procedure shall be progressed, i.e. the ROUTING
         AREA UPDATE REQUEST message shall be ignored. If the DETACH REQUEST message contains detach
         type "re-attach not required" and GMM cause #2 "IMSI unknown in HLR", the network will follow the
         procedure as described below for the detach type "IMSI detach".

      GPRS detach containing detach type "IMSI detach":

         If the network receives a ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message before the network initiated
         GPRS detach procedure has been completed, the network shall abort the detach procedure, shall stop T3322
         and shall progress the routing area update procedure.

   f) GPRS detach and service request procedure collision

      GPRS detach containing detach type "re-attach required" or "re-attach not required":

      If the network receives a SERVICE REQUEST message before the network initiated GPRS detach procedure
      has been completed, the network shall progress the detach procedure. If the GPRS Detach Request message
      contains detach type "re-attach not required" and GMM cause #2 "IMSI unknown in HLR", the network will
      follow the procedure as described below for the detach type "IMSI detach".

      GPRS detach containing detach type "IMSI detach":

      If the network receives a SERVICE REQUEST message before the network initiated GPRS detach procedure
      has been completed, the network shall progress both procedures.

4.7.5         Routing area updating procedure
This procedure is used for:

   -   normal routing area updating to update the registration of the actual routing area of an MS in the network. This
       procedure is used by GPRS MSs in MS operation mode C and by GPRS MSs in MS operation modes A or B that
       are IMSI attached for GPRS and non-GPRS services if the network operates in network operation mode II;

   -   combined routing area updating to update the registration of the actual routing and location area of an MS in the
       network. This procedure is used by GPRS MSs in MS operation modes A or B that are IMSI attached for GPRS
       and non-GPRS services provided that the network operates in network operation mode I;

   -   periodic routing area updating. This procedure is used by GPRS MSs in MS operation mode C and by GPRS
       MSs in MS operation modes A or B that are IMSI attached for GPRS or for GPRS and non-GPRS services
       independent of the network operation mode;

   -   IMSI attach for non-GPRS services when the MS is IMSI attached for GPRS services. This procedure is used by
       GPRS MSs in MS operation modes A or B, if the network operates in network operation mode I;

   -   in A/Gb mode, resuming GPRS services when the RR sublayer indicated a resumption failure after dedicated
       mode was left, see 3GPP TS 44.018 [84];

   -   in A/Gb mode, updating the network with the new MS Radio Access Capability IE when the content of the IE
       has changed;

   -   updating the network with the new DRX parameter IE when the content of the IE has changed;

   NOTE 1: Such changes can be used e.g. when the MS activates a PDP context with service requirements that
           cannot be met with the current DRX parameter. As PDP context(s) are activated and deactivated, the
           GMM context will be updated with an appropriate DRX parameter;

   -   re-negotiation of the READY timer value;

   -   Iu mode to A/Gb mode and for A/Gb mode to Iu mode intersystem change, see subclause 4.7.1.7;

   -   in Iu mode, re-synchronizing the PMM mode of MS and network after RRC connection release with cause
       "Directed signalling connection re-establishment", see subclause 4.7.2.5;

   -   in Iu mode and A/Gb mode after intersystem change from S1 mode, and the GMM receives an indication of
       "RRC connection failure" from lower layers due to lower layer failure while in S1 mode;

   -   S1 mode to Iu mode or S1 mode to A/Gb mode intersystem change and ISR is not activated;

   -   S1 mode to Iu mode or S1 mode to A/Gb mode intersystem change and ISR is activated, but the MS changes to a
       routeing area it has not previously registered with the network;

   -   indicating to the network that due to a manual CSG selection the MS has selected a CSG cell whose CSG
       identity and associated PLMN identity are not included in the MS's Allowed CSG list or in the MS's Operator
       CSG list;

   -   indicating to the network that the mobile station classmark 2, mobile station classmark 3 or the supported codecs
       have changed for a MS supporting SRVCC; or

   -   indicating the current radio access technology to the network for the support of terminating access domain
       selection for voice calls or voice sessions (for details see subclause 4.7.5.1 and subclause 4.7.5.2.1).

While an MS has a PDN connection for emergency bearer services, the MS shall not perform manual CSG selection.

The routing area updating procedure shall also be used by a MS which is attached for GPRS services if a new PLMN is
entered (see 3GPP TS 23.122 [14]), unless the MS is configured for "AttachWithIMSI" as specified in
3GPP TS 24.368 [135] or 3GPP TS 31.102 [112] and the new PLMN is neither the registered PLMN nor in the list of
equivalent PLMNs.

An eCall only mobile station that is not capable of eCall over IMS shall not perform a normal or combined routing area
updating procedure.

Subclause 4.7.5.1 describes the routing area updating procedures for updating the routing area only. The combined
routing area updating procedure used to update both the routing and location area is described in subclause 4.7.5.2.

The routing area updating procedure is always initiated by the MS. It is only invoked in state GMM-REGISTERED.

To limit the number of consecutive rejected routing area update attempts, a routing area updating attempt counter is
introduced. The routing area updating attempt counter shall be incremented as specified in subclause 4.7.5.1.5.
Depending on the value of the routing area updating attempt counter, specific actions shall be performed. The routing
area updating attempt counter shall be reset when:

   -   a GPRS attach or combined GPRS attach procedure is successfully completed;

   -   a normal or periodic routing area updating or combined routing area updating procedure is successfully
       completed;

   -   a combined GPRS attach procedure or a combined routing area updating procedure is completed for GPRS
       services only with cause #2 or #28;

   -   a normal or periodic routing area updating or combined routing updating procedure is rejected with cause #11,
       #12, #13, #14, #15 or #25;

   -   a new PLMN is selected.

and additionally when the MS is in substate ATTEMPTING-TO-UPDATE:

   -   a new routing area is entered;

   -   expiry of timer T3302;

   -   at request from registration function; or

   -   timer T3346 is started.

The mobile equipment shall contain a list of "forbidden location areas for roaming", as well as a list of "forbidden
location areas for regional provision of service". The handling of these lists is described in subclause 4.4.1.

In a shared network, the MS shall choose one of the PLMN identities as specified in 3GPP TS 23.122 [14]. The MS
shall construct the Routing Area Identification of the cell from this chosen PLMN identity, and the LAC and the RAC
received on the BCCH. If the constructed RAI is different from the stored RAI, the MS shall initiate the routing area
updating procedure. For:

   -   a shared GERAN, in A/Gb mode, the chosen PLMN identity is indicated to the GERAN in the first RLC data
       block of an upper layer PDU (see 3GPP TS 44.060 [76]) when a foreign TLLI is used by the network sharing
       supporting MS for the transmission.

   -   a shared UTRAN, the chosen PLMN identity shall be indicated to the UTRAN in the RRC INITIAL DIRECT
       TRANSFER message (see 3GPP TS 25.331 [23c]).

For GERAN Iu mode, network sharing is not supported.

Whenever a ROUTING AREA UPDATE REJECT message with the cause "PLMN not allowed" is received by the MS,
the chosen PLMN identity shall be stored in the "forbidden PLMN list" and if the MS is configured to use timer T3245
(see 3GPP TS 24.368 [135] or 3GPP TS 31.102 [112]) then the MS shall start timer T3245 and proceed as described in
subclause 4.1.1.6. Whenever a ROUTING AREA UPDATE REJECT message is received by the MS with the cause
"Roaming not allowed in this location area", "Location Area not allowed", or "No suitable cells in Location Area", the
LAI that is part of the constructed RAI which triggered the routing area updating procedure shall be stored in the
suitable list.

In A/Gb mode, user data transmission in the MS shall be suspended during the routing area updating procedure, except
if the routing area updating procedure is triggered by a PS handover procedure as described in 3GPP TS 43.129 [113];
user data reception shall be possible. User data transmission in the network may be suspended during the routing area
updating procedure.

In Iu mode, user data transmission and reception in the MS shall not be suspended during the routing area updating
procedure. User data transmission in the network shall not be suspended during the routing area updating procedure.

In Iu mode, when a ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST is received by the SGSN over a new PS signalling
connection while there is an ongoing PS signalling connection (network is already in mode PMM-CONNECTED) for
this MS, the network shall progress the routing area updating procedure as normal and release the previous PS
signalling connection when the routing area updating procedure has been accepted by the network.

   NOTE 2: The re-establishment of the radio bearers of active PDP contexts is done as described in subclause
           "Service Request procedure".

The network informs the MS about the support of specific features, such as LCS-MOLR, MBMS, IMS voice over PS
session, emergency bearer services in Iu mode in the Network feature support information element. The information is
either explicitly given by sending the Network feature support IE or implicitly by not sending it. The handling in the
network is described in subclause 9.4.15.11The network can also use the Additional network feature support IE in order
to inform the MS about the support of specific features such as the delivery of SMS via GPRS (GPRS-SMS) or
implicitly by not sending it. The MS may use the support indications for LCS-MOLR, MBMS and GPRS-SMS to
inform the user about the availability of the appropriate services. The MS shall not request the LCS-MOLR or
MBMSservices, if the service has not been indicated as available. The indication for MBMS is defined in subclause
"MBMS feature support indication" in 3GPP TS 23.246 [106]. In an MS with IMS voice over PS capability, the IMS
voice over PS session indicator and the emergency bearer services indicator shall be provided to the upper layers. The
upper layers take the IMS voice over PS session indicator into account as specified in 3GPP TS 23.221 [131],
subclause 7.2a and subclause 7.2b, when selecting the access domain for voice sessions or calls in Iu mode. When
initiating an emergency call in Iu mode, the upper layers also take the emergency bearer services indicator into account
for the access domain selection. The MS may use the GPRS-SMS indication in order to obtain SMS.

4.7.5.1           Normal and periodic routing area updating procedure
Periodic routing area updating is used to periodically notify the availability of the MS to the network. The value of the
update type IE in the ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message shall indicate "periodic updating". The
procedure is controlled in the MS by timer T3312. When timer T3312 expires, the periodic routing area updating
procedure is started. Start and reset of timer T3312 is described in subclause 4.7.2.2.

The normal routing area updating procedure is initiated:

   -   when the MS detects a change of the routing area in state GMM-REGISTERED;

   -   when the MS determines that GPRS resumption shall be performed;

   -   when the MS needs to update the network with the new MS Radio Access Capability IE;

   -   when the MS needs to update the network with the new DRX parameter IE;

   -   in Iu mode, to re-synchronize the PMM mode of MS and network after RRC connection release with cause
       "Directed signalling connection re-establishment", see subclause 4.7.2.5;

   -   in Iu mode, to re-synchronize the PMM mode of MS and network after inter-system change not due to PS
       handover from PMM-CONNECTED mode in Iu mode to A/Gb mode or S1 mode, if the MS performs an inter -
       system change back to Iu mode without sending a ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message while in
       A/Gb mode or a TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message while in S1 mode;

   -   in Iu mode and A/Gb mode, after intersystem change from S1 mode, and the GMM receives an indication of
       "RRC connection failure" from lower layers due to lower layer failure while in S1 mode. In this case, if the TIN
       indicates "RAT-related TMSI", the MS shall set the TIN to "GUTI" before initiating the routing area updating
       procedure;

   -   in A/Gb mode, after intersystem change from S1 mode if the TIN indicates "RAT-related TMSI", but the MS is
       required to perform routing area updating for IMS voice termination as specified in annex P.4;

   -   when the MS enters GMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE and the TIN indicates "GUTI";

   -   when the MS has selected a CSG cell whose CSG identity and associated PLMN identity are not included in the
       Allowed CSG list;or in the Operator CSG list;

   -   when the MS supports SRVCC and changes the mobile station classmark 2, mobile station classmark 3 or the
       supported codecs;

   -   when the MS changes the MS network capability information;

   -   when the UE's usage setting or the voice domain preference for E-UTRAN change in the MS;

   -   when the MS activates mobility management for IMS voice termination as specified in annex P.2 and the TIN
       indicates "RAT-related TMSI";

   -   upon reception of a paging indication, using P-TMSI, if the timer T3346 is running and the MS is in state GMM-
       REGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-UPDATE and the RAI of the current cell is same as the stored RAI;

   -   in A/Gb mode, after intersystem change from S1 mode via cell change order procedure not due to CS fallback, if
       the TIN indicates "RAT-related TMSI"; in this case the MS shall set the TIN to "GUTI" before initiating the
       routing area updating procedure;

   -   in A/Gb or Iu mode in NMO I, after intersystem change from S1 mode due to CS fallback, if the TIN indicates
       "GUTI" or if the routing area the MS is in is different from the registered routing area;

   -   in A/Gb mode, after Inter RAT handover from S1 mode or Iu mode;

   -   when the MS needs to request the use of PSM or needs to stop the use of PSM;

   -   when the MS needs to request the use of eDRX or needs to stop the use of eDRX;

   -   when a change in the PSM usage conditions at the MS requires a different timer T3312 value or different timer
       T3324 value;

   -   when a change in the eDRX usage conditions at the MS requires different extended DRX parameters; or

   NOTE 1: A change in the PSM or eDRX usage conditions at the MS can include e.g. a change in the MS
           configuration, a change in requirements from upper layers or the battery running low at the MS.

   -   when the Default_DCN_ID value changes, as specified in 3GPP TS 24.368 [135] or in USIM file NASCONFIG as

   NOTE 2: The routing area updating procedure is initiated after deleting the DCN-ID list as specified in
           3GPP TS 24.301 [120], annex C.

The ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message shall always be the first data sent by the MS when a routing area
border is crossed. The routing area identification is broadcast on the broadcast channel(s).

A normal routing area updating shall abort any ongoing GMM procedure. Aborted GMM procedures may be repeated
after the normal routing area updating procedure has been successfully performed. The value of the update type IE
included in the message shall indicate "RA updating".

If the normal routing area updating procedure is initiated due to the reception of the paging indication while timer
T3346 is running, the "follow-on request pending" indication shall be set to 1.

4.7.5.1.1            Normal and periodic routing area updating procedure initiation
To initiate the normal routing area updating procedure, the MS sends the message ROUTING AREA UPDATE
REQUEST to the network, starts timer T3330 and changes to state GMM-ROUTING-AREA-UPDATING-
INITIATED. If timer T3302 is currently running, the MS shall stop timer T3302. If timer T3311 is currently running,
the MS shall stop timer T3311.

If the MS supports S1 mode, the MS shall handle the P-TMSI IE as follows:

   -   If the TIN indicates "GUTI" and the MS holds a valid GUTI, the MS shall map the GUTI into a P-TMSI,
       P-TMSI signature and RAI as specified in 3GPP TS 23.003 [10]. The MS shall include the mapped RAI in the
       Old routing area identification IE and the mapped P-TMSI signature in the P-TMSI signature IE. In addition, the
       MS shall include the P-TMSI type IE with P-TMSI type set to "mapped P-TMSI". When the routing area
       updating procedure is initiated in Iu mode, the MS shall also include the mapped P-TMSI in the P-TMSI IE.
       Additionally, in Iu mode and A/Gb mode, if the MS holds a valid P-TMSI and RAI, the MS shall indicate the P-
       TMSI in the Additional mobile identity IE and the RAI in the Additional old routing area identification IE.

   -   If the TIN indicates "P-TMSI" or "RAT-related TMSI" and the MS holds a valid P-TMSI and RAI, the MS shall
       indicate the RAI in the Old routing area identification IE. In addition, the MS shall include the P-TMSI type IE
       with P-TMSI type set to "native P-TMSI". When the routing area updating procedure is initiated in Iu mode, the
       MS shall also include the P-TMSI in the P-TMSI IE.

If the MS does not support S1 mode, the MS shall include the P-TMSI type IE with P-TMSI type set to "native P-
TMSI".

If the MS supports PSM and requests the use of PSM, the MS shall include the T3324 value IE with a requested timer
value in the ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message. When the MS includes the T3324 value IE and the MS
indicates support for extended periodic timer value in the MS network feature support IE, it may also include the T3312
extended value IE to request a particular T3312 value to be allocated.

If the routing area updating procedure is not initiated by the MS due to an S1 mode to Iu mode or S1 mode to A/Gb
mode intersystem change, or if it is initiated due to such an intersystem change and the TIN indicates "RAT-related
TMSI", the MS shall use the existing UMTS security context for the PS domain. The ROUTING AREA UPDATE
REQUEST message shall contain the P-TMSI signature when received in a previous ATTACH ACCEPT or ROUTING
AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message. If the MS has a valid UMTS security context, the MS shall indicate it in the GPRS
ciphering key sequence number IE.

If the routing area updating procedure is initiated by the MS due to an S1 mode to Iu mode or S1 mode to A/Gb mode
inter-system change in idle mode, or if it is initiated by the MS due to PS to CS domain change from S1 mode due to
SRVCC or vSRVCC handover, and the TIN indicates "GUTI", the MS shall derive a UMTS security context for the PS
domain from the current EPS security context as described in the subclause 4.7.7.10. The ROUTING AREA UPDATE
REQUEST message shall include a P-TMSI signature filled with a NAS token as specified in 3GPP TS 33.401 [123].
Furthermore, the MS shall indicate the eKSI value, which is associated with the derived UMTS security keys, in the
CKSN field of the GPRS GSM ciphering key sequence number IE in the ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST
message.

   NOTE:      When the MS includes a P-TMSI signature filled with a NAS token, 8 bits of the NAS token will be filled
              with bits from the M-TMSI (see 3GPP TS 23.003 [10]).

If the routing area updating procedure is initiated by the MS due to the S1 mode to Iu mode or S1 mode to A/Gb mode
inter-system change in connected mode, the MS shall derive a UMTS security context for the PS domain from the
current EPS security context as described in the subclause 4.7.7.10. Furthermore, the MS shall indicate the eKSI value,
which is associated with the derived UMTS security keys, in the CKSN field of the GPRS GSM ciphering key sequence
number IE in the ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message.

In Iu mode, if the MS wishes to prolong the established PS signalling connection after the normal routing area updating
procedure (for example, the MS has any CM application request pending), it may set a follow-on request pending
indicator on (see subclause 4.7.13).

In order to indicate the new DRX parameter while in GERAN or UTRAN coverage, the MS shall send the ROUTING
AREA UPDATE REQUEST message containing the DRX parameter in the DRX parameter IE to the network, with the
exception of the case if the MS had indicated its MS specific DRX parameter (3GPP TS 24.301 [120]) to the network
while in E-UTRAN coverage. In this case, when the MS enters GERAN or UTRAN coverage and initiates a routing

area updating procedure, the MS shall not include the DRX parameter in the DRX parameter IE in the ROUTING
AREA UPDATE REQUEST message.

If the MS supports eDRX and requests the use of eDRX, the MS shall include the extended DRX parameters IE in the
ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message.

In A/Gb mode, if the MS supports the restriction on use of enhanced coverage, then the MS shall set the Restriction on
use of enhanced coverage capability bit to "Mobile station supports restriction on use of enhanced coverage" in the MS
network capability IE of the ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message

If the MS supports dual connectivity of E-UTRA with NR, then the MS shall set the Dual connectivity of E-UTRA with
NR capability bit to "Mobile station supports dual connectivity of E-UTRA with NR" in the MS network capability IE
of the ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message.

In A/Gb mode, if a UMTS security context is available and if the MS indicates support of integrity protection in the MS
network capability IE included in the ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, then the MS shall use the
current GPRS GSM Kint key and the current GPRS GSM integrity algorithm to integrity protect the ROUTING AREA
UPDATE REQUEST message in the LLC layer. If LLC layer has not yet been configured, then the GMM layer in the
MS shall assign the GPRS GSM Kint key, the GPRS GSM Kc128 key, the GPRS GSM integrity algorithm and the
GPRS GSM ciphering algorithm to the LLC layer, and indicates to the LLC layer that it shall start integrity protection.
This shall be done so that the LLC layer can integrity protect, but not cipher, the ROUTING AREA UPDATE
REQUEST message. The MS shall include the CKSN in the CKSN IE in the ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST
message. If the MS has no UMTS security context available, then the MS shall not integrity protect the ROUTING
AREA UPDATE REQUEST message in the LLC layer. The MS shall in this case set the CKSN IE to the value "no key
is available" and send the ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message unprotected.

4.7.5.1.2            GMM Common procedure initiation
If the network receives a ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message containing the P-TMSI type IE, and the
network does not follow the use of the most significant bit of the <LAC> to distinguish the node type as specified in
3GPP TS 23.003 [10] subclause 2.8.2.2.2, the network shall use the P-TMSI type IE to determine whether the mobile
identity included in the P-TMSI IE, if any, or the mobile identity used by the MS to derive a foreign TLLI (see
subclause 4.7.1.4.1) is a native P-TMSI or a mapped P-TMSI.

The network may initiate GMM common procedures, e.g. the GMM authentication and ciphering procedure.

4.7.5.1.3            Normal and periodic routing area updating procedure accepted by the network
If the routing area updating request has been accepted by the network, a ROUTING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT
message shall be sent to the MS. The network may assign a new P-TMSI and/or a new P-TMSI signature for the MS. If
a new P-TMSI and/or P-TMSI signature have been assigned to the MS, it/they shall be included in the ROUTING
AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message together with the routing area identification.

In a shared network, if the MS is a network sharing supporting MS, the network shall indicate the PLMN identity of the
CN operator that has accepted the routing area updating request in the RAI contained in the ROUTING AREA
UPDATE ACCEPT message; if the MS is a network sharing non-supporting MS, the network shall indicate the PLMN
identity of the common PLMN (see 3GPP TS 23.251 [109]). If the PLMN identity of the common PLMN included in
the RAI does not identify the CN operator that has accepted the routing area updating request, the network may include
the PLMN identity of the CN operator that has accepted the routing area updating request in the ROUTING AREA
UPDATE ACCEPT message.

In a multi-operator core network (MOCN) with common GERAN, the network shall indicate in the RAI the common
PLMN identity (see 3GPP TS 23.251 [109]). If the common PLMN identity included in the RAI does not identify the
CN operator that has accepted the routing area updating request, the network may include the PLMN identity of the CN
operator that has accepted the routing area updating request in the ROUTING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message.

In A/Gb mode, if the MS indicates support of integrity protection in the MS network capability IE in the ROUTING
AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, and if the network supports integrity protection, then the network shall store all
octets received from the MS in the MS network capability IE and in the MS Radio Access Capability IE, up to the
maximum length defined for the respective information element.

   NOTE 1: The network needs to store the MS network capability and MS Radio Access Capability exactly as
           received from the MS and network is not allowed to ignore the "higher" octets sent by the MS even if the
           network does not support any features indicated in the higher octetst. Otherwise the replay check of the
           MS network capability and MS Radio Access Capability will fail in the MS.

In A/Gb mode, if a UMTS security context is available in the network and if the MS indicates support of integrity
protection in the ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message and the network supports integrity protection, and if
integrity protection of the ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message is successfully verified in the LLC layer in
the network, then if the network decides to re-authenticate the MS or select a new integrity algorithm or ciphering
algorithm, the network shall initiate an authentication and ciphering procedure.

In A/Gb mode, if a UMTS security context is available in the network and if the MS indicates support of integrity
protection in the ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message and the network supports integrity protection if
integrity protection of the ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message is successfully verified in the LLC layer in
the network, the network may decide to continue using the stored GPRS GSM Kint integrity key, GPRS GSM Kc128
encryption key, GPRS GSM ciphering algorithm and GPRS GSM integrity algorithm in the LLC layer without
initiating an authentication and ciphering procedure. If the MS and network continue to use the same ciphering mode,
ciphering or no ciphering, the ciphering mode is re-established without the need to run an authentication and ciphering
procedure. The network shall replay the MS network capability IE and the MS radio access capability IE received from
the MS in the ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, by including the MS network capability IE and the MS
radio access capability IE in the ROUTING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message to the MS. The GMM layer in the
network shall assign the stored GPRS GSM Kint key, the GPRS GSM Kc128 key, the GPRS GSM integrity algorithm
and the GPRS GSM ciphering algorithm to the LLC layer. The MS shall then indicate to the LLC layer that it shall start
integrity protection and ciphering in the LLC layer before sending the ROUTING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message
to the MS. If the integrity protection of the ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message is not successfully
verified in the LLC layer or if the ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message is received without integrity
protection, then the network shall progress the routing area updating procedure and initiate an authentication and
ciphering procedure to authenticate the MS and activate integrity protection and ciphering in the MS.

In A/Gb mode, if a UMTS security context is available in the network and if the MS indicates support of integrity
protection in the ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message and the network supports integrity protection, and if
the network is not able to verify the message authentication code in the LLC layer protecting the ROUTING AREA
UPDATE REQUEST message, due to the LLC layer at the network not having been configured yet with the integrity
key and integrity algorithm for this MS, then the network shall progress the ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST
message at GMM layer anyway. If the CKSN included in the ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message belongs
to an UMTS security context available in the network, then the network may re-establish integrity protection and
ciphering of layer 3 signalling messages in the LLC layer without initiating an authentication and ciphering procedure.

In A/Gb mode, if the MS indicates support of integrity protection of user plane data in the MS network capability IE in
the ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, and if the network supports and accepts integrity protection of
user plane data, then the network shall indicate integrity protection of user plane data to the MS in the ROUTING
AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message. The MS shall indicate to the LLC layer to start integrity protection of user plane
data after the reception of the ROUTING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, if indicated. The same GPRS GSM Kint
key and the same GPRS GSM integrity algorithm used for integrity protection of layer 3 signalling messages shall be
used for integrity protection of user plane data in the LLC layer. The network shall indicate to the LLC layer to start
integrity protection of user plane data after sending the ROUTING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message to the MS. If
the network does not indicate to the MS in the ROUTING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message that it accepts the use of
integrity protection of user plane data, and if the MS does not accept such a network, then the MS shall detach from the
network.

If a new DRX parameter was included in the ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, the network shall store
the new DRX parameter and use it for the downlink transfer of signalling and user data.

The network shall include the extended DRX parameters IE in the ROUTING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message only
if the extended DRX parameters IE was included in the ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, and the
network supports and accepts the use of eDRX.

If the MS has indicated in the ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message that it supports PS inter-RAT handover
from GERAN to UTRAN Iu mode, the network may include in the ROUTING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message a
request to provide the Inter RAT information container.

If the MS has included the MS network capability IE or the UE network capability IE or both in the ROUTING AREA
UPDATE REQUEST message, the network shall store all octets received from the MS, up to the maximum length

defined for the respective information element. In case the UE network capability IE indicated new information to the
network, the MS shall set the TIN to "P-TMSI".

   NOTE 2: This information is forwarded to the new SGSN during inter-SGSN handover or to the new MME during
           intersystem handover to S1 mode.

In A/Gb mode the Cell Notification information element shall be included in the ROUTING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT
message in order to indicate the ability of the network to support the Cell Notification.

The network shall change to state GMM-COMMON-PROCEDURE-INITIATED and shall start the supervision timer
T3350 as described in subclause 4.7.6.

If the LAI or PLMN identity contained in the ROUTING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message is a member of any of
the "forbidden" lists and the MS is not attached for emergency bearer services, then any such entry shall be deleted.

In Iu mode, the network should prolong the PS signalling connection if the mobile station has indicated a follow-on
request pending in ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST. The network may also prolong the PS signalling
connection without any indication from the mobile terminal (for example, if user plane radio access bearers have been
established for the MS).

If the PDP context status information element is included in ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, then the
network shall deactivate all those PDP contexts locally (without peer to peer signalling between the MS and the
network), which are not in SM state PDP-INACTIVE on network side but are indicated by the MS as being in state
PDP-INACTIVE.

If the MBMS context status information element is included in the ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message,
then the network shall deactivate all those MBMS contexts locally (without peer to peer signalling between the MS and
network) which are not in SM state PDP-INACTIVE on the network side, but are indicated by the MS as being in state
PDP-INACTIVE. If no MBMS context status information element is included, then the network shall deactivate all
MBMS contexts locally which are not in SM state PDP-INACTIVE on the network side.

If a ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message is received from an MS with a LIPA PDN connection, and if:

   -   a L-GW Transport Layer Address is provided by the lower layer together with the ROUTING AREA UPDATE
       REQUEST message, and the GGSN address associated with the PDP context of the LIPA PDN connection is
       different from the provided L-GW Transport Layer Address (see 3GPP TS 25.413 [19c]); or

   -   no L-GW Transport Layer Address is provided together with the ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST
       message by the lower layer,

then the SGSN locally deactivates all PDP contexts associated with the LIPA PDN connection. If the ROUTING AREA
UPDATE REQUEST request message is accepted, the SGSN informs the MS via the PDP context status IE in the
ROUTING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message that PDP contexts were locally deactivated.

If a ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message is received from an MS with a SIPTO at the local network PDN
connection, the following different cases can be distinguished:

   1) If the PDN connection is a SIPTO at the local network PDN connection with collocated L-GW and if:

       -   a SIPTO L-GW Transport Layer Address is provided by the lower layer together with the ROUTING AREA
           UPDATE REQUEST message, and the GGSN address associated with the PDP context of the SIPTO at the
           local network PDN connection is different from the provided SIPTO L-GW Transport Layer Address (see
           3GPP TS 25.413 [19c]); or

       -   no SIPTO L-GW Transport Layer Address is provided together with the ROUTING AREA UPDATE
           REQUEST message by the lower layer,

   2) If the PDN connection is a SIPTO at the local network PDN connection with stand-alone GW and if:

       -   a LHN-ID value is provided by the lower layer together with the ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST
           message, and the LHN-ID stored in the PDP context of the SIPTO at the local network PDN connection is
           different from the provided LHN-ID value (see 3GPP TS 25.413 [19c]); or

       -   no LHN-ID value is provided together with the ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message by the

then the SGSN locally deactivates all PDP contexts associated with the SIPTO at the local network PDN connection. If
the ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST request message is accepted, the SGSN informs the MS via the PDP
context status IE in the ROUTING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message that PDP contexts were locally deactivated.

For a SIPTO at the local network PDN connection with stand-alone GW, the conditions to deactivate ISR are specified
in 3GPP TS 23.401 [122], subclause 4.3.5.6.

If due to regional subscription restrictions or access restrictions the MS is not allowed to access the routing area, but the
MS has a PDN connection for emergency bearer services established, the network may accept the ROUTING AREA
UPDATE REQUEST message and deactivate all non-emergency PDP contexts by initiating an PDP context
deactivation procedure when the routing area updating procedure is initiated in PMM-CONNECTED mode. When the
routing area updating procedure is initiated in PMM-IDLE mode, the network locally deactivates all non-emergency
PDP contexts and informs the MS via the PDP context status IE in the ROUTING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message.
The network shall not deactivate the PDP contexts for emergency bearer services. The network shall consider the MS to
be attached for emergency bearer services only.

If the network supports delivery of SMS via GPRS (see 3GPP TS 23.060 [74]) and this delivery is enabled (see
3GPP TS 29.272 [150]), then the network shall include the Additional network feature support IE in the ROUTING
AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message and set the GPRS-SMS indicator.

If the network supports the extended protocol configuration options IE and the MS indicated support of the extended
protocol configuration options IE, then the network shall include the Additional network feature support IE in the
ROUTING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message and set the ePCO IE indicator to "extended protocol configuration
options IE supported".

The network shall indicate "combined RA/LA updated" or "combined RA/LA updated and ISR activated" in the update
result IE in the ROUTING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, if the following conditions apply:

   -   the update type IE included in the ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message indicates "periodic
       updating" and the MS was previously successfully attached for GPRS and non-GPRS services; and

   -   location area updating for non-GPRS services as specified in 3GPP TS 29.018 [149] is successful.

The network shall include the T3324 value IE in the ROUTING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message only if the T3324
value IE was included in the ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, and the network supports and accepts
the use of PSM.

If the network supports and accepts the use of PSM, and the MS included the T3312 extended value IE in the
ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, then the network shall take into account the T3312 value requested
when providing the Periodic RA update timer IE and the T3312 extended value IE in the ROUTING AREA UPDATE
ACCEPT message.

   NOTE 3: Besides the value requested by the MS, the network can take local configuration into account when
           selecting a value for T3312 (see 3GPP TS 23.060 [74] subclause 5.3.13.54).

In A/Gb mode, if the MS indicates support for restriction on use of enhanced coverage in the ROUTING AREA
UPDATE REQUEST message, and the network restricts enhanced coverage for the MS, then the network shall set the
RestrictEC bit to "Enhanced coverage restricted" in the Additional network feature support IE of the ROUTING AREA
UPDATE ACCEPT message.

If the network includes the T3324 value IE indicating a value other than deactivated in the ROUTING AREA UPDATE
ACCEPT message, the network shall indicate in the Update result IE in the ROUTING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT
message that ISR is not activated.

Upon receipt of a ROUTING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, the MS shall store the received routing area
identification, stops timer T3330, reset the routing area updating attempt counter, reset the service request attempt
counter and set the GPRS update status to GU1 UPDATED. If the message contains a P-TMSI, the MS shall use this P-
TMSI as new temporary identity for GPRS services and shall store the new P-TMSI. If no P-TMSI was included by the
network in the ROUTING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, the old P-TMSI shall be kept. Furthermore, the MS
shall store the P-TMSI signature if received in the ROUTING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message. If no P-TMSI
signature was included in the message, the old P-TMSI signature, if available, shall be deleted.

Upon receipt of a ROUTING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message with update result IE indicating "combined RA/LA
updated" or "combined RA/LA updated and ISR activated" during the periodic routing area updating procedure, the MS
shall behave as follows:

   -   if the ROUTING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message contains an IMSI, the MS is not allocated any TMSI. The
       MS shall delete any old TMSI accordingly;

   -   if the ROUTING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message contains a TMSI, the MS shall use this TMSI as new
       temporary identity. The MS shall delete its old TMSI and shall store the new TMSI. In this case, a ROUTING
       AREA UPDATE COMPLETE message is returned to the network to confirm the received TMSI; or

   -   if neither a TMSI nor an IMSI has been included by the network in the ROUTING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT
       message, the old TMSI, if any is available, shall be kept.

Upon receiving a ROUTING AREA UPDATE COMPLETE message, the SGSN shall stop timer T3350 and change to
state GMM-REGISTERED. The P-TMSI, if sent in the ROUTING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, shall be
considered as valid.

   NOTE 4: Upon receiving a ROUTING AREA UPDATE COMPLETE message, if a new TMSI is included in the
           ROUTING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, the SGSN sends a BSSAP+-TMSI-REALLOCATION-
           COMPLETE message as specified in 3GPP TS 29.018 [149].

If the PDP context status information element is included in ROUTING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, then the
MS shall deactivate all those PDP contexts locally (without peer to peer signalling between the MS and network), which
are not in SM state PDP-INACTIVE in the MS but are indicated by the network as being in state PDP-INACTIVE. If
there is a default PDP context among the PDP contexts to be deactivated, an MS supporting S1 mode shall locally
deactivate all PDP contexts associated to the same PDP address and APN as the default PDP context without peer-to-
peer SM signalling to the network; an MS not supporting S1 mode may apply the same behaviour. If only the PDN
connection for emergency bearer services remains established, the MS shall consider itself attached for emergency
bearer services only.

If the MBMS context status information element is included in the ROUTING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message,
then the MS shall deactivate all those MBMS contexts locally (without peer to peer signalling between the MS and
network) which are not in SM state PDP-INACTIVE in the MS, but are indicated by the network as being in state PDP-
INACTIVE. If no MBMS context status information element is included, then the MS shall deactivate all those MBMS
contexts locally which are not in SM state PDP-INACTIVE in the MS.

If the ROUTING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message contains the T3312 extended value IE, then the MS shall use the
T3312 extended value IE as periodic routing area update timer (T3312). If the ROUTING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT
message does not contain the T3312 extended value IE, then the MS shall use value in the Periodic RA update timer IE
as periodic routing area update timer (T3312).

If the MS receives the ROUTING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message from a PLMN for which a PLMN-specific
attempt counter or PLMN-specific PS-attempt counter is maintained (see subclause 4.1.1.6A), then the MS shall reset
these counters. If the MS maintains a counter for "SIM/USIM considered invalid for GPRS services", then the MS shall
reset this counter.

If the ROUTING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message contains the T3324 value IE, then the MS shall use the timer
value for T3324 as specified in subclause 4.7.2.8.

If the ROUTING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message contains the DCN-ID IE, then the MS shall store the included
DCN-ID value together with the PLMN code of the registered PLMN in a DCN-ID list in a non-volatile memory in the
ME as described in 3GPP TS 24.301 [120], annex C.

In a shared network or in a multi-operator core network (MOCN) with common GERAN, if the ROUTING AREA
UPDATE ACCEPT message contains the DCN-ID IE and the PLMN identity of the CN operator IE, the MS shall store
the included DCN-ID value with the PLMN identity indicated in the PLMN identity of the CN operator IE, and the
included DCN-ID value with the PLMN identity indicated in the RAI in a DCN-ID list in a non-volatile memory in the
ME as described in 3GPP TS 24.301 [120], annex C.

In A/Gb mode, if the ROUTING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message contains the Cell Notification information
element, then the MS shall start to use the LLC NULL frame to perform cell updates.

If the MS has initiated the routing area updating procedure due to manual CSG selection and receives a ROUTING
AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, and the MS sent the ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message in a CSG
cell, the MS shall check if the CSG ID and associated PLMN identity of the cell are contained in the Allowed CSG list.
If not, the MS shall add that CSG ID and associated PLMN identity to the Allowed CSG list and the MS may add the

HNB Name (if provided by lower layers) to the Allowed CSG list if the HNB Name is present in neither the Operator
CSG list nor the Allowed CSG list.

The network may also send a list of "equivalent PLMNs" in the ROUTING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message. Each
entry of the list contains a PLMN code (MCC+MNC). If the routing area updating procedure is initiated during a CS
fallback procedure and the network is configured to support the return to the last registered E-UTRAN PLMN after CS
fallback as specified in 3GPP TS 23.272 [133], and the PLMN identity which is provided as part of the RAI contained
in the ROUTING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message differs from the last registered E-UTRAN PLMN identity, the
network shall include the last registered E-UTRAN PLMN identity in the list of "equivalent PLMNs" in the ROUTING
AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message.

   NOTE 5: The network can determine a routing area updating procedure is initiated during a CS fallback procedure
           as specified in 3GPP TS 23.272 [133].

   NOTE 6: The last registered E-UTRAN PLMN identity can be derived by the network as specified in
           3GPP TS 23.272 [133].

The mobile station shall store the list, as provided by the network, and further handle the list as follows:

   -   if there is no PDN connection for emergency bearers established, the mobile station shall remove from the list of
       "equivalent PLMNs" any PLMN code that is already in the "forbidden PLMN" list. If the mobile station is
       operating in MS operation mode C or the mobile station is supporting S1 mode, it shall also remove any PLMN
       code that is already in the list of "forbidden PLMNs for GPRS service";

   -   if the MS is not attached for emergency bearer services and there is a PDN connection for emergency bearer
       services established, the MS shall remove from the list of "equivalent PLMNs" any PLMN code present in the
       "forbidden PLMN" list when the PDN connection for emergency bearer services is released. If the mobile station
       is operating in MS operation mode C or the mobile station is supporting S1 mode, it shall also remove any
       PLMN code present in the list of "forbidden PLMNs for GPRS service" when the PDN connection for
       emergency bearer services is released; and

   -   in addition, for all cases the mobile station shall add to the stored list the PLMN code of the registered PLMN
       that sent the list.

All PLMNs in the stored list shall be regarded as equivalent to each other for PLMN selection, cell selection/re-
selection and handover. The stored list in the mobile station shall be replaced on each occurrence of the ROUTING
AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message. If no list is contained in the message, then the stored list in the mobile station shall
be deleted. An MS attached for emergency bearer services only shall delete the stored list when the MS enters the state
GMM-DEREGISTERED. The list shall be stored in the mobile station while switched off so that it can be used for
PLMN selection after switch on.

A ROUTING AREA UPDATE COMPLETE message shall be returned to the network if the ROUTING AREA
UPDATE ACCEPT message contained any of:

   -   a P-TMSI;

   -   a TMSI;

   -   receive N-PDU Numbers (see 3GPP TS 44.065 [78] and 3GPP TS 25.322 [19b]); or

   -   a request for the provision of Inter RAT handover information.

If Receive N-PDU Numbers were included, the Receive N-PDU Numbers values valid in the MS, shall be included in
the ROUTING AREA UPDATE COMPLETE message.

If the network has requested the provision of Inter RAT handover information, the MS shall return a ROUTING AREA
UPDATE COMPLETE message including the Inter RAT handover information IE to the network.

   NOTE 7: In Iu mode, after a routing area updating procedure, the mobile station can initiate Service Request
           procedure to request the resource reservation for the active PDP contexts if the resources have been
           released by the network or send upper layer message (e.g. ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST) to
           the network via the existing PS signalling connection.

In Iu mode, if the network wishes to prolong the PS signalling connection (for example, if the mobile station has
indicated "follow-on request pending" in ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message or if user plane radio access

bearers have been established for the MS) the network shall indicate the "follow-on proceed" in the ROUTING AREA
UPDATE ACCEPT message. If the network wishes to release the PS signalling connection, the network shall indicate
"no follow-on proceed" in the ROUTING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message.

After that in Iu mode, the mobile station shall act according to the follow-on proceed flag included in the Update result
information element in the ROUTING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message (see subclause 4.7.13).

The network may also send a Local Emergency Numbers List with local emergency numbers in the ROUTING AREA
UPDATE ACCEPT, by including the Emergency Number List IE. The mobile equipment shall store the Local
Emergency Numbers List, as provided by the network. The Local Emergency Numbers List stored in the mobile
equipment shall be replaced on each receipt of the Emergency Number List IE. The received Local Emergency
Numbers List shall be provided to the upper layers.

The emergency number(s) received in the Emergency Number List IE are valid only in networks in the same country as
the cell on which this IE is received. If no list is contained in the ROUTING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, then
the stored Local Emergency Numbers List in the mobile equipment shall be kept, except if the mobile equipment has
successfully registered to a PLMN in a country different from that of the PLMN that sent the Local Emergency
Numbers List.

The mobile equipment shall use the stored Local Emergency Numbers List of emergency numbers received from the
network in addition to the emergency numbers stored on the SIM/USIM or ME to detect that the number dialled is an
emergency number.

   NOTE 8: The mobile equipment may use the Local Emergency Numbers List to assist the end user in determining
           whether the dialled number is intended for an emergency service or for another destination, e.g. a local
           directory service. The possible interactions with the end user are implementation specific.

   NOTE 9: An MS that supports procedures specified in 3GPP TS 24.302 [156], can get additional local emergency
           numbers through those procedures, which can be used based on operator policy (see
           3GPP TS 24.302 [156]) to detect that the number dialled is an emergency number.

The Local Emergency Numbers List shall be deleted at switch off and removal of the SIM/USIM. The mobile
equipment shall be able to store up to ten local emergency numbers received from the network.

In order to indicate to the MS that the GUTI and TAI list assigned to the MS remain registered with the network and are
valid in the MS, the network shall indicate in the Update result IE in the ROUTING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT
message that ISR is activated.

If the MS is attached for emergency bearer services or if the network has deactivated all non-emergency PDP contexts,
the network shall indicate in the update result IE in the ROUTING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message that ISR is not
activated.

If the ROUTING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message contains:

   i) no indication that ISR is activated, an MS supporting S1 mode shall set the TIN to "P-TMSI" and shall stop the
      periodic tracking area update timer T3412 or T3423, if running; or

   ii) an indication that ISR is activated, then:

       -   if the MS is required to perform tracking area updating for IMS voice termination as specified in annex P.5,
           the MS shall set the TIN to "P-TMSI" and shall stop the periodic tracking area update timer T3412 or T3423,
           if running;

       -   if the MS had initiated the routing area updating procedure due to a change in DRX parameters, the MS shall
           set the TIN to "P-TMSI" and shall stop the periodic tracking area update timer T3412 or T3423 if running;

       -   if the MS had initiated the routing area updating procedure due to a change in the UE's usage setting or the
           voice domain preference for E-UTRAN, the MS shall set the TIN to "P-TMSI" and shall stop the periodic
           tracking area update timer T3412 or T3423, if running; or

       -   the MS shall regard the available GUTI and TAI list as valid and registered with the network. If the TIN
           currently indicates "GUTI" and the periodic tracking area update timer T3412 is running or is deactivated, the
           MS shall set the TIN to "RAT-related TMSI". If the TIN currently indicates "GUTI" and the periodic
           tracking area update timer T3412 has already expired, the MS shall set the TIN to "P-TMSI".

In A/Gb mode, if a UMTS security context is available, if the MS indicates support of integrity protection in the
ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message and the network supports integrity protection, then if the MS receives
replayed capability IE’s in ROUTING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, then the MS shall check if the replayed MS
network capability IE and the replayed MS Radio Access Capability IE received in the ROUTING AREA UPDATE
ACCEPT message has not been altered compared to the MS network capability IE and the MS Radio Access Capability
IE that the MS sent to the network in ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message. If the replayed MS network
capability IE and the replayed MS Radio Access Capability IE are not the same, then the MS shall ignore the
ROUTING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message.

4.7.5.1.4            Normal and periodic routing area updating procedure not accepted by the
                     network
If the routing area updating cannot be accepted, the network sends a ROUTING AREA UPDATE REJECT message to
the MS. An MS, which receives a ROUTING AREA UPDATE REJECT message with a reject cause other than GMM
cause value #25 or the message is integrity protected, shall stop the timer T3330. If a ROUTING AREA UPDATE
REJECT message containing a reject cause other than GMM cause value #25 is received or the message is integrity
protected, the MS shall stop any ongoing transmission of user data.

If the ROUTING AREA UPDATE REJECT message containing GMM cause value cause #25 was received without
integrity protection, then the MS shall discard the message.

If the routing area update request is rejected due to general NAS level mobility management congestion control, the
network shall set the GMM cause value to #22 "congestion" and assign a back-off timer T3346.

The MS shall then take different actions depending on the received reject cause value:

   #3      (Illegal MS);

   #6      (Illegal ME);

        The MS shall set the GPRS update status to GU3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED (and shall store it according to
        subclause 4.1.3.2) and shall delete any P-TMSI, P-TMSI signature, RAI and GPRS ciphering key sequence
        number. The MS shall consider the SIM/USIM as invalid for GPRS services until switching off or the
        SIM/USIM is removed. If the message has been successfully integrity checked by the lower layers and the MS
        maintains a counter for "SIM/USIM considered invalid for GPRS services", then the MS shall set this counter to
        MS implementation-specific maximum value. The MS shall delete the list of equivalent PLMNs, and shall enter
        the state GMM-DEREGISTERED.

        If the MS is IMSI attached, the MS shall in addition set the update status to U3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED,
        shall delete any TMSI, LAI and ciphering key sequence number. If the MS is operating in MS operation mode A
        and an RR connection exists, the MS shall abort the RR connection, unless an emergency call is ongoing. The
        SIM/USIM shall be considered as invalid also for non-GPRS services until switching off or the SIM/USIM is
        removed or the timer T3245 expires as described in subclause 4.1.1.6. If the MS maintains a counter for
        "SIM/USIM considered invalid for non-GPRS services", then the MS shall set this counter to MS
        implementation-specific maximum value.

        If S1 mode is supported in the MS, the MS shall handle the EMM parameters EMM state, EPS update status,
        GUTI, last visited registered TAI, TAI list and KSI as specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 [120] for the case when the
        tracking area update procedure is rejected with the EMM cause with the same value.

   NOTE 1: The possibility to configure a MS so that the radio transceiver for a specific radio access technology is not
           active, although it is implemented in the MS, is out of scope of the present specification.

   #7      (GPRS services not allowed);

        The MS shall set the GPRS update status to GU3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED (and shall store it according to
        subclause 4.1.3.2.9) and shall delete any P-TMSI, P-TMSI signature, RAI and GPRS ciphering key sequence
        number. The SIM/USIM shall be considered as invalid for GPRS services until switching off or the SIM/USIM
        is removed. The MS shall delete the list of equivalent PLMNs, and shall enter the state GMM-
        DEREGISTERED. If the message has been successfully integrity checked by the lower layers and the MS
        maintains a counter for "SIM/USIM considered invalid for GPRS services", then the MS shall set this counter to
        MS implementation-specific maximum value.

      mode I, is IMSI detached for both GPRS and CS services in the network.

      A GPRS MS operating in MS operation mode A in network operation mode I is detached for GPRS services. If
      no RR connection exists then the MS is also IMSI detached for the CS services.

      The MS shall enter the state GMM-DEREGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE. If the rejected request was not for
      initiating a PDN connection for emergency bearer services, then

      -   a GPRS MS operating in MS operation mode A or B in network operation mode II which is configured to use
          CS fallback and SMS over SGs, or SMS over SGs only, and which did not perform a successful generic
          location updating procedure since the last intersystem change from S1 mode to A/Gb or Iu mode shall
          proceed with appropriate MM specific procedures;

      -   regardless of the MS operation mode and the network operation mode, the MS shall then perform a new
          attach procedure. The MS should also activate PDP context(s) that were originally activated by the MS to
          replace any previously MS activated PDP context(s). The MS should also perform the procedures needed in
          order to activate any previously active multicast service(s); and

      -   additionally, a GPRS MS operating in MS operation mode A in network operation mode I which is
          configured to use CS fallback and SMS over SGs, or SMS over SGs only, and which is in an ongoing circuit-
          switched transaction shall initiate the appropriate MM specific procedure after the circuit-switched
          transaction has been released. The MM sublayer shall act as in network operation mode II as long as the
          combined GMM procedures are not successful and no new RA is entered.

      If S1 mode is supported in the MS, the MS shall handle the EMM state as specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 [120] for
      the case when the tracking area update procedure is rejected with the EMM cause with the same value.

   NOTE 4: In some cases, user interaction may be required and then the MS cannot activate the PDP and MBMS
           context(s) automatically.

   # 11   (PLMN not allowed);

      The MS shall delete any RAI, P-TMSI, P-TMSI signature and GPRS ciphering key sequence number, shall set
      the GPRS update status to GU3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED (and shall store it according to subclause 4.1.3.2),
      shall reset the routing area updating attempt counter, shall delete the list of equivalent PLMNs, and enter the
      state GMM-DEREGISTERED.

      The MS shall store the PLMN identity in the "forbidden PLMN list" and if the MS is configured to use timer
      T3245 (see 3GPP TS 24.368 [135] or 3GPP TS 31.102 [112]) then the MS shall start timer T3245 and proceed
      as described in subclause 4.1.1.6. If the message has been successfully integrity checked by the lower layers and
      the MS maintains a PLMN-specific attempt counter for that PLMN, then the MS shall set this counter to the MS
      implementation-specific maximum value.

      The MS shall start timer T3340 as described in subclause 4.7.1.9.

      If no RR connection exists, the MS shall perform the following additional actions immediately. If the MS is
      operating in MS operation mode A and an RR connection exists, the MS shall perform these actions when the
      RR connection is subsequently released:

      -   If the MS is IMSI attached, the MS shall set the update status to U3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED and shall
          delete any TMSI, LAI and ciphering key sequence number and shall reset the location update attempt
          counter. The new MM state is MM IDLE.

      -   The MS shall perform a PLMN selection according to 3GPP TS 23.122 [14].

by the network, the MS shall perform the procedures as described in subclause 4.7.5.1.4. Then if the MS is in the same
selected PLMN where the last routing area updating was attempted, the MS shall:

   a) inform the upper layers of the failure of the procedure; or

   NOTE 1: This can result in the upper layers requesting establishment of a CS emergency call (if not already

   b) detach locally, if not detached already, attempt GPRS attach for emergency bearer services.

If the routing area updating request for initiating a PDN connection for emergency bearer services fails due to abnormal
case a) in subclause 4.7.5.1.5, the MS shall perform the procedures as described in subclause 4.7.5.1.5 and inform the
upper layers of the failure to access the network.

   NOTE 2: This can result in the upper layers requesting establishment of a CS emergency call (if not already

4.7.5.1.5            Abnormal cases in the MS
The following abnormal cases can be identified:

   a) Access barred because of access class control, EAB or ACDC

       If the routing area updating procedure is started in response to a paging request from the network, access class
       barring, EAB or ACDC is not applicable.

       The routing area updating procedure shall not be started. The MS stays in the current serving cell and applies the
       normal cell reselection process. The procedure is started as soon as possible and if still necessary, i.e. when the
       barred state is removed or because of a cell change.

       If access is barred because of access class control, the upper layers request PS signalling connection, ACDC is
       applicable to the request and the MS supports ACDC, then the routing area updating procedure shall be started
       according to subclause 4.7.5.1.1.

       If access is barred for a certain ACDC category, and if the upper layers request PS signalling connection for a
       higher ACDC category and the MS supports ACDC, then the routing area updating procedure shall be started
       according to subclause 4.7.5.1.1.

       If an access request for an uncategorized application is barred due to ACDC , and if the upper layers request PS
       signalling connection for a certain ACDC category and the MS supports ACDC, then the routing area updating
       procedure shall be started according to subclause 4.7.5.1.1.

   b) Lower layer failure without "Extended Wait Time" received from lower layers before the ROUTING AREA
      UPDATE ACCEPT or ROUTING AREA UPDATE REJECT message is received

      The procedure shall be aborted and the MS shall proceed as described below, except in the following
      implementation option cases b.1 and b.2.

   b.1)   Release of PS signalling connection before the completion of the routing area updating procedure

      The routing area updating procedure shall be initiated again, if the following conditions apply:

          i) The original routing area update procedure was initiated over an existing PS signalling connection; and

          ii) The routing area update procedure was not due to timer T3330 expiry; and

          iii) No SECURITY MODE COMMAND message and no Non-Access Stratum (NAS) messages relating to
          the PS signalling connection were (e.g. PS authentication procedure, see subclause 4.7.7) received after the
          ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message was transmitted.

   b.2) RR release in Iu mode (i.e. RRC connection release) with, for example, cause "Normal", or "User inactivity"
       or "Direct signalling connection re-establishment" (see 3GPP TS 25.331 [23c] and 3GPP TS 44.118 [111])

      The routing area updating procedure shall be initiated again, if the following conditions apply:

          i) The original routing area update procedure was initiated over an existing RRC connection; and

          ii) The routing area update procedure was not due to timer T3330 expiry; and

          iii) No SECURITY MODE COMMAND message and no Non-Access Stratum (NAS) messages relating to
          the PS signalling connection (e.g. PS authentication procedure, see subclause 4.7.7) were received after the
          ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message was transmitted.

   NOTE 1: The RRC connection release cause that triggers the re-initiation of the routing area update procedure is
           implementation specific.

   c) T3330 time-out

      The procedure is restarted four times, i.e. on the fifth expiry of timer T3330, the MS shall abort the procedure
      and, in Iu mode, release the PS signalling connection (see 3GPP TS 25.331 [23c]). The MS shall proceed as
      described below.

   d) ROUTING AREA UPDATE REJECT, other causes than those treated in subclause 4.7.5.1.4, and cases of GMM
      cause values #22 and #25, if considered as abnormal cases according to subclause 4.7.5.1.4

      If the routing area updating request is not for initiating a PDN connection for emergency bearer services, upon
      reception of the cause codes # 95, # 96, # 97, # 99 and # 111 the MS should set the routing area updating attempt
      counter to 5.

      The MS shall proceed as described below.

   e) If a routing area border is crossed, when the MS is in state GMM-ROUTING-AREA-UPDATE-INITIATED, the
      routing area updating procedure shall be aborted and re-initiated immediately. The MS shall set the GPRS update
      status to GU2 NOT UPDATED.

   f) In A/Gb mode, if a cell change occurs within the same RA, when the MS is in state GMM-ROUTING-AREA-
      UPDATE-INITIATED, the cell update procedure is performed, before completion of the routing area updating
      procedure.

   g) Routing area updating and detach procedure collision

      GPRS detach containing detach type "re-attach required" or "re-attach not required":

          If the MS receives a DETACH REQUEST message before the routing area updating procedure has been
          completed, the routing area updating procedure shall be aborted and the GPRS detach procedure shall be
          progressed. If the DETACH REQUEST message contains detach type "re-attach not required" and GMM
          cause #2 "IMSI unknown in HLR", the MS will follow the procedure as described below for the detach type
          "IMSI detach".




                                                         ETSI
3GPP TS 24.008 version 15.8.0 Release 15                  212                        ETSI TS 124 008 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


      GPRS detach containing detach type "IMSI detach":

          If the MS receives a DETACH REQUEST message before the routing area updating procedure has been
          completed, the routing area updating procedure shall be progressed, i.e. the DETACH REQUEST message
          shall be ignored.

      The MS shall proceed as described below.

   h) Routing area updating and P-TMSI reallocation procedure collision

      If the MS receives a P-TMSI REALLOCATION C0MMAND message before the routing area updating
      procedure has been completed, the P-TMSI reallocation procedure shall be aborted and the routing area updating
      procedure shall be progressed.

   i) "Extended wait time" for PS domain from the lower layers

      If the ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message contained the low priority indicator set to "MS is
      configured for NAS signalling low priority", the MS shall start timer T3346 with the "Extended wait time" value
      and reset the routing area updating attempt counter.

      In other cases the MS shall ignore the "Extended wait time".

      The MS shall abort the routing area updating procedure, stay in the current serving cell, set the GPRS update
      status to GU2 NOT UPDATED, change the state to GMM-REGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-UPDATE and
      apply the normal cell reselection process.

      If the MS had used eDRX before initiating routing area updating procedure, then the MS shall continue to use
      the eDRX with the extended DRX parameters IE received during the last attach or routing area updating
      procedure.

      The MS shall proceed as described below.

   j) Timer T3346 is running

      The MS shall not start the routing area updating procedure unless:

      -   the MS is an MS configured to use AC11 – 15 in selected PLMN;

      -   the MS is in PMM-CONNECTED mode (Iu mode);

      -   the MS receives a paging;

      -   the MS has a PDN connection for emergency bearer services established;

      -   the MS is establishing a PDN connection for emergency bearer services; or

      -   the MS has a PDN connection established without the NAS signalling low priority indication or is
          establishing a PDN connection without the NAS signalling low priority indication and if the timer T3346 was
          started due to rejection of a NAS request message (e.g. ATTACH REQUEST, ROUTING AREA UPDATE
          REQUEST or SERVICE REQUEST) which contained the low priority indicator set to "MS is configured for
          NAS signalling low priority".

      The MS stays in the current serving cell and applies the normal cell reselection process.

   NOTE 2: It is considered an abnormal case if the MS needs to initiate an routing area updating procedure while
           timer T3346 is running independent on whether timer T3346 was started due to an abnormal case or a non
           successful case.

      If the stored RAI is different to the RAI of the current serving cell or the TIN indicates "GUTI", the MS shall set
      the GPRS update status to GU2 NOT UPDATED and change to state GMM-REGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-
      TO-UPDATE.

      The MS shall proceed as described below.

   k) Mobile originated detach required

      GPRS detach due to removal of the USIM or due to switch off:



                                                         ETSI
3GPP TS 24.008 version 15.8.0 Release 15                     213                       ETSI TS 124 008 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


           If the MS is in the state GMM-ROUTING-AREA-UPDATE-INITIATED, the routing area updating
           procedure shall be aborted and the GPRS detach procedure shall be performed (see subclause 4.7.4.1).

       GPRS detach not due to removal of the USIM and not due to switch off:

           The MS shall initiate the MS initiated detach procedure after successful completion of the routing area
           updating procedure.

   l) Routing area updating and paging for non-GPRS services procedure collision

       If a GPRS MS in MS operation mode B receives a paging for non-GPRS services before the normal or periodic
       routing area updating procedure has been completed, the MS shall progress the routing area updating procedure
       and respond to the paging for non-GPRS services when it has completed the routing area updating procedure or
       aborted the procedure for other reasons.

In cases b, c, d, e, g with detach type "re-attach required" or "re-attach not required" with GMM cause other than #2
"IMSI unknown in HLR", and i, the MS shall stop any ongoing transmission of user data.

In cases b, c, d, i and j the MS shall proceed as follows:

       Timer T3330 shall be stopped if still running.

       For the cases b, c, d, and i when the "Extended wait time" is ignored, if the routing area updating request is not
       for initiating a PDN connection for emergency bearer services, the routing area updating attempt counter shall be
       incremented.

       If the routing area updating attempt counter is less than 5, and the stored RAI is equal to the RAI of the current
       serving cell and the GPRS update status is equal to GU1 UPDATED and the TIN does not indicate "GUTI":

       -   the MS shall keep the GPRS update status to GU1 UPDATED and changes state to GMM-
           REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE. The MS shall start timer T3311.

       -   If in addition the ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message indicated "periodic updating", none of
           the other reasons for initiating the routing area updating procedure listed in subclause 4.7.5.1 was applicable,
           and the ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message did not include a Requested READY timer value
           IE, T3324 value IE, T3312 extended value IE or Extended DRX parameters IE,

           -   in Iu mode, the timer T3311 may be stopped when the MS enters PMM-CONNECTED mode;

           -   in A/Gb mode, the timer T3311 may be stopped when the READY timer is started.

       -   If timer T3311 expires the routing area updating procedure is triggered again.

       If the routing area updating attempt counter is less than 5, and the stored RAI is different to the RAI of the
       current serving cell or the GPRS update status is different to GU1 UPDATED or the TIN indicates "GUTI":

       -   for the cases i and j, the routing area updating procedure is started, if still necessary, when timer T3346
           expires or is stopped.

       -   for the cases b, c, d, and i when the "Extended wait time" is ignored, if the routing area updating request is
           not for initiating a PDN connection for emergency bearer services, the MS shall start timer T3311, shall set
           the GPRS update status to GU2 NOT UPDATED and changes state to GMM-
           REGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-UPDATE.

       -   If S1 mode is supported by the MS, the MS shall in addition handle the EPS update status as specified in
           3GPP TS 24.301 [120] for the abnormal case when a normal or periodic tracking area updating procedure
           fails and the tracking area updating attempt counter is less than 5 and the EPS update status is different from
           EU1 UPDATED.

       If the routing area updating attempt counter is greater than or equal to 5:

       -   the MS shall start timer T3302, and shall set the GPRS update status to GU2 NOT UPDATED. An MS which
           is a GPRS MS in MS operation modes C shall also delete the list of equivalent PLMNs. The MS shall also
           enter the state GMM-REGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-UPDATE or optionally the GMM-
           REGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH state (see subclause 4.2.5.1.8) in order to perform a PLMN selection
           according to 3GPP TS 23.122 [14].



                                                             ETSI
3GPP TS 24.008 version 15.8.0 Release 15                  214                       ETSI TS 124 008 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


      -   If S1 mode is supported by the MS, the MS shall in addition handle the EPS update status as specified in
          3GPP TS 24.301 [120] for the abnormal case when a normal or periodic tracking area updating procedure
          fails and the tracking area updating attempt counter is equal to 5.

      -   If the MS does not enter the state GMM-REGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH, then

          -   a GPRS MS operating in MS operation mode A in network operation mode I shall proceed with
              appropriate MM specific procedures. If the MS operating in MS operation mode A is in an ongoing
              circuit-switched transaction, it shall initiate the appropriate MM specific procedure after the circuit-
              switched transaction has been released. The MM sublayer of the MS operating in MS operation mode A
              shall act as in network operation mode II as long as the combined GMM procedures are not successful
              and no new RA is entered;

          -   if the update type is "periodic updating", a GPRS MS operating in MS operation mode B in network
              operation mode I shall proceed with appropriate MM specific procedures. The MM sublayer shall act as
              in network operation mode II as long as the combined GMM procedures are not successful and no new
              RA is entered; and

          -   a GPRS MS operating in MS operation mode A or B in network operation mode II which is configured to
              use CS fallback and SMS over SGs, or SMS over SGs only, and which did not perform a successful
              generic location updating procedure since the last intersystem change from S1 mode to A/Gb or Iu mode
              shall proceed with appropriate MM specific procedures.

4.7.5.1.6              Abnormal cases on the network side
   The following abnormal cases can be identified:

   a) If a lower layer failure occurs before the message ROUTING AREA UPDATE COMPLETE has been received
      from the MS and a P-TMSI and/or PTMSI signature has been assigned, the network shall abort the procedure
      and shall consider both, the old and new P-TMSI and the corresponding P-TMSI signatures as valid until the old
      P-TMSI can be considered as invalid by the network (see subclause 4.7.1.5). During this period the network may
      use the identification procedure followed by a P-TMSI reallocation procedure if the old P-TMSI is used by the
      MS in a subsequent message.

   NOTE 1: Optionally, paging with IMSI may be used if paging with old and new P-TMSI fails. Paging with IMSI
           causes the MS to re-attach as described in subclause 4.7.9.1.

   b) Protocol error

      If the ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message has been received with a protocol error, the network
      shall return a ROUTING AREA UPDATE REJECT message with one of the following reject causes:

      #96:    Mandatory information element error;

      #99:    Information element non-existent or not implemented;

      #100: Conditional IE error;

      #111: Protocol error, unspecified.

   c) T3350 time-out

      On the first expiry of the timer, the network shall retransmit the ROUTING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message
      and shall reset and restart timer T3350. The retransmission is performed four times, i.e. on the fifth expiry of
      timer T3350, the routing area updating procedure is aborted. Both, the old and the new P-TMSI and the

       corresponding P-TMSI signatures shall be considered as valid until the old P-TMSI can be considered as invalid
       by the network(see subclause 4.7.1.5). During this period the network acts as described for case a above.

   d.1) ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST received after the ROUTING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message
       has been sent and before the ROUTING AREA UPDATE COMPLETE message is received

   -   If one or more of the information elements in the ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message differ from
       the ones received within the previous ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, the previously initiated
       routing area updating procedure shall be aborted if the ROUTING AREA UPDATE COMPLETE message has
       not been received and the new routing area updating procedure shall be progressed, or

   -   If the information elements do not differ, then the ROUTING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message shall be
       resent and the timer T3350 shall be restarted if an ROUTING AREA UPDATE COMPLETE message is
       expected. In that case, the retransmission counter related to T3350 is not incremented.

   d.2) More than one ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST received and no ROUTING AREA UPDATE
       ACCEPT or ROUTING AREA UPDATE REJECT message has been sent

   -   If one or more of the information elements in the ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message differs from
       the ones received within the previous ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, the previously initiated
       routing area updating procedure shall be aborted and the new routing area updating procedure shall be
       progressed;

   -   If the information elements do not differ, then the network shall continue with the previous routing area updating
       procedure and shall not treat any further this ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message.

   e) DETACH REQUEST message received before the ROUTING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message is sent or
      before the ROUTING AREA UPDATE COMPLETE message (in case of P-TMSI and/or TMSI was allocated)
      is received.

       GPRS detach containing cause "power off":

       The network shall abort the signalling for the routing area updating procedure towards the MS and shall progress
       the detach procedure as described in subclause 4.7.4.1.

   NOTE 2: Internally in the network, before processing the detach request, the SGSN can perform the necessary
           signalling procedures for the routing area updating procedure before progressing the detach procedure.

       GPRS detach containing other causes than "power off":

          The network shall proceed with the routing area updating procedure and shall progress the detach procedure
          after successful completion of the routing area updating procedure.

   f) ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message with update type IE indicating "periodic updating" is received
      by the network, the network does not have the GMM context data related to the subscription, and the network
      operates in network operation mode I.

       The network may send the ROUTING AREA UPDATE REJECT message with GMM cause value #10

4.7.5.2          Combined routing area updating procedure

4.7.5.2.0            General
Within a combined routing area updating procedure the messages ROUTING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT and
ROUTING AREA UPDATE COMPLETE carry information for the routing area updating and the location area
updating.

4.7.5.2.1            Combined routing area updating procedure initiation
The combined routing area updating procedure is initiated only by a GPRS MS operating in MS operation modes A or
B, if the MS is in state GMM-REGISTERED and MM-IDLE, and if the network operates in network operation mode I:

   -   when a GPRS MS that is IMSI attached for GPRS and non-GPRS services detects a change of the routing area in
       state GMM-REGISTERED and MM-IDLE, unless the MS is configured for "AttachWithIMSI" as specified in
       3GPP TS 24.368 [135] or 3GPP TS 31.102 [112] and is entering a routing area in a new PLMN that is neither
       the registered PLMN nor in the list of equivalent PLMNs;

   -   when a GPRS MS that is IMSI attached for GPRS services wants to perform an IMSI attach for non-GPRS
       services;

   -   after termination of a non-GPRS service via non-GPRS channels to update the association if the MS has changed
       the RA during that non-GPRS service transaction;

   -   after termination of a non-GPRS service via non-GPRS channels to update the association if GPRS services were
       suspended during the non-GPRS service but no resume is received. See 3GPP TS 23.060 [74] subclause 16.2.1;

   -   after termination of a non-GPRS service via non-GPRS channels to update the association, if the GPRS MS in
       MS operation mode A performed a normal GPRS attach or a normal routing area updating procedure during the
       circuit-switched transaction;

   -   after a CM SERVICE REJECT message with cause value #4 is received by the mobile station (see
       subclause 4.5.1.1); in this case the update type IE shall be set to "Combined RA/LA updating with IMSI attach";

   -   when a GPRS MS needs to update the network with the new MS Radio Access Capability IE;

   -   when a GPRS MS needs to update the network with a new DRX parameter IE;

   -   in Iu mode, to re-synchronize the PMM mode of MS and network after RRC connection release with cause
       "Directed signalling connection re-establishment", see subclause 4.7.2.5;

   -   in Iu mode, to re-synchronize the PMM mode of MS and network after inter-system change not due to PS
       handover from PMM-CONNECTED mode in Iu mode to A/Gb mode or S1 mode, if the MS performed an inter -
       system change back to Iu mode without sending a ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message while in
       A/Gb mode or a TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message while in S1 mode;

   -   in Iu mode and A/Gb mode, after intersystem change from S1 mode, and the GMM receives an indication of
       "RRC connection failure" from lower layers due to lower layer failure while in S1 mode. In this case, if the TIN
       indicates "RAT-related TMSI", the MS shall set the TIN to "GUTI" before initiating the routing area updating
       procedure;

   -   in A/Gb mode, after intersystem change from S1 mode if the TIN indicates "RAT-related TMSI", but the MS is
       required to perform routing area updating for IMS voice termination as specified in annex P.4;

   -   when the MS enters GMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE and the TIN indicates "GUTI";

   -   when the MS supports SRVCC and changes the mobile station classmark 2, mobile station classmark 3 or the
       supported codecs;

   -   when the MS which is configured to use CS fallback and SMS over SGs, or SMS over SGs only, enters a
       GERAN or UTRAN cell and timer T3423 has expired, or is in the GERAN or UTRAN cell when timer T3423
       expires;

   -   when due to a manual CSG selection the GPRS MS has selected a CSG cell whose CSG identity and associated
       PLMN identity are not included in the MS's Allowed CSG list or in the MS's Operator CSG list;

   -   when the MS changes the MS network capability information;

   -   when the UE's usage setting or the voice domain preference for E-UTRAN change in the MS;

   -   when the MS activates mobility management for IMS voice termination as specified in annex P.2 and the TIN
       indicates "RAT-related TMSI";

   -   upon reception of a paging indication using P-TMSI, if the timer T3346 is running and the MS is in state GMM-
       REGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-UPDATE and the RAI of the current cell is same as the stored RAI;

   -   when the MS which is configured to use CS fallback and SMS over SGs, or SMS over SGs only, enters a
       GERAN or UTRAN cell, after intersystem change from S1 mode to Iu or A/Gb mode not due to CS fallback,
       and the location area of the current cell is different from the location area stored in the MS;

   -   in A/Gb mode, after intersystem change from S1 mode via cell change order procedure not due to CS fallback, if
       the TIN indicates "RAT-related TMSI"; in this case the MS shall set the TIN to "GUTI" before initiating the
       combined routing area updating procedure;

   -   in A/Gb mode, after Inter RAT handover from S1 mode or Iu mode;

   -   when the MS needs to request the use of PSM or needs to stop the use of PSM;

   -   when the MS needs to request the use of eDRX or needs to stop the use of eDRX;

   -   when a change in the eDRX usage conditions at the MS requires different extended DRX parameters;

   -   when a change in the PSM usage conditions at the MS requires a different timer T3312 value or different timer
       T3324 value; or

   NOTE 1: A change in the PSM or eDRX usage conditions at the MS can include e.g. a change in the MS
           configuration, a change in requirements from upper layers or the battery running low at the MS.

   -   when the Default_DCN_ID value changes, as specified in 3GPP TS 24.368 [135] or in USIM file NASCONFIG as
       specified in 3GPP TS 31.102 [112].

   NOTE 2: The routing area updating procedure is initiated after deleting the DCN-ID list as specified in
           3GPP TS 24.301 [120], annex C.

In A/Gb mode, the routing and location area identification are broadcast on the broadcast channel(s). A combined
routing area updating procedure shall abort any ongoing GMM procedure. Aborted GMM procedures shall be repeated
after the combined routing area updating procedure has been successfully performed. The ROUTING AREA UPDATE
REQUEST message shall always be the first message sent from the MS in the new routing area after routing area
change.

In Iu mode, the routing and location area identification are broadcast on the broadcast channel(s) or sent to the MS via
the PS signalling connection. A combined routing area updating procedure shall abort any ongoing GMM procedure.
Aborted GMM procedures may be repeated after the combined routing area updating procedure has been successfully
performed. The ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message shall always be the first GMM message sent from the
MS in the new routing area after routing area change.

To initiate a combined routing area updating procedure the MS sends the message ROUTING AREA UPDATE
REQUEST to the network, starts timer T3330 and changes to state GMM-ROUTING-UPDATING-INITIATED and
MM LOCATION UPDATING PENDING. The value of the Update type IE in the message shall indicate "combined
RA/LA updating" unless explicitly specified otherwise. If for the last attempt to update the registration of the location
area a MM specific procedure was performed, the value of the Update type IE in the ROUTING AREA UPDATE
REQUEST message shall indicate "combined RA/LA updating with IMSI attach". Furthermore the MS shall include
the TMSI status IE if no valid TMSI is available. If the MS has stored a valid LAI and the MS supports EMM combined
procedures, the MS shall include it in the Old location area identification IE in the ROUTING AREA UPDATE
REQUEST message. If timer T3302 is currently running, the MS shall stop timer T3302. If timer T3311 is currently
running, the MS shall stop timer T3311.

If the MS has stored a valid TMSI, the MS shall include the TMSI based NRI container IE in the ROUTING AREA
UPDATE REQUEST message.

A GPRS MS in MS operation modes B that is in an ongoing circuit-switched transaction, shall initiate the combined
routing area updating procedure after the circuit-switched transaction has been released, if the MS has changed the RA
during the circuit-switched transaction and if the network operates in network operation mode I.

A GPRS MS in MS operation mode A shall initiate the combined routing area updating procedure with IMSI attach
after the circuit-switched transaction has been released, if a normal GPRS attach or a normal routing area updating
procedure was performed during the circuit-switched transaction and provided that the network operates in network
operation mode I.

A GPRS MS in MS operation mode A shall perform the normal routing area update procedure during an ongoing
circuit-switched transaction.

If the MS initiates the combined routing area updating procedure for GPRS services and "SMS-only service", the MS
shall indicate "SMS only" in the Additional update type IE.

In Iu mode, if the MS wishes to prolong the established PS signalling connection after the normal routing area updating
procedure (for example, the MS has any CM application request pending), it may set a follow-on request pending
indicator on (see subclause 4.7.13).

In Iu mode, when a ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST is received by the SGSN over a new PS signalling
connection while there is an ongoing PS signalling connection (network is already in mode PMM-CONNECTED) for
this MS, the network shall progress the routing area update procedure as normal and release the previous PS signalling
connection when the routing area update procedure has been accepted by the network.

   NOTE 3: The re-establishment of the radio bearers of active PDP contexts is done as described in subclause
           "Service Request procedure".

If the combined routing area updating procedure is initiated due to the reception of the paging indication while T3346 is
running, the "follow-on request pending" indication shall be set to 1.

4.7.5.2.2            GMM Common procedure initiation
The network may initiate GMM common procedures, e.g. the GMM authentication and ciphering procedure.

4.7.5.2.3            Combined routing area updating procedure accepted by the network
Depending on the value of the update result IE received in the ROUTING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, two
different cases can be distinguished:

   Case 1)    The update result IE value indicates "combined RA/LA": Routing and location area updating is
              successful;

   Case 2)    The update result IE value indicates "RA only": Routing area updating is successful, but location area
              updating is not successful.

A ROUTING AREA UPDATE COMPLETE message shall be returned to the network if the ROUTING AREA
UPDATE ACCEPT message containsany of:

   -   a P-TMSI and/or a TMSI;

   -   Receive N-PDU Numbers (see 3GPP TS 44.065 [78] and 3GPP TS 25.322 [19b]); or

   -   a request for the provision of Inter RAT handover information.

If Receive N-PDU Numbers were included, the Receive N-PDU Numbers that are valid in the MS shall be included in
the ROUTING AREA UPDATE COMPLETE message.

If the network has requested the provision of Inter RAT handover information the MS shall return a ROUTING AREA
UPDATE COMPLETE message including the Inter RAT handover information IE, as applicable, to the network.

In Iu mode, if the network wishes to prolong the PS signalling connection (for example, if the mobile station has
indicated "follow-on request pending" in ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message) the network shall indicate
the "follow-on proceed" in the ROUTING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message. If the network wishes to release the PS
signalling connection, the network shall indicate "no follow-on proceed" in the ROUTING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT
message.

After that in Iu mode, the mobile station shall act according to the follow-on proceed flag included in the Update result
information element in the ROUTING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message (see subclause 4.7.13).

If the network supports CS Fallback, and the mobile station has indicated support of EMM combined procedures in MS
network capability, the network shall indicate in the Update result IE in the ROUTING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT
message that ISR is not activated.

4.7.5.2.3.1              Combined routing area updating successful

The description for normal routing area update as specified in subclause 4.7.5.1.3 shall be followed. In addition, the
following description for location area updating applies.

The handling at the receipt of the ROUTING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT depends on the value received in the update
result IE as specified below.

The TMSI reallocation may be part of the combined routing area updating procedure. The TMSI allocated is then
included in the ROUTING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message together with the location area identification (LAI).
The network shall, in this case, change to state GMM-COMMON-PROCEDURE-INITIATED and shall start the timer
T3350 as described in subclause 4.7.6.

The MS, receiving a ROUTING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, stores the received location area identification,
stops timer T3330, enters state MM IDLE, reset the location update attempt counter and sets the update status to U1
UPDATED. If the ROUTING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message contains an IMSI, the mobile station is not allocated
any TMSI, and shall delete any TMSI accordingly. If the ROUTING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message contains a
TMSI, the MS shall use this TMSI as new temporary identity. The MS shall delete its old TMSI and shall store the new
TMSI. In this case, an ROUTING AREA UPDATE COMPLETE message is returned to the network. If neither a TMSI
nor an IMSI has been included by the network in the ROUTING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, the old TMSI, if
any is available, shall be kept.

If the MS maintains a counter for "SIM/USIM considered invalid for non-GPRS services" events (see
subclause 4.1.1.6A), then the MS shall reset this counter.

If the MS is not configured for NAS signalling low priority, and any of the following conditions is fulfilled:

   -   the MS initiated the combined routing area updating procedure due to a change of the registered location area;

   -   the value of the Update type IE in the ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message indicated "combined
       RA/LA updating with IMSI attach"; or

   -   the MS indicated support of EMM combined procedures in the MS network capability;

then the MS may stop timer T3246 if running.

Any timer used for triggering the location updating procedure (e.g. T3211, T3212) shall be stopped if running.

The network receiving a ROUTING AREA UPDATE COMPLETE message stops timer T3350, changes to GMM-
REGISTERED state

   NOTE:       Upon receiving a ROUTING AREA UPDATE COMPLETE message, the SGSN sends a BSSAP+-
               TMSI-REALLOCATION-COMPLETE message as specified in 3GPP TS 29.018 [149].

4.7.5.2.3.2                Combined routing area updating successful for GPRS services only

Apart from the actions on the routing area updating attempt counter, the description for normal routing area update as
specified in subclause 4.7.5.1.3 shall be followed. In addition, the following description for location area updating
applies.

The SGSN shall use GMM cause #28 "SMS provided via GPRS in this routing area" in the ROUTING AREA
UPDATE ACCEPT message only if the MS requested "SMS-only service" by including the Additional update type IE
in the ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message. The SGSN may indicate in the Update result IE in the
ROUTING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message that ISR is activated.

The MS receiving the ROUTING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message takes one of the following actions depending on
the GMM cause:

   #2          (IMSI unknown in HLR);

           The MS shall stop timer T3330 if still running and shall reset the routing area updating attempt counter. The
           MS shall set the update status to U3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED and shall delete any TMSI, LAI and
           ciphering key sequence number. The MS shall enter state GMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE. The
           new MM state is MM IDLE. The SIM/USIM shall be considered as invalid for non-GPRS services until
           switching off or the SIM/USIM is removed. If the message has been successfully integrity checked by the
           lower layers and the MS maintains a counter for "SIM/USIM considered invalid for non-GPRS services",
           then the MS shall set this counter to MS implementation-specific maximum value.

   #16     (MSC temporarily not reachable); or

   #17     (Network failure)

           The MS shall stop timer T3330 if still running, and shall enter state MM-IDLE. The routing area updating
           attempt counter shall be incremented.

        If the routing area updating attempt counter is less than 5, and the stored RAI is equal to the RAI of the current
            serving cell and the GMM update status is equal to GU1 UPDATED:

           -   the MS shall keep the GMM update status GU1 UPDATED and changes state to GMM-
               REGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-UPDATE-MM. The MS shall start timer T3311. When timer T3311
               expires the combined routing area update procedure indicating "combined RA/LA updating with IMSI
               attach" is triggered again.

           If the routing area updating attempt counter is greater than or equal to 5:

           -   the MS shall start timer T3302 and shall change to state GMM-REGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-
               UPDATE-MM;

           -   a GPRS MS operating in MS operation mode A shall then proceed with appropriate MM specific
               procedure; a GPRS MS operating in MS operation mode B may then proceed with appropriate MM
               specific procedures.
               The MM sublayer shall act as in network operation mode II as long as the combined GMM procedures
               are not successful and no new RA is entered.

   # 22    (Congestion);

           The MS shall change to state GMM-REGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-UPDATE-MM, shall stop timer
           T3330 if still running, and shall enter state MM-IDLE. The MS shall set the routing area updating attempt
           counter to 5 and shall start timer T3302.

   # 28    (SMS provided via GPRS in this routing area);

           The MS shall stop timer T3330 if still running and shall reset the routing area updating attempt counter. The
           MS shall set the update status to U3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED and shall delete any TMSI, LAI and
           ciphering key sequence number. The MS shall enter state GMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE. The
           new MM state is MM IDLE.

           The MS stays in the current serving cell and applies the normal cell reselection process.

Other GMM causevalues and the case that no GMM cause IE was received are considered as abnormal cases. The
combined routing area updating shall be considered as failed for non-GPRS services. The specification of the MS
behaviour in those cases is specified in subclause 4.7.5.2.5.

4.7.5.2.4             Combined routing area updating not accepted by the network
If the combined routing area updating cannot be accepted, the network sends a ROUTING AREA UPDATE REJECT
message to the MS. An MS that receives a ROUTING AREA UPDATE REJECT message containing a reject cause
other than GMM cause value #25 or the message is integrity protected, shall stop the timer T3330, and shall enter the
state MM IDLE. If a ROUTING AREA UPDATE REJECT message containing a reject cause other than GMM cause
value #25 is received or the message is integrity protected, the MS shall stop any ongoing transmission of user data.

If the ROUTING AREA UPDATE REJECT message containing GMM cause value #25 was received without integrity
protection, then the MS shall discard the message.

If the routing area update request is rejected due to general NAS level mobility management congestion control, the
network shall set the GMM cause value to #22 "congestion" and assign a back-off timer T3346.

The MS shall then take different actions depending on the received reject cause:

   #3          (Illegal MS);

   #6          (Illegal ME), or

   #8          (GPRS services and non GPRS services not allowed);

        The MS shall set the GPRS update status to GU3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED and the update status to U3
        ROAMING NOT ALLOWED (and shall store it according to subclause 4.1.3.2) and shall delete any P-TMSI, P-
        TMSI signature, TMSI, RAI, LAI, ciphering key sequence number and GPRS ciphering key sequence number.
        The MS shall consider the SIM/USIM as invalid for GPRS and non GPRS services until switching off or the
        SIM/USIM is removed or the timer T3245 expires as described in subclause 4.1.1.6. The MS shall delete the list
        of equivalent PLMNs, and shall enter the state GMM-DEREGISTERED.

        If the message has been successfully integrity checked by the lower layers and the MS maintains a counter for
        "SIM/USIM considered invalid for GPRS services", then the MS shall set this counter to MS implementation-
        specific maximum value. If the message has been successfully integrity checked by the lower layers and the MS
        maintains a counter for "SIM/USIM considered invalid for non-GPRS services", then the MS shall set this
        counter to MS implementation-specific maximum value.

   NOTE 1: Optionally the MS starts the timer T3340 as described in subclause 4.7.1.9 for reject cause #8.

        If S1 mode is supported in the MS, the MS shall handle the EMM parameters EMM state, EPS update status,
        GUTI, last visited registered TAI, TAI list and KSI as specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 [120] for the case when the
        combined tracking area update procedure is rejected with the EMM cause with the same value.

   #7          (GPRS services not allowed);

        The MS shall set the GPRS update status to GU3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED (and shall store it according to
        subclause 4.1.3.2) and shall delete any P-TMSI, P-TMSI signature, RAI and GPRS ciphering key sequence
        number. The SIM/USIM shall be considered as invalid for GPRS services until switching off or the SIM/USIM
        is removed. The MS shall delete the list of equivalent PLMNs, and shall enter the state GMM-
        DEREGISTERED.

        If the message has been successfully integrity checked by the lower layers and the MS maintains a counter for
        "SIM/USIM considered invalid for GPRS services", then the MS shall set this counter to MS implementation-
        specific maximum value.

   NOTE 2: Optionally the MS starts the timer T3340 as described in subclause 4.7.1.9.

        If S1 mode is supported in the MS, the MS shall handle the EMM parameters EMM state, EPS update status,
        GUTI, last visited registered TAI, TAI list and KSI as specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 [120] for the case when the
        combined tracking area update procedure is rejected with the EMM cause with the same value.

   #9          (MS identity cannot be derived by the network);

        The MS shall set the GPRS update status to GU2 NOT UPDATED (and shall store it according to
        subclause 4.1.3.2), enter the state GMM-DEREGISTERED, and shall delete any P-TMSI, P-TMSI signature,
        RAI and GPRS ciphering key sequence number.

        A GPRS MS operating in MS operation mode A or B in network operation mode I which is already IMSI
        attached for CS services in the network, is still IMSI attached for CS services in the network.

        If the rejected request was not for initiating a PDN connection for emergency bearer services, then

        -   a GPRS MS operating in MS operation mode A or B shall proceed with appropriate MM specific procedures.
            The MM sublayer shall act as in network operation mode II as long as the combined GMM procedures are
            not successful and no new RA is entered; and

        -   the MS may subsequently, automatically initiate the GPRS attach procedure.

        If S1 mode is supported in the MS, the MS shall handle the EMM parameters EMM state, EPS update status,
        GUTI, last visited registered TAI, TAI list and KSI as specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 [120] for the case when the
        combined tracking area update procedure is rejected with the EMM cause with the same value.

   # 10     (Implicitly detached);

        A GPRS MS operating in MS operation mode A or B in network operation mode I, is IMSI detached for both
        GPRS and CS services in the network.

        The MS shall enter the state GMM-DEREGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE. If the rejected request was not for
        initiating a PDN connection for emergency bearer services, the MS shall then perform a new attach procedure.
        The MS should also activate PDP context(s) that were originally activated by the MS to replace any previously
        MS activated PDP context(s). The MS should also perform the procedures needed in order to activate any
        previously active multicast service(s).

        If S1 mode is supported in the MS, the MS shall handle the EMM state as specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 [120] for
        the case when the combined tracking area update procedure is rejected with the EMM cause with the same value.

   NOTE 3: In some cases, user interaction may be required and then the MS cannot activate the PDP/MBMS
           context(s) automatically.

   # 11     (PLMN not allowed);

      An MS in GAN mode shall request a PLMN list in GAN (see 3GPP TS 44.318 [76b]) prior to perform a PLMN
      selection from this list according to 3GPP TS 23.122 [14].

      If S1 mode is supported in the MS, the MS shall handle the EMM parameters EMM state, EPS update status and
      tracking area updating attempt counter as specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 [120] for the case when the combined
      tracking area update procedure is rejected with the EMM cause with the same value.

   # 14   (GPRS services not allowed in this PLMN);

      The MS shall delete any RAI, P-TMSI, P-TMSI signature, and GPRS ciphering key sequence number stored,
      shall set the GPRS update status to GU3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED (and shall store it according to
      subclause 4.1.3.2), shall reset the routing area updating attempt counter and shall change to state GMM-
      DEREGISTERED.

      The MS shall store the PLMN identity in the "forbidden PLMNs for GPRS service" list and if the MS is
      configured to use timer T3245 (see 3GPP TS 24.368 [135] or 3GPP TS 31.102 [112]) then the MS shall start
      timer T3245 and proceed as described subclause 4.1.1.6. If the message has been successfully integrity checked
      by the lower layers and the MS maintains a PLMN-specific PS-attempt counter for that PLMN, then the MS
      shall set this counter to the MS implementation-specific maximum value.

      A GPRS MS operating in MS operation mode A or B which is already IMSI attached for CS services is still
      IMSI attached for CS services in the network.

      A GPRS MS operating in MS operation mode A or B in network operation mode I shall then proceed with the
      appropriate MM specific procedure.

      As an implementation option, a GPRS MS operating in operation mode A or B may perform a PLMN selection
      according to 3GPP TS 23.122 [14].

      If an MS in GAN mode performs a PLMN selection, it shall request a PLMN list in GAN (see
      3GPP TS 44.318 [76b]) prior to perform a PLMN selection from this list according to 3GPP TS 23.122 [14].

      The MS shall not perform the optional PLMN selection in the case where the PLMN providing this reject cause
      is:

      -   On the "User Controlled PLMN Selector with Access Technology " or,

      -   On the "Operator Controlled PLMN Selector with Access Technology " list or,

      -   A PLMN identified as equivalent to any PLMN, within the same country, contained in the lists above.

      If S1 mode is supported in the MS, the MS shall handle the EMM parameters EMM state, EPS update status,
      GUTI, last visited registered TAI, TAI list, KSI and tracking area updating attempt counter as specified in
      3GPP TS 24.301 [120] for the case when the combined tracking area update procedure is rejected with the EMM
      cause with the same value.

   # 15   (No Suitable Cells In Location Area);

      The MS shall set the GPRS update status to GU3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED (and shall store it according to
      clause 4.1.3.2), shall reset the routing area updating attempt counter and shall change to state GMM-
      REGISTERED.LIMITED-SERVICE.

      The MS shall in addition set the update status to U3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED and shall reset the location
      update attempt counter. The new MM state is MM IDLE.

      The MS shall store the LAI in the list of "forbidden location areas for roaming".

      The MS shall start timer T3340 as described in subclause 4.7.1.9.

      The MS shall search for a suitable cell in another location area according to 3GPP TS 43.022 [82] and
      3GPP TS 25.304 [98].

   NOTE 5: The cell selection procedure is not applicable for an MS in GAN mode.

      The MS shall indicate the Update type IE "combined RA/LA updating with IMSI attach" when performing the
      routing area updating procedure.

      If S1 mode is supported in the MS, the MS shall handle the EMM parameters EMM state, EPS update status and

      tracking area update procedure is rejected with the EMM cause with the same value.

   #22    (Congestion);

      If the T3346 value IE is present in the ROUTING AREA UPDATE REJECT message and the value indicates
      that this timer is neither zero nor deactivated, the MS shall proceed as described below, otherwise it shall be
      considered as an abnormal case and the behaviour of the MS for this case is specified in subclause 4.7.5.2.5.

      The MS shall abort the routing area updating procedure, reset the routing area updating attempt counter and set
      the GPRS update status to GU2 NOT UPDATED. If the rejected request was not for initiating a PDN connection

       If the ROUTING AREA UPDATE REJECT message is not integrity protected, the ME shall start timer T3346
       with a random value from the default range specified in table 11.3a.

       The MS stays in the current serving cell and applies the normal cell reselection process. The routing area
       updating procedure is started, if still necessary, when timer T3346 expires or is stopped.

       If S1 mode is supported in the MS, the MS shall handle the EMM parameters EMM state, EPS update status, and
       tracking area updating attempt counter as specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 [120] for the case when the tracking area
       update procedure is rejected with the EMM cause with the same value.

   #25    (Not authorized for this CSG)

       Cause #25 is only applicable in UTRAN Iu mode and when received from a CSG cell. Other cases are
       considered as abnormal cases and the specification of the mobile station behaviour is given in
       subclause 4.7.5.2.5.

       The MS shall set the GPRS update status to GU3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED (and store it according to
       subclause 4.1.3.2) and shall reset the routing area updating attempt counter. The state is changed to GMM-
       REGISTERED.LIMITED-SERVICE.

       If the CSG ID and associated PLMN identity of the cell where the MS has sent the ROUTING AREA UPDATE
       REQUEST message are contained in the Allowed CSG list stored in the MS, the MS shall remove the entry
       corresponding to this CSG ID and associated PLMN identity from the Allowed CSG list.

       If the CSG ID and associated PLMN identity of the cell where the MS has sent the ROUTING AREA UPDATE
       REQUEST message are contained in the Operator CSG list, the MS shall proceed as specified in
       3GPP TS 23.122 [14] subclause 3.1A.

       The MS shall start timer T3340 as described in subclause 4.7.1.9.

Other values are considered as abnormal cases. The specification of the MS behaviour in those cases is described in
subclause 4.7.5.2.5.

4.7.5.2.5            Abnormal cases in the MS
The MS shall proceed as follows:

   1) If the combined routing area update was successful for GPRS services only and the ROUTING AREA UPDATE
      ACCEPT message contained a cause value not treated in subclause 4.7.5.2.3.2 or the GMM Cause IE is not
      included in the message, the MS shall proceed as follows:

       a) The MS shall stop timer T3330 if still running, and shall enter state MM IDLE. The routing area updating
          attempt counter shall be incremented;

       b) If the routing area updating attempt counter is less than 5, and the stored RAI is equal to the RAI of the
          current serving cell and the GMM update status is equal to GU1 UPDATED:

          -   the MS shall keep the GMM update status GU1 UPDATED and changes state to GMM-
              REGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-UPDATE-MM. The MS shall start timer T3311. When timer T3311

              expires the combined routing area update procedure indicating "combined RA/LA updating with IMSI
              attach" is triggered again; and

       c) If the routing area updating attempt counter is greater than or equal to 5:

          -   the MS shall start timer T3302 and shall change to state GMM-REGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-
              UPDATE-MM; and

          -   a GPRS MS operating in MS operation mode A shall then proceed with appropriate MM specific
              procedure; a GPRS MS operating in MS operation mode B may then proceed with appropriate MM
              specific procedures. The MM sublayer shall act as in network operation mode II or as long as the
              combined GMM procedures are not successful and no new RA is entered;

   2) Combined routing area updating and paging for non-GPRS services procedure collision

       If the MS receives a paging for non-GPRS services before the routing area updating procedure has been
       completed, the MS shall progress the routing area updating procedure and respond to the paging for non-GPRS
       services when the MS has completed the routing area updating procedure or aborted the procedure for other
       reasons. The MS shall return to MM state MM IDLE and proceed with the appropriate MM specific procedures
       to respond to the paging for non-GPRS services; and

   3) otherwise, the abnormal cases specified in subclause 4.7.5.1.5 apply with the following modification.

If the GPRS routing area updating attempt counter is incremented according to subclause 4.7.5.1.5 the next actions
depend on the Location Area Identities (stored on SIM/USIM and the one of the current serving cell) and the value of
the routing area updating attempt counter.

   -   if the update status is U1 UPDATED, and the stored LAI is equal to the one of the current serving cell and the
       routing area updating attempt counter is smaller than 5, then the mobile station shall keep the update status to U1
       UPDATED, the new MM state is MM IDLE substate NORMAL SERVICE;

   -   if the routing area updating attempt counter is smaller than 5 and, additionally, the update status is different from
       U1 UPDATED or the stored LAI is different from the one of the current serving cell, the mobile station shall
       delete any LAI, TMSI, ciphering key sequence number stored in the SIM/USIM and list of equivalent PLMNs
       and set the update status to U2 NOT UPDATED. The MM state remains MM LOCATION UPDATING
       PENDING; or

   -   if the routing area updating attempt counter is greater or equal to 5, the mobile station shall delete any LAI,
       TMSI, ciphering key sequence number stored in the SIM/USIM and the list of equivalent PLMNs, and shall set
       the update status to U2 NOT UPDATED.
       A GPRS MS operating in MS operation mode A shall then proceed with appropriate MM specific procedure; a
       GPRS MS operating in MS operation mode B may then proceed with appropriate MM specific procedures.
       The MM sublayer shall act as in network operation mode II as long as the combined GMM procedures are not
       successful and no new RA is entered. The new MM state is MM IDLE substate ATTEMPTING TO UPDATE or
       optionally MM IDLE substate PLMN SEARCH in order to perform a PLMN selection according to
       3GPP TS 23.122 [14].

The abnormal cases specified in subclause 4.7.5.1.6 apply.


4.7.6         P-TMSI reallocation procedure

4.7.6.0           General
A temporary mobile station identity for GPRS services, the Packet-TMSI (P-TMSI), is used for identification within the
radio interface signalling procedures. The structure of the P-TMSI is specified in 3GPP TS 23.003 [10]. The P-TMSI
has significance only within a routing area. Outside the routing area the P-TMSI has to be combined with the routing
area identification (RAI) to provide for an unambiguous identity.

The purpose of the P-TMSI reallocation procedure is to provide identity confidentiality, i.e. to protect a user against
being identified and located by an intruder (see 3GPP TS 43.020 [13], 3GPP TS 23.060 [74] and 3GPP TS 33.102 [5a]).




                                                           ETSI
3GPP TS 24.008 version 15.8.0 Release 15                  227                       ETSI TS 124 008 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


Usually, P-TMSI reallocation is performed at least at each change of a routing area (Such choices are left to the network
operator).

The reallocation of a P-TMSI is performed by the unique procedure defined in subclause 4.7.6. This procedure can only
be initiated by the network in state GMM-REGISTERED.

P-TMSI can also be implicitly reallocated in the attach or routing area updating procedures (see subclauses 4.7.3.1 and
4.7.5). The implicit reallocation of a P-TMSI is described in the corresponding subclauses.

   NOTE:      Normally, the P-TMSI reallocation will take place in conjunction with another GMM procedure, e.g. at
              routing area updating (see 3GPP TS 29.002 [37]).

4.7.6.1          P-TMSI reallocation initiation by the network
The network shall initiate the P-TMSI reallocation procedure by sending a P-TMSI REALLOCATION COMMAND
message to the MS and shall start the timer T3350.

The P-TMSI REALLOCATION COMMAND message shall contain a new combination of P-TMSI, RAI and
optionally a P-TMSI signature or a DCN-ID or both allocated by the network.

The network may suspend the transmission of user data during the P-TMSI reallocation procedure.

4.7.6.2          P-TMSI reallocation completion by the MS
Upon receipt of the P-TMSI REALLOCATION COMMAND message, the MS shall store the routing area identifier
(RAI) and the P-TMSI. Furthermore, the MS shall send a P-TMSI REALLOCATION COMPLETE message to the
network.

If a P-TMSI signature is present in the P-TMSI REALLOCATION COMMAND message, the MS shall store the new
P-TMSI signature and shall if available delete the old P-TMSI signature. If no P-TMSI signature is present in the P-
TMSI REALLOCATION COMMAND message, the old P-TMSI signature, if available, shall be kept.

If the P-TMSI REALLOCATION COMMAND message contains the DCN-ID IE, then the MS shall store the included
DCN-ID value together with the PLMN code of the registered PLMN in a DCN-ID list in a non-volatile memory in the
ME as described in 3GPP TS 24.301 [120], annex C.

4.7.6.3          P-TMSI reallocation completion by the network
Upon receipt of the P-TMSI REALLOCATION COMPLETE message, the network shall stop the timer T3350 and
shall consider both the old and the new P-TMSI and the corresponding P-TMSI signatures as valid until the old P-TMSI
can be considered as invalid by the network (see subclause 4.7.1.5).

In A/Gb mode, the GMM layer shall notify the LLC layer that the P-TMSI has been changed (see
3GPP TS 44.064 [78a]).

4.7.6.3A         Abnormal cases in the MS
The following abnormal cases can be identified:

       If different new P-TMSIs are included in subsequent P-TMSI REALLOCATION COMMAND messages due to
       an aborted or repeated P-TMSI reallocation procedure, the MS shall behave as described in subclause 4.7.6.2.
       Furthermore, the MS shall take action on the P-TMSI as described in subclause 4.7.1.5.

4.7.6.4          Abnormal cases on the network side
   The following abnormal cases can be identified:

   a) Lower layer failure

       If a lower layer failure is detected before the P-TMSI REALLOCATION COMPLETE message is received, the
       network shall consider both the old and the new P-TMSI as occupied until the old P-TMSI can be considered as
       invalid (see subclause 4.7.1.5).




                                                          ETSI
3GPP TS 24.008 version 15.8.0 Release 15                  228                       ETSI TS 124 008 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


      During this period the network:

      -   may first use the old P-TMSI for paging for an implementation dependent number of paging attempts in the
          case of network-originated transactions. Upon response from the MS, the network may re-initiate the P-TMSI
          reallocation procedure. If no response is received to the paging attempts, the network may use the new P-
          TMSI for paging for an implementation dependent number of paging attempts. Upon response from the MS,
          the network shall consider the new P-TMSI as valid and the old P-TMSI as invalid. If no response is received
          to the paging attempts, the network may use the IMSI for paging for an implementation dependent number of
          paging attempts;

   NOTE:     Paging with IMSI causes the MS to re-attach as described in subclause 4.7.9.1.

      -   shall consider the new P-TMSI as valid if it is used by the MS (see subclause 4.7.1.5); or

      -   may use the identification procedure followed by a new P-TMSI reallocation, if the MS uses the old P-TMSI.

   b) Expiry of timer T3350

      The P-TMSI reallocation procedure is supervised by the timer T3350 (see example in figure 4.7.6/1). On the first
      expiry of timer T3350, the network shall reset and restart timer T3350 and shall retransmit the P-TMSI
      REALLOCATION COMMAND message. This retransmission is repeated four times, i.e. on the fifth expiry of
      timer T3350, the network shall abort the P-TMSI reallocation procedure and shall follow the rules for case a as
      described above.

   c) P-TMSI reallocation and GPRS attach procedure collision

      If the network receives an ATTACH REQUEST message before the ongoing P-TMSI reallocation procedure has
      been completed, the network shall proceed with the GPRS attach procedure after deletion of the GMM context.

   d) P-TMSI reallocation and an MS initiated GPRS detach procedure collision

      If the network receives a DETACH REQUEST message before the ongoing P-TMSI reallocation procedure has
      been completed, the network shall abort the P-TMSI reallocation procedure and shall progress the GPRS detach
      procedure.

   e) P-TMSI reallocation and a routing area updating procedure collision

      If the network receives a ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message before the ongoing P-TMSI
      reallocation procedure has been completed, the network shall abort the P-TMSI reallocation procedure and shall
      progress the routing area updating procedure. The network may then perform a new P-TMSI reallocation.

   f) P-TMSI reallocation and a service request procedure collision

      If the network receives a SERVICE REQUEST message before the ongoing P-TMSI reallocation procedure
      procedure has been completed, the network shall progress both procedures.

4.7.7         Authentication and ciphering procedure

4.7.7a           Authentication and ciphering procedure used for UMTS authentication
                 challenge.
The purpose of the authentication and ciphering procedure is fivefold (see 3GPP TS 33.102 [5a] and
3GPP TS 43.020 [13]):

   -   to permit the network to check whether the identity provided by the MS is acceptable or not;

   -   to provide parameters enabling the MS to calculate a new GPRS UMTS ciphering key and a new GPRS UMTS
       integrity key;

   -   to let the network set the GSM ciphering mode (ciphering /no ciphering) and GSM ciphering algorithm;

   -   to permit the mobile station to authenticate the network; and

   -   to let the network set GSM integrity protection and GSM integrity algorithm (for control plane and optionally for
       user plane).

In Iu mode, and in the case of a UMTS authentication challenge, the authentication and ciphering procedure can be used
for authentication only.

The cases in which the authentication and ciphering procedure shall be used are defined in 3GPP TS 33.102 [5a],
3GPP TS 43.020 [13] and 3GPP TS 42.009 [5].

The authentication and ciphering procedure is always initiated and controlled by the network. However, in the case of a
UMTS authentication challenge, there is the possibility for the MS to reject the network.

The MS shall support the UMTS authentication challenge, if a USIM is inserted.

The authentication and ciphering procedure can be used for any combination of the following:

   -   authentication;

   -   setting of the GSM ciphering mode and the GSM ciphering algorithm; and

   -   setting of GSM integrity protection and the GSM integrity algorithm (for control plane and optionally for user
       plane).

   NOTE:      Setting of GSM integrity protection and the GSM integrity algorithm in the authentication and ciphering
              procedure is only applicable for an MS and a network supporting integrity protection in A/Gb mode.

In A/Gb mode, the network should not send any user data during the authentication and ciphering procedure.

A UMTS security context is established in the MS and the network when a UMTS authentication challenge is
performed in A/Gb mode or in Iu mode. After a successful UMTS authentication, the GPRS UMTS ciphering key, the
GPRS UMTS integrity key, the GPRS GSM ciphering key and the GPRS ciphering key sequence number, are stored
both in the network and the MS. Furthermore, in A/Gb mode both the ME and the network may derive and store a
GPRS GSM Kc128 as part of the UMTS security context as described in the subclause 4.7.7.3a. Furthermore, in A/Gb
mode, if integrity protection is used, both the MS and the network shall derive and store a GPRS GSM Kint as part of
the UMTS security context as described in the subclause 4.7.7.3b.

The purpose of the authentication and ciphering procedure is threefold (see 3GPP TS 43.020 [13]):

   -   to permit the network to check whether the identity provided by the MS is acceptable or not;

   -   to provide parameters enabling the MS to calculate a new GPRS GSM ciphering key; and

   -   to let the network set the GSM ciphering mode (ciphering/no ciphering) and GSM ciphering algorithm.

The authentication and ciphering procedure can be used for either:



                                                          ETSI
3GPP TS 24.008 version 15.8.0 Release 15                    230                         ETSI TS 124 008 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


   -   authentication only;

   -   setting of the GSM ciphering mode and the GSM ciphering algorithm only; or

   -   authentication and the setting of the GSM ciphering mode and the GSM ciphering algorithm.

The cases in which the authentication and ciphering procedure shall be used are defined in 3GPP TS 42.009 [5].

In A/Gb mode, the authentication and ciphering procedure is always initiated and controlled by the network. It shall be
performed in a non ciphered mode because of the following reasons:

   -   the network cannot decipher a ciphered AUTHENTICATION_AND_CIPHERING RESPONSE from an
       unauthorised MS and put it on the black list; and

   -   to be able to define a specific point in time from which on a new GPRS GSM ciphering key should be used
       instead of the old one.

GSM authentication challenge shall be supported by a ME supporting GERAN or UTRAN.

In A/Gb mode, the network should not send any user data during the authentication and ciphering procedure.

A GSM security context is established in the MS and the network when a GSM authentication challenge is performed in
A/Gb mode or in Iu mode. However, in Iu mode the MS shall not accept a GSM authentication challenge, if a USIM is
inserted. After a successful GSM authentication challenge, the GPRS GSM ciphering key and the GPRS ciphering key
sequence number, are stored both in the network and the MS.

4.7.7c            Change of the ciphering algorithm at PS Handover
For PS handover to A/Gb mode (see subclause 10.5.1.14 and 3GPP TS 44.060 [76]) the network shall either assign a
GSM ciphering algorithm to be used in the target cell or deactivate ciphering in the target cell. The MS shall start to use
the new GSM ciphering algorithm or deactivate ciphering upon an indication from the lower layers that the PS
handover procedure has been successfully completed (see 3GPP TS 44.060 [76])

After PS handover to Iu mode (see 3GPP TS 25.331 [23c] and 3GPP TS 44.118 [111]) the network shall activate
integrity protection and shall either assign a ciphering algorithm to be used in the target cell or deactivate ciphering in
the target cell, using the security mode control procedure (3GPP TS 25.331 [23c] and 3GPP TS 44.118 [111]).

If the GSM ciphering algorithm is changed at PS handover and the routing area updating procedure triggered by the PS
handover procedure is not accepted by the network, the MS shall delete any GPRS ciphering key sequence number and
proceed as specified in subclauses 4.7.5.1.4 and 4.7.5.2.4. If the routing area updating procedure fails, because the radio
resources assigned in the new cell are released before the MS receives a ROUTING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT
message, the MS shall delete any GPRS ciphering key sequence number and proceed as specified in
subclauses 4.7.5.1.5 item b and 4.7.5.2.5, respectively.

4.7.7.1           Authentication and ciphering initiation by the network
The network initiates the authentication and ciphering procedure by transferring an
AUTHENTICATION_AND_CIPHERING REQUEST message across the radio interface and starts timer T3360. The
AUTHENTICATION_AND_CIPHERING REQUEST message shall contain all parameters necessary to calculate the
response parameters when authentication is performed (see 3GPP TS 43.020 [13] and 3GPP TS 33.102 [5a]).

If authentication is requested, then the AUTHENTICATION_AND_CIPHERING REQUEST message shall contain
either:

   -   In a GSM authentication challenge, the GPRS ciphering key sequence number and the RAND, or

   -   In a UMTS authentication challenge, the GPRS ciphering key sequence number, the RAND and the AUTN.

In A/Gb mode, if authentication is not requested, then the AUTHENTICATION_AND_CIPHERING REQUEST
message shall not contain neither the GPRS ciphering key sequence number, the RAND nor the AUTN.

In A/Gb mode, if ciphering is requested, in a GSM authentication challenge or in a UMTS authentication challenge,
then the AUTHENTICATION_AND_CIPHERING REQUEST message shall indicate the GPRS GSM ciphering
algorithm.

In A/Gb mode, an MS supporting integrity protection shall ignore a GSM authentication challenge from the network.

In A/Gb mode, in a UMTS authentication challenge, if the MS has indicated support for integrity protection in MS
network capability IE included in the ATTACH REQUEST or ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message to the
network, then if the network supports integrity protection then the network shall activate integrity protection in the MS
(see subclause 4.7.3.1.3 and subclause 4.7.5.1.3). If the network does not activate integrity protection in the MS, then
the MS shall detach from the network.

In A/Gb mode, if no UMTS security context is available in the network or if no common UMTS security context is
available in the MS and the network, and if the MS has indicated support for integrity protection in MS network
capability IE to the network, then an authentication and activation of integrity protection and setting of ciphering mode
(enabled or disabled), shall take place in the same authentication and ciphering procedure. The network shall replay the
MS network capability IE and the MS radio access capability IE received from the MS in the latest ATTACH
REQUEST message or the latest ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, by including the MS network
capability IE and the MS radio access capability IE in the AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING REQUEST
message to the MS. The network shall select one of the GPRS GSM integrity algorithms indicated in the MS network
capability IE received from the MS in the latest ATTACH REQUEST message or ROUTING AREA UPDATE
REQUEST message. The selected GPRS GSM integrity algorithm shall be included in the AUTHENTICATION AND
CIPHERING REQUEST message. The network shall enable or disable ciphering and include the selected GPRS GSM
ciphering algorithm if ciphering is enabled. If ciphering is enabled, then the network shall select one of the GPRS GSM
ciphering algorithm indicated in the MS network capability IE received from the MS in the latest ATTACH REQUEST
message or ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message.The network shall calculate a message authentication
code for the AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING REQUEST message at the GMM layer with the new integrity
key, GPRS GSM Kint key, indicated by the GPRS ciphering key sequence number included in the
AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING REQUEST message. The new GPRS GSM Kint shall be calculated from the
new UMTS security context established in the same procedure as described in the subclause 4.7.7.3b. The
AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING REQUEST message shall include the calculated message authentication code
for integrity protection.

In A/Gb mode, if an established UMTS security context is available in the network and if the MS has indicated support
for integrity protection in the MS network capability IE, when authentication takes place in the authentication and
ciphering procedure (regardless whether a change of the integrity algorithm, ciphering algorithm or a change of
ciphering mode takes place in the same procedure), then the network shall replay the MS network capability IE and the
MS Radio Access Capability IE received from the MS in the latest ATTACH REQUEST message or the latest
ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, by including the MS network capability IE and the MS Radio
Access Capability IE into the AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING REQUEST message to the MS. If a change of
the GPRS GSM integrity algorithm takes place in the same procedure, then the network shall select one of the GPRS
GSMintegrity algorithms indicated in the MS network capability IE received from the MS in the latest ATTACH
REQUEST message or ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message. The selected GPRS GSM integrity algorithm
shall be included into the AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING REQUEST message. If the network decides to
change the ciphering mode or the ciphering algorithm or both, then if ciphering is enabled the network shall select one
of the GPRS GSM ciphering algorithms indicated in the MS network capability IE received from the MS in the latest
ATTACH REQUEST message or ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message. The network shall also include the
ciphering mode or the selected GPRS GSM ciphering algorithm or both, if ciphering is enabled (Ciphering algorithm
IE) in the AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING REQUEST message. The network calculates a message
authentication code over the parameters included in the AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING REQUEST message
at the GMM layer with the new integrity key GPRS GSM Kint indicated by the GPRS ciphering key sequence number
included by the AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING REQUEST message. The new GPRS GSM Kint shall be
calculated from the new UMTS security context established in the same procedure as described in the
subclause 4.7.7.3b. The AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING REQUEST message shall include the calculated
message authentication code for integrity protection.

In A/Gb mode, if an established UMTS security context context is available in the network and if the MS has indicated
support for integrity protection in the MS network capability IE to the network, and if integrity protection is in use, then
if only a change of the integrity algorithm or ciphering algorithm or both, or a change of the ciphering mode, is
requested in the authentication and ciphering procedure, then the AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING REQUEST
message shall include the new GPRS GSM integrity algorithm or the new setting of the ciphering mode and the new
GPRS GSM ciphering algorithm; that shall be taken into use.

   NOTE:      The AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING REQUEST message is protected by a message
              authentication code in the LLC layer when no authentication takes place in the authentication and
              ciphering procedure.Therefore, no message authentication code shall be calculated and included by the
              GMM layer into this message when only an algorithm change takes place. In addition, there is no need to
              replay the MS network capability IE and the MS Radio Access Capability IE in the AUTHENTICATION
              AND CIPHERING REQUEST message when no authentication takes place as a valid UMTS security
              context is already established between the MS and network.

The network includes the A&C reference number information element in the AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING
REQUEST message. Its value is chosen in order to link an AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING REQUEST in a
RA with its RESPONSE. The A&C reference number value might be based on the RA Colour Code value.

Additionally, the network may request the MS to include its IMEISV in the AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING
RESPONSE message.

4.7.7.2          Authentication and ciphering response by the MS
In A/Gb mode, an MS shall be ready to respond upon an AUTHENTICATION_AND_CIPHERING REQUEST
message at any time.

In UMTS, an MS shall be ready to respond upon an AUTHENTICATION_AND_CIPHERING REQUEST message at
any time whilst a PS signalling connection exists.

If a SIM is inserted in the MS, the MS shall ignore the Authentication Parameter AUTN IE if included in the
AUTHENTICATION_AND_CIPHERING REQUEST message and perform the GSM authentication challenge. It shall
not perform the authentication of the network described in subclause 4.7.7.5.1.

In a GSM authentication challenge, if the AUTHENTICATION_AND_CIPHERING REQUEST message includes the
authentication parameters RAND and GPRS CKSN, then upon receipt of the message, the MS processes the challenge
information and sends an AUTHENTICATION_AND_CIPHERING RESPONSE message to the network. The value of
the received A&C reference number information element shall be copied into the A&C reference number information
element in the AUTHENTICATION_AND_CIPHERING RESPONSE message. A GSM authentication challenge will
result in the SIM/USIM passing a SRES and a GPRS GSM ciphering key to the ME. The new GPRS GSM ciphering
key calculated from the challenge information shall overwrite the previous one and any previously stored GPRS UMTS
ciphering and GPRS UMTS integrity keys shall be deleted. The calculated GSM ciphering key shall be stored on the
SIM/USIM together with the GPRS ciphering key sequence number before the
AUTHENTICATION_AND_CIPHERING RESPONSE message is transmitted.

In a UMTS authentication challenge, if the AUTHENTICATION_AND_CIPHERING REQUEST message includes the
UMTS authentication parameters GPRS CKSN, RAND and AUTN, then upon receipt of the message, the MS verifies
the AUTN parameter and if this is accepted, the MS processes the challenge information and sends an
AUTHENTICATION_AND_CIPHERING RESPONSE message to the network. The value of the received A&C
reference number information element shall be copied into the A&C reference number information element in the
AUTHENTICATION_AND_CIPHERING RESPONSE message. A UMTS authentication challenge will result in the
USIM passing a RES, a GPRS UMTS ciphering key, a GPRS UMTS integrity key and a GPRS GSM ciphering key to
the ME. The new GPRS UMTS ciphering key, GPRS UMTS integrity key and GPRS GSM ciphering key calculated
from the challenge information shall overwrite the previous ones. The new GPRS UMTS ciphering key, GPRS UMTS
integrity key and GPRS GSM ciphering key shall be stored on the USIM together with the GPRS ciphering key
sequence number before the AUTHENTICATION_AND_CIPHERING RESPONSE message is transmitted.
Furthermore, in A/Gb mode if a GEA ciphering algorithm that requires a 128-bit ciphering key is taken into use, then a
new GPRS GSM Kc128 shall also be calculated as described in the subclause 4.7.7.3a.

In A/Gb mode, in a UMTS authentication challenge, if the MS supports integrity protection, then the MS shall ignore
the GPRS GSM ciphering key received from the USIM and not store the GPRS GSM ciphering key in the ME or on the
USIM.

In addition, in A/Gb mode, in a UMTS authentication challenge, if the MS has indicated support of integrity protection
in the MS network capability IE to the network, and if an authentication takes place in the authentication and ciphering
procedure, then a new GPRS GSM Kint shall also be calculated by the MS from the new UMTS security context
derived from AKA as described in the subclause 4.7.7.3b. The new GPRS GSM Kint shall be used by the MS to check
and verify the message authentication code recived in the AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING REQUEST
message as described in Annex H in 3GPP TS 43.020 [13]. If the integrity is successfully verified in the MS, then the
MS shall check if the replayed MS network capability IE and replayed MS Radio Access Capability IE received in the

3GPP TS 24.008 version 15.8.0 Release 15                 233                       ETSI TS 124 008 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING REQUEST message has not been altered compared to the latest MS network
capability IE and the latest MS Radio Access Capability IE that the MS sent to the network. If the replayed MS network
capability IE and the replayed MS Radio Access Capability IE received in the AUTHENTICATION AND
CIPHERING REQUEST message are not the same as the latest MS network capability IE and the MS Radio Access
Capability IE that the MS sent to the network, then the MS shall ignore the authentication and ciphering procedure. The
network may in addition indicate a GPRS GSM integrity algorithm and a new setting of the ciphering mode and GPRS
GSM ciphering algorithm, to be taken into use by the MS. If the integrity of the AUTHENTICATION AND
CIPHERING REQUEST message is not successfully verified in the GMM layer, then the MS shall ignore the
AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING REQUEST message.

In A/Gb mode, in a UMTS authentication challenge if the MS has no available UMTS security context and, if the MS
has indicated support for integrity protection in MS network capability IE to the network, then if the network does not
activate integrity protection by indicating a GPRS GSMintegrity algorithm or does not include a message authentication
code to the MS in AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING REQUEST message, then the MS shall ignore the
AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING REQUEST message.

In A/Gb mode, in a UMTS authentication challenge, if the MS has indicated support for integrity protection to the
network and if the integrity of the AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING REQUEST message is successfully
verified in the MS and the MS decides to reply by sending an AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING RESPONSE
message to the network, then the MS shall integrity protect the AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING RESPONSE
message by calculating an message authentication code at the GMM layer using the new integrity key GPRS GSM Kint
calculated by the MS from the new UMTS security context derived from AKA as described in the subclause 4.7.7.3b
and as described in Annex H in 3GPP TS 43.020 [13] and include the new message authentication code into the
AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING RESPONSE message. When a successful authentication takes place on the
USIM the GMM layer in the MS shall request the LLC layer to reset the IOV_updates counter to the value zero before
sending the AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING RESPONSE message to the network.

In Iu mode, an MS not capable of A/Gb mode shall ignore the Ciphering Algorithm IE in the
AUTHENTICATION_AND_CIPHERING REQUEST message. An MS capable of both Iu mode and A/Gb mode shall
store the received value in the Ciphering Algorithm IE in the AUTHENTICATION_AND_CIPHERING REQUEST
message until entering state GMM-DEREGISTERED, in order to use it at an inter system change to A/Gb mode. In
A/Gb mode, an MS supporting integrity protection shall store the received value in the Ciphering Algorithm IE when
entering GMM-DEREGISTERED and at MS power off as described in subclause 4.7.7.3a.

If the AUTHENTICATION_AND_CIPHERING REQUEST message does not include neither the GSM authentication
parameters (RAND and GPRS CKSN) nor the UMTS authentication parameters (RAND, AUTN and GPRS CKSN),
then upon receipt of the message, the MS replies by sending an AUTHENTICATION_AND_CIPHERING RESPONSE
message to the network.

In A/Gb mode, in the case of an established UMTS security context, if the MS has indicated support for integrity
protection to the network, the network may only indicate a GPRS GSM integrity algorithm or a GPRS GSM ciphering
algorithm or a change of ciphering mode setting in the AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING REQUEST message
without re-authentication to the MS. The AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING REQUEST message shall include
the new GPRS GSM integrity algorithm or the new GPRS GSM ciphering algorithm; or both, that shall be taken into
use. When the MS receives this AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING REQUEST message without requiring a new
authentication, then a new GPRS GSM Kint shall be calculated using the GPRS UMTS ciphering key and the GPRS
UMTS integrity key from the already established UMTS security context stored in the ME as described in the
subclause 4.7.7.3b and a new GPRS GSM Kc128 shall be calculated using the GPRS UMTS ciphering key and the GPRS
UMTS integrity key from the already established UMTS security context stored in the ME as described in the
subclause 4.7.7.3a and the MS replies by sending an AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING RESPONSE message to
the network.

   NOTE:      If only a change of GPRS GSM integrity algorithm or GPRS GSM encryption algorithm or a change of
              both algorithms is included in the AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING RESPONSE message
              without authentication, then the MS shall not integrity protect the AUTHENTICATION AND
              CIPHERING RESPONSE message at GMM layer. The MS does therefore not calculate and include a
              message authentication code into the AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING RESPONSE message at
              GMM layer. These GMM messages are instead integrity protected at the LLC layer with current UMTS
              security context.

In A/Gb mode, the GMM layer shall notify the LLC layer if ciphering shall be used or not and if yes which GSM
ciphering algorithm and GPRS GSM ciphering key that shall be used (see 3GPP TS 44.064 [78a]).

In A/Gb mode, if an established UMTS security context context is available in the network, if the MS has indicated
support of integrity protection to the network, then the GMM layer in the MS shall assign the GPRS GSM integrity
algorithm and the GPRS GSM Kint integrity key to the LLC layer after it has sent off the AUTHENTICATION AND
CIPHERING RESPONSE message to the network (see 3GPP TS 43.020 [13] and 3GPP TS 44.064 [78a]).

A ME supporting UMTS authentication challenge shall support the following procedure:

In order to avoid a synchronisation failure, when the mobile station receives an AUTHENTICATION AND
CIPHERING REQUEST message, the mobile station shall store the received RAND together with the RES returned
from the USIM in the volatile memory and associate it with the PS domain. When the MS receives a subsequent
AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING REQUEST message, if the stored RAND value for the PS domain is equal to
the new received value in the AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING REQUEST message, then the mobile station
shall not pass the RAND to the USIM, but shall immediately send the AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING
RESPONSE message with the stored RES for the PS domain. If, for the PS domain, there is no valid stored RAND in
the mobile station or the stored RAND is different from the new received value in the AUTHENTICATION AND
CIPHERING REQUEST message, the mobile station shall pass the RAND to the USIM, shall override any previously
stored RAND and RES with the new ones and start, or reset and restart timer T3316.

The RAND and RES values stored in the mobile station shall be deleted and timer T3316, if running, shall be stopped:

   -   upon receipt of a SECURITY MODE COMMAND (Iu mode only),
          SERVICE ACCEPT (Iu mode only),
          SERVICE REJECT (Iu mode only),
          ROUTING AREA UPDATE_ACCEPT
          or AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING REJECT message;

   -   upon expiry of timer T3316;

   -   if the mobile station enters the GMM states GMM-DEREGISTERED or GMM-NULL; or

   -   if the mobile station enters PMM-IDLE mode (Iu mode only).

4.7.7.3           Authentication and ciphering completion by the network
Upon receipt of the AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING RESPONSE message, the network stops the timer T3360
and checks the validity of the response (see 3GPP TS 43.020 [13] and 3GPP TS 33.102 [5a]). For this, it may use the
A&C reference number information element within the AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING RESPONSE message
to determine whether the response is correlating to the last request that was sent.

In A/Gb mode, in a UMTS authentication challenge if the MS has indicated support of integrity protection to the
network and if the AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING REQUEST message authentication, then the network shall
check and verify the message authentication code received in the AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING
RESPONSE message from the MS by using the new integrity key GPRS GSM Kint derived from the new UMTS
security context as described in subclause 4.7.7.3b and annex H in 3GPP TS 43.020 [13]. When a successful
authentication takes place after a successful verification of the RES and the message authentication code received in the
AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING RESPONSE message from the MS, the GMM layer in the network shall
indicate this successful authentication to the LLC layer. If the check and verification of the message authentication code
included in the AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING RESPONSE message fails in the network, then the network
shall ignore the GMM message. If the AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING RESPONSE message is received in
the network without a message authentication code then the network shall silently discard the GMM message.

In A/Gb mode, in the case of an established GSM security context, the GMM layer shall notify the LLC sublayer if
ciphering shall be used or not. Furthermore, if ciphering shall be used, then the GMM layer shall also notify the LLC
sublayer which GEA algorithm and GPRS GSM ciphering key that shall be used (see 3GPP TS 44.064 [78a]).

In A/Gb mode, in the case of an established UMTS security context, the GMM layer shall notify the LLC sublayer if
ciphering shall be used or not. Furthermore, if ciphering shall be used, then the GMM layer shall also notify the LLC
sublayer which GEA algorithm and which ciphering key (i.e. GPRS GSM ciphering key or GPRS GSM Kc128) that shall
be used (see 3GPP TS 44.064 [78a]). If the network has selected a GEA ciphering algorithm that requires a 128-bit
ciphering key, then the ME shall derive a GPRS GSM Kc128 as described in the subclause 4.7.7.3a.

In A/Gb mode, if an established UMTS security context context is available in the network, if the MS has indicated
support of integrity protection to the network, the GMM layer in the network shall assign the GPRS GSM integrity

algorithm and the GPRS GSM Kint integrity key to the LLC layer, after it has received the AUTHENTICATION AND
CIPHERING RESPONSE message from the MS (see 3GPP TS 43.020 [13] and 3GPP TS 44.064[78a]).

Upon receipt of the AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING FAILURE message, the network stops the timer T3360.
In Synch failure case, the core network may renegotiate with the HLR/AuC and provide the MS with new
authentication parameters.

4.7.7.3a          128-bit packet-switched GSM ciphering key
The ME and the network may derive and store a 128-bit packet-switched GSM key or GPRS GSM Kc128 from an
established UMTS security context. If the GPRS GSM Kc128 exits, then it is also part of the UMTS security context.

The ME with a USIM in use shall compute a new GPRS GSM Kc128 using the GPRS UMTS ciphering key and the
GPRS UMTS integrity key from an established UMTS security context as specified in 3GPP TS 33.102 [5a]. The new
GPRS GSM Kc128 shall be stored only in the ME. The ME shall overwrite the existing GPRS GSM Kc128 with the new
GPRS GSM Kc128. The ME shall delete the GPRS GSM Kc128 at switch off, when the USIM is disabled as well as
under the conditions identified in the subclause 4.1.3.2 and 4.7.7.4. The ME with a USIM in use shall apply the GPRS
GSM Kc128 when in A/Gb mode a GEA ciphering algorithm that requires a 128-bit ciphering key is taken into use.

The network shall compute the GPRS GSM Kc128 using the GPRS UMTS integrity key and the GPRS UMTS ciphering
key from an established UMTS security context as specified in 3GPP TS 33.102 [5a] only when in A/Gb mode a GEA
ciphering algorithm that requires a 128-bit ciphering key is to be used.

In A/Gb mode, if the MS supports integrity protection, the information in the Ciphering Algorithm IE together with the
IMSI from the USIM shall be stored in a non-volatile memory in the ME at MS power off. The information stored in
the Ciphering Algorithm IE can only be used if the IMSI from the USIM matches the IMSI stored in the ME non-
volatile memory at MS power on; otherwise the MS shall delete the Ciphering Algorithm IE.

4.7.7.3b          128-bit packet-switched GSM integrity key (in A/Gb mode and only if MS
                  supports integrity protection)
The ME and the network may derive and store a 128-bit packet-switched GPRS GSM Kint from an established UMTS
security context. If the GPRS GSM Kint exits, then it is also part of the UMTS security context.

The ME with a USIM in use shall compute a new GPRS GSM Kint using the GPRS UMTS ciphering key and the
GPRS UMTS integrity key from an established UMTS security context as specified in 3GPP TS 43.020 [13]. The new
GPRS GSM Kint shall be stored only in the ME. The ME shall overwrite the existing GPRS GSM Kint with the new
GPRS GSM Kint. The ME shall delete the GPRS GSM Kint at MS switch off, when the USIM is disabled as well as
under the conditions identified in the subclause 4.1.3.2 and 4.7.7.4. The ME with a USIM in use shall apply the GPRS
GSM Kint when in A/Gb mode a GIA integrityg algorithm that requires a 128-bit integrity key is taken into use.

The network shall compute the GPRS GSM Kint using the GPRS UMTS integrity key and the GPRS UMTS ciphering
key from an established UMTS security context as specified in 3GPP TS 43.020 [13]only when in A/Gb mode a GIA
integrity algorithm that requires a 128-bit integrity key is to be used.

At MS power off, the information in the Integrity Algorithm IE shall be stored in a non-volatile memory in the ME
together with the IMSI from the USIM. The information stored in the Integrity Algorithm IE can only be used if the
IMSI from the USIM matches the IMSI stored in the ME non-volatile memory at MS power on; otherwise the MS shall
delete the Integrity Algorithm IE.

4.7.7.4           GPRS ciphering key sequence number
The security parameters for authentication and ciphering are tied together in sets.

In a GSM authentication challenge, from a challenge parameter RAND both the authentication response parameter
SRES and the GPRS GSM ciphering key can be computed given the secret key associated to the IMSI.

In a UMTS authentication challenge, from a challenge parameter RAND, the authentication response parameter RES
and the GPRS UMTS ciphering key and the GPRS UMTS integrity key can be computed given the secret key
associated to the IMSI. Furthermore, in the USIM a GPRS GSM ciphering key can be computed from the GPRS UMTS
integrity key and the GPRS UMTS ciphering key by means of an unkeyed conversion function. Furthermore, in A/Gb
mode if a GEA ciphering algorithm that requires a 128-bit ciphering key is taken into use, then a GPRS GSM Kc128
shall also be calculated as described in the subclause 4.7.7.3a. Furthermore, in A/Gb mode, if the MS and the network

3GPP TS 24.008 version 15.8.0 Release 15                    236                        ETSI TS 124 008 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


support integrity protection, when a GIA integrity algorithm that requires a 128-bit integrity key is taken into use, then a
GPRS GSM Kint shall also be calculated as described in the subclause 4.7.7.3b.

In order to allow start of ciphering on a logical link without authentication, GPRS ciphering key sequence numbers are
introduced.

The GPRS ciphering key sequence number is managed by the network such that the AUTHENTICATION
AND CIPHERING REQUEST message contains the GPRS ciphering key sequence number allocated to the GPRS
GSM ciphering key (in case of a GSM authentication challenge) or the GPRS UMTS ciphering key and the GPRS
UMTS integrity key (in case of a UMTS authentication challenge) which may be computed from the RAND parameter
carried in that message.

If an authentication and ciphering procedure has been completed successfully and a GPRS ciphering key sequence
number is stored in the network, the network shall include a different GPRS ciphering key sequence number in the
AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING REQUEST message when it intiates a new authentication and ciphering
procedure.

If a GPRS ciphering key sequence number is contained in the first message during a GMM procedure, the network shall
include a different GPRS ciphering key sequence number in the AUTHENTICATION_AND_CIPHERING REQUEST
message when it initiates an authentication and ciphering procedure.

The MS stores the GPRS ciphering key sequence number with the GPRS GSM ciphering key (in case of a GSM
authentication challenge) and the GPRS UMTS ciphering key and the GPRS UMTS integrity key (in case of a UMTS
authentication challenge), and includes the corresponding GPRS ciphering key sequence number in the ROUTING
AREA UPDATE REQUEST, SERVICE REQUEST and ATTACH REQUEST messages.

If the GPRS ciphering key sequence number is deleted, the associated GPRS GSM ciphering key, GPRS UMTS
ciphering key, GPRS UMTS integrity key, GPRS GSM Kc128 and GPRS GSM Kint shall be deleted if any (i.e. the
established GSM security context or the UMTS security context is no longer valid).

In Iu mode, the network may choose to start ciphering and integrity checking with the stored GPRS UMTS ciphering
key and the stored GPRS UMTS integrity key (under the restrictions given in 3GPP TS 42.009 [5] and
3GPP TS 33.102 [5a]) if the stored GPRS ciphering key sequence number and the one given from the MS are equal.

In A/Gb mode, the network may choose to start ciphering with the stored GPRS GSM ciphering key or GPRS GSM
Kc128 (under the restrictions given in 3GPP TS 42.009 [5]) if the stored GPRS ciphering key sequence number and the
one given from the MS are equal and the previously negotiated ciphering algorithm is known and supported in the
network. When ciphering is requested at GPRS attach, the authentication and ciphering procedure shall be performed
since the MS does not store the ciphering algorithm after entering state GMM-DEREGISTERED.

   NOTE 1: The decision of starting ciphering with the GPRS GSM ciphering key or the GPRS GSM Kc128 depends
           on whether the network indicates in the AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING REQUEST message a
           GEA ciphering algorithm which requires a 64 or 128-bit ciphering key as specified in
           3GPP TS 33.102 [5a].

In A/Gb mode, if MS indicates support of integrity protection in the MS network capability IE to the network, if the ME
has a Integrity Algorithm IE and a Ciphering Algorithm IE stored in the ME non-volatile memory at MS power on, then
the GMM layer shall calculate a GPRS GSM Kint key as described in subclause 4.7.7.3b and a GPRS GSM Kc128 key
as described in subclause 4.7.7.3a and indicate to the LLC layer before sending the ATTACH REQUEST message that
LLC layer shall start integrity protection with the indicated GPRS GSM Kint key and the integrity algorithm (indicated
in the stored Integrity Algorithm IE). The GMM layer shall also assign the GPRS GSM Kc128 key and the ciphering
algorithm (indicated in the stored Ciphering Algorithm IE) to the LLC layer. The network shall start integrity protection
in the LLC layer after reception of the ATTACH REQUEST message with the stored GPRS GSM Kint and the integrity
algorithm identified by the stored GPRS GSMintegrity algorithm used when UE was previously attached if the GPRS
GSMintegrity algorithm is known and supported in the network, and if the stored GPRS ciphering key sequence number
and the one given from the MS are equal.

Upon GPRS attach, if ciphering is to be used, an AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING REQUEST message shall
be sent to the MS to start ciphering. In A/Gb mode, upon GPRS attach, if the MS and network supports integrity
protection, then the network may choose to start ciphering with the stored GPRS GSM ciphering key or GPRS GSM
Kc128 (under the restrictions given in 3GPP TS 42.009 [5]) if the stored GPRS ciphering key sequence number and the
one given from the MS in the ATTACH REQUEST message or ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message are
equal and the previously negotiated ciphering algorithm is known and supported in the network, without initiating a
authentication and ciphering procedure.

If the GPRS ciphering key sequence number stored in the network does not match the GPRS ciphering key sequence
number received from the MS in the ATTACH REQUEST message, then the network should authenticate the MS.

In A/Gb mode, the MS starts ciphering after sending the AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING RESPONSE
message. The network starts ciphering when a valid AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING RESPONSE is received
from the MS.

In Iu mode, the MS starts ciphering and integrity checking according to the conditions specified in specification
3GPP TS 25.331 [23c].

In A/Gb mode, as an option, the network may decide to continue ciphering without sending an AUTHENTICATION
AND CIPHERING REQUEST message after receiving a ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message with a valid
GPRS ciphering key sequence number. Both the MS and the network shall use the latest ciphering parameters. The
network starts ciphering when sending the ciphered ROUTING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message to the MS. The MS
starts ciphering after receiving a valid ciphered ROUTING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message from the network.

   NOTE 2: In some specifications the term KSI (Key Set Identifier) is used instead of the term GPRS ciphering key
           sequence number.

4.7.7.5           Authentication not accepted by the network
If the authentication response (RES or SRES) is not valid, the network response depends upon the type of identity used
by the MS in the first message:

   -   If the P-TMSI has been used, the network may decide to initiate the identification procedure. If the IMSI given
       by the MS differs from the one the network had associated with the P-TMSI, the authentication should be
       restarted with the correct parameters. If the IMSI provided by the MS is the expected one (i.e. authentication has
       really failed), the network should send an AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING REJECT message to the
       mobile station.

   -   If the IMSI has been used, or the network decides not to try the identification procedure, an
       AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING REJECT message should be transferred to the MS.

Upon receipt of an AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING REJECT message,

   a) if the message has been successfully integrity checked by the lower layers, the MS shall set the GPRS update
      status to GU3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED and shall delete the P-TMSI, P-TMSI signature, RAI and GPRS
      ciphering key sequence number stored. If available, also the TMSI, LAI and ciphering key sequence number
      shall be deleted and the update status shall be set to U3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED. The SIM/USIM shall be
      considered as invalid until switching off or the SIM/USIM is removed. If the MS maintains a counter for
      "SIM/USIM considered invalid for GPRS services", then the MS shall set this counter to MS implementation-
      specific maximum value. If the MS maintains a counter for "SIM/USIM considered invalid for non-GPRS
      services", then the MS shall set this counter to MS implementation-specific maximum value.

       If S1 mode is supported by the MS, the MS shall in addition handle the EMM parameters EMM state, EPS
       update status, last visited registered TAI, TAI list, GUTI and KSIASME as specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 [120] for
       the case when an EPS authentication is not accepted by the network.

   b) if the message is received without integrity protection, then the MS shall start timer T3247 with a random value
      uniformly drawn from the range between 30 minutes and 60 minutes, if the timer is not running (see
      subclause 4.1.1.6A). Additionally, the MS shall:

       -   if the MS maintains a counter for "SIM/USIM considered invalid for GPRS services" events and the counter
           has a value less than an MS implementation-specific maximum value, proceed as specified in
           subclause 4.1.1.6A, list item 6.a) for the case an ATTACH REJECT or ROUTING AREA UPDATE
           REJECT message is received without integrity protection; and

       -   otherwise proceed as specified under list item a) above for the case that the message has been successfully
           checked by the lower layers.

List item b) above is also applicable, if the message is received in A/Gb mode.

If the AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING REJECT message is received, the MS shall abort any GMM procedure,
shall stop the timers T3310, T3317, T3330, T3318 or T3320 (if they were running) and shall enter state GMM-
DEREGISTERED.

In UTRAN Iu mode, depending on local regulations or operator preference for emergency bearer services, if the MS has
a PDN connection for emergency bearer services established or is establishing a PDN connection for emergency bearer
services, the SGSN need not follow the procedures specified for the authentication failure in the present subclause, the
SGSN can continue with the ongoing GMM specific procedure or Session Management procedure. Upon completion of
the GMM procedure or Session management procedure, the SGSN shall deactivate all non-emergency PDP contexts, if
any, by initiating a PDP context deactivation procedure. The network shall consider the MS to be attached for
emergency bearer services only.

4.7.7.5.1            Authentication not accepted by the MS
In a UMTS authentication challenge, the authentication procedure is extended to allow the MS to check the authenticity
of the core network. Thus allowing, for instance, detection of false base station.

Following a UMTS authentication challenge, the MS may reject the core network, on the grounds of an incorrect
AUTN parameter (see 3GPP TS 33.102 [5a]). This parameter contains two possible causes for authentication failure:

   a) MAC code failure

If the MS considers the MAC code (supplied by the core network in the AUTN parameter) to be invalid, it shall send a
AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING FAILURE message to the network, with the GMM cause 'MAC failure'. The
MS shall then follow the procedure described in subclause 4.7.7.6 (f).

   b) SQN failure

       If the MS considers the SQN (supplied by the core network in the AUTN parameter) to be out of range, it shall
           send a AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING FAILURE message to the network, with the GMM cause
           'Synch failure' and the re-synchronization token AUTS provided by the USIM (see 3GPP TS 33.102 [5a]).
           The MS shall then follow the procedure described in subclause 4.7.7.6 (g).

In Iu mode, an MSwith a USIM inserted shall reject the authentication challenge if no Authentication Parameter AUTN
IE was present in the AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message (i.e. a GSM authentication challenge has been received
when the MS expects a UMTS authentication challenge). In such a case, the MS shall send the AUTHENTICATION
AND CIPHERING FAILURE message to the network, with the GMM cause ‘GSM authentication unacceptable’. The
MS shall then follow the procedure described in subclause 4.7.7.6 (f).

If the MS returns an AUTHENTICATION_AND_CIPHERING_FAILURE message to the network, the MS shall
delete any previously stored RAND and RES and shall stop timer T3316, if running.

If the MS has a PDN connection for emergency bearer services established or is establishing such a PDN connection,
additional MS requirements are specified in subclause 4.7.7.6, under "for items f and g".

4.7.7.6          Abnormal cases
The following abnormal cases can be identified:

   a) Lower layer failure

       Upon detection of a lower layer failure before the AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING RESPONSE
       message is received, the network shall abort the procedure.

   b) Expiry of timer T3360

       The network shall, on the first expiry of the timer T3360, retransmit the AUTHENTICATION AND
       CIPHERING REQUEST message and shall reset and start timer T3360. This retransmission is repeated four
       times, i.e. on the fifth expiry of timer T3360, the procedure shall be aborted.

   c) Collision of an authentication and ciphering procedure with a GPRS attach procedure

      If the network receives an ATTACH REQUEST message before the ongoing authentication procedure has been
      completed and no GPRS attach procedure is pending on the network (i.e. no ATTACH ACCEPT/REJECT
      message has to be sent as an answer to an ATTACH REQUEST message), the network shall abort the
      authentication and ciphering procedure and proceed with the new GPRS attach procedure.

   d) Collision of an authentication and ciphering procedure with a GPRS attach procedure when the authentication
      and ciphering procedure has been caused by a previous GPRS attach procedure

      If the network receives an ATTACH REQUEST message before the ongoing authentication procedure has been
      completed and a GPRS attach procedure is pending (i.e. an ATTACH ACCEPT/REJECT message has still to be
      sent as an answer to an earlier ATTACH REQUEST message), then:

      -   If one or more of the information elements in the ATTACH REQUEST message differs from the ones
          received within the previous ATTACH REQUEST message, the network shall not treat the authentication
          any further and proceed with the GPRS attach procedure; or

      -   If the information elements do not differ, then the network shall not treat any further this new ATTACH
          REQUEST message.

   d1) Collision of an authentication and ciphering procedure with a GPRS detach procedure

      GPRS detach containing cause "power off":

          If the network receives a DETACH REQUEST message before the ongoing authentication and ciphering
          procedure has been completed, the network shall abort the authentication and ciphering procedure and shall
          progress the GPRS detach procedure.

      GPRS detach containing other causes than "power off":

          If the network receives a DETACH REQUEST message before the ongoing authentication and ciphering
          procedure has been completed, the network shall complete the authentication and ciphering procedure and
          shall respond to the GPRS detach procedure as described in subclause 4.7.4.

   e) Collision of an authentication and ciphering procedure with a routing area updating procedure

      If the network receives a ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message before the ongoing authentication
      procedure has been completed, the network shall progress both procedures.

   (f) Authentication failure (GMM cause #18 "MAC failure" or #21 "GSM authentication unacceptable")

      The MS shall send an AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING FAILURE message, with GMM cause ‘MAC
      failure’ or ‘GSM authentication unacceptable’ according to subclause 4.7.7.5.1, to the network and start timer
      T3318. Furthermore, the MS shall stop any of the retransmission timers that are running (e.g. T3310, T3321,
      T3330 or T3317). Upon the first receipt of an AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING FAILURE message
      from the MS with GMM cause ‘MAC failure’ or ‘GSM authentication unacceptable’ the network may initiate
      the identification procedure described in subclause 4.7.8. This is to allow the network to obtain the IMSI from
      the MS. The network may then check that the P-TMSI originally used in the authentication challenge

      corresponded to the correct IMSI. Upon receipt of the IDENTITY REQUEST message from the network, the
      MS shall send the IDENTITY RESPONSE message.

   NOTE:     Upon receipt of an AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING FAILURE message from the MS with reject
             cause "MAC failure" or "GSM authentication unacceptable", the network may also terminate the
             authentication procedure (see subclause 4.7.7.5).

      If the P-TMSI/IMSI mapping in the network was incorrect, the network should respond by sending a new
      AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING REQUEST message to the MS. Upon receiving the new
      AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING REQUEST message from the network, the MS shall stop timer
      T3318, if running, and then process the challenge information as normal. If the P-TMSI/IMSI mapping in the
      network was correct, the network should terminate the authentication and ciphering procedure by sending an
      AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING REJECT message.

      If the network is validated successfully (an AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING REQUEST message that
      contains a valid SQN and MAC is received), the MS shall send the AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING
      RESPONSE message to the network and shall start any retransmission timers (e.g. T3310, T3321, T3330 or
      T3317), if they were running and stopped when the MS received the first failed AUTHENTICATION AND
      CIPHERING REQUEST message.

      If the MS receives the second AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING REQUEST message while T3318 is
      running and

      -   the MAC value cannot be resolved; or

      -   the message was received in UMTS and contains a GSM authentication challenge,

      the MS shall follow the procedure specified in this subclause (f), starting again from the beginning. If the SQN is
      invalid, the MS shall proceed as specified in (g).

      It can be assumed that the source of the authentication challenge is not genuine (authentication not accepted by
      the MS) if any of the following occurs:

      -   the timer T3318 expires;

      -   the MS detects any combination of the authentication failures: "MAC failure", "invalid SQN", and "GSM
          authentication unacceptable", during three consecutive authentication challenges. The authentication
          challenges shall be considered as consecutive only, if the authentication challenges causing the second and
          third authentication failure are received by the MS, while the timer T3318 or T3320 started after the previous
          authentication failure is running.

      The MS shall stop timer T3318, if the timer is running and the MS detects a lower layer failure, the network
      releases the PS signalling connection, the MS performs inter-system change to S1 mode, or the MS initiates a
      GPRS suspension procedure (see 3GPP TS 44.018 [84]).

      When it has been deemed by the MS that the source of the authentication challenge is not genuine
      (authentication not accepted by the MS), the MS shall behave as described in subclause 4.7.7.6.1.

   (g) Authentication failure (GMM cause #19 "Synch failure"):

      The MS shall send an AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING FAILURE message, with the GMM cause
      "Synch failure", to the network and start the timer T3320. Furthermore, the MS shall stop any of the
      retransmission timers that are running (e.g. T3310, T3321, T3330 or T3317). Upon the first receipt of an
      AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING message from the MS with the GMM cause "synch failure", the
      network shall use the returned AUTS parameter from the authentication & ciphering failure parameter IE in the
      AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING FAILURE message, to re-synchronise. The re-synchronisation
      procedure requires the SGSN to delete all unused authentication vectors for that IMSI and obtain new vectors
      from the HLR. When re-synchronisation is complete, the network shall initiate the authentication & ciphering
      procedure. Upon receipt of the AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING REQUEST message, the MS shall stop
      timer T3320, if running.

   NOTE:     Upon receipt of two consecutive AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING FAILURE messages from the
             MS with reject cause "synch failure", the network may terminate the authentication procedure by sending
             an AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING REJECT message.

      If the network is validated successfully (a new AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING REQUEST message is
      received which contains a valid SQN and MAC) while T3320 is running, the MS shall send the
      AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING RESPONSE message to the network and shall start any retransmission
      timers (i.e. T3310, T3321, T3330 or T3317), if they were running and stopped when the MS received the first
      failed AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING REQUEST message.

      If the MS receives the second AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING REQUEST message while T3320 is
      running and

      -   the MAC value cannot be resolved; or

      -   the message was received in Iu mode and contains a GSM authentication challenge,

      the MS shall proceed as specified in (f). If the SQN is invalid, the MS shall follow the procedure specified in this
      subclause (g), starting again from the beginning.

      The MS shall deem that the network has failed the authentication check and behave as described in
      subclause 4.7.7.6.1, if any of the following occurs:

      -   the timer T3320 expires;

      -   the MS detects any combination of the authentication failures: "MAC failure", "invalid SQN", and "GSM
          authentication unacceptable", during three consecutive authentication challenges. The authentication
          challenges shall be considered as consecutive only, if the authentication challenges causing the second and

           third authentication failure are received by the MS, while the timer T3318 or T3320 started after the previous
           authentication failure is running.

       The MS shall stop timer T3320, if the timer is running and the MS detects a lower layer failure, the network
       releases the PS signalling connection, the MS performs inter-system change to S1 mode, or the MS initiates a
       GPRS suspension procedure (see 3GPP TS 44.018 [84]).

       When it has been deemed by the MS that the source of the authentication challenge is not genuine
       (authentication not accepted by the MS), the MS shall behave as described in subclause 4.7.7.6.1.

       Upon receipt of an AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING REJECT message, the UE shall perform the
       actions as specified in subclause 4.7.7.5.

For items f and g:

       Depending on local requirements or operator preference for emergency bearer services, if the MS has a PDN
       connection for emergency bearer services established or is establishing such a PDN connection, the SGSN need
       not follow the procedures specified for the authentication failure specified in the present subclause and shall
       continue using the current security context, if any. The SGSN shall deactivate all non-emergency PDP contexts,
       if any, by initiating a PDP context deactivation procedure. If there is an ongoing session management procedure,
       the SGSN shall deactivate all non-emergency PDP contexts upon completion of the session management
       procedure. The network shall consider the MS to be attached for emergency bearer services only.

       If an MS has a PDN connection for emergency bearer services established or is establishing such a PDN
       connection when timer T3318 or T3320 expires, the MS shall not deem that the network has failed the
       authentication check and not behave as described in subclause 4.7.7.6.1. Instead the MS shall continue using the
       current security context, if any. The MS shall deactivate all non-emergency PDP contexts, if any, by initiating a
       PDP context deactivation procedure. If there is an ongoing session management procedure, the MS shall
       deactivate all non-emergency PDP contexts upon completion of the session management procedure. The MS
       shall start any retransmission timers (e.g. T3310, T3317, T3321 or T3330) if:

       -   they were running and stopped when the MS received the AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING REJECT
           message and detected an authentication failure; and

       -   the procedures associated with these timers have not yet been completed.

       The MS shall consider itself to be attached for emergency bearer services only.

4.7.7.6.1               MS behaviour towards a network that has failed the authentication procedure
If the MS deems that the network has failed the authentication check, then it shall request RR or RRC to release the RR
connection and the PS signalling connection, if any, and bar the active cell or cells (see 3GPP TS 25.331 [23c] and
3GPP TS 44.018 [84]). The MS shall start any retransmission timers (i.e. T3310, T3321, T3330 or T3317), if they were

running and stopped when the MS received the first AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING REQUEST message
containing an invalid MAC or invalid SQN, or no AUTN when a UMTS authentication challenge was expected.

4.7.7.7          Use of established security contexts
In A/Gb mode, in the case of an established GSM security context, the GPRS GSM ciphering key shall be taken into
use by the MS before the AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING RESPONSE message is transmitted.

In A/Gb mode, in the case of an established UMTS security context, and if the network indicates in the
AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING REQUEST message to the MS that a GEA ciphering algorithm that requires
a 64-bit ciphering key shall be taken into use, then the GPRS GSM ciphering key shall be taken into use by the MS
before the AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING RESPONSE message is transmitted. The network shall derive a
GPRS GSM ciphering key from the GPRS UMTS ciphering key and the GPRS UMTS integrity key, by using the
conversion function named "c3" defined in 3GPP TS 33.102 [5a].

In A/Gb mode, in the case of an established UMTS security context, and if the network indicates in the
AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING REQUEST message to the MS that a GEA ciphering algorithm that requires
a 128-bit ciphering key shall be taken into use, then the MS shall take the following actions:

   -   if authentication is not requested and a GEA ciphering algorithm that requires 64-bit ciphering key is in use, the
       MS shall take into use the GPRS GSM Kc128 derived by the ME from the GPRS UMTS ciphering key and GPRS
       UMTS integrity key of the established UMTS security context in use (see 3GPP TS 33.102 [5a]) before the
       AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING RESPONSE message is transmitted;.

   -   if authentication is not requested and a GEA ciphering algorithm that requires 128-bit ciphering key is in use, the
       GPRS GSM Kc128 of the established UMTS security context in use still applies;

       otherwise, the MS shall take into use the GPRS GSM Kc128 derived by the ME from the GPRS UMTS ciphering
       key and the GPRS UMTS integrity key provided by the USIM during the latest successful authentication
       procedure (see subclause 4.7.7.3a) before the AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING RESPONSE message is
       transmitted.

In A/Gb mode, in the case of an established UMTS security context, and if the network indicates in the
AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING REQUEST message to the MS that a GEA ciphering algorithm that requires
a 128-bit ciphering key shall be taken into use, then the network shall derive a GPRS GSM Kc128 (see
subclause 4.7.7.3a).

In A/Gb mode, if an established UMTS security context context is available in the network, if the MS indicates support
of integrity protection to the network and the network supports integrity protection, if the network indicates in the
AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING REQUEST message to the MS that a new GPRS GSM integrity algorithm
shall be taken into use but no authentication is requested, then the GPRS GSM Kint of the established UMTS security
context in use still applies in the MS and network.

In A/Gb mode, in the case of an established UMTS security context, and if the network indicates in the
AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING REQUEST message to the MS that a GIA integrity protection algorithm that
requires a 128-bit integrity key shall be taken into use but no authentication is requested, then the GPRS GSM Kint of
the established UMTS security context in use still applies in the MS.

In A/Gb mode, if during an ongoing, already ciphering protected RR connection, the network initiates a new
Authentication and ciphering procedure, the new GPRS GSM ciphering key or GPRS GSM Kc128 shall be taken into
use by the MS before the AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING RESPONSE message is transmitted. In case of
inter-system change to Iu mode after receipt of the AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING REQUEST message, the
MS and the network shall take the new keys into use immediately after the inter-system change.

In Iu mode, in the case of an established GSM security context, the ME shall derive a GPRS UMTS ciphering key and a
GPRS UMTS integrity key from the GPRS GSM ciphering key by using the conversion functions named "c4" and "c5"
defined in 3GPP TS 33.102 [5a]. The derived GPRS UMTS ciphering key and GPRS UMTS integrity key shall be
taken into use by the MS when a valid SECURITY MODE COMMAND message indicating PS domain is received
during an RR connection (the definition of a valid SECURITY MODE COMMAND message is given in
3GPP TS 25.331 [23c]). The network shall derive a GPRS UMTS ciphering key and a GPRS UMTS integrity key from
the GPRS GSM ciphering key by using the conversion functions named "c4" and "c5" defined in 3GPP TS 33.102 [5a].

In Iu mode, in the case of an established UMTS security context, the GPRS UMTS ciphering key and the GPRS UMTS
integrity key shall be taken into use by the MS when a valid SECURITY MODE COMMAND message indicating PS

domain is received during a PS signalling connection (the definition of a valid SECURITY MODE COMMAND
message is given in 3GPP TS 25.331 [23c]).

In Iu mode, if the MS received a valid SECURITY MODE COMMAND message indicating PS domain in Iu mode or a
valid AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING REQUEST message in A/Gb mode before the network initiates a new
authentication and ciphering procedure and establishes a new GSM/UMTS security context, the new GPRS UMTS
ciphering key and GPRS UMTS integrity key are taken into use by the MS, when a new valid SECURITY MODE
COMMAND message indicating PS domain is received during the PS signalling connection. In case of inter-system
change to A/Gb mode, the MS and the network shall take the new keys into use immediately after the inter-system
change.

4.7.7.8          Handling of keys at intersystem change from Iu mode to A/Gb mode
At an inter-system change from Iu mode to A/Gb mode, ciphering may be started (see 3GPP TS 44.064 [78a]) without
any new authentication and ciphering procedure. Deduction of the appropriate security key for ciphering in A/Gb mode,
depends on the current GSM/UMTS security context stored in the MS and the network.

The ME shall handle the GPRS GSM ciphering key and a potential GPRS GSM Kc128 according to table 4.7.7.8.1.

In the case of an established GSM security context, before any initial GMM message is sent in the new cell in A/Gb
mode, the GMM layer in the MS shall notify the LLC layer if ciphering shall be used or not. If ciphering shall be used,
then the GPRS GSM ciphering key and the applicable GEA ciphering algorithm according to the stored Ciphering
Algorithm IE in the MS shall also be indicated to the LLC layer (see 3GPP TS 44.064 [78a]).

In the case of an established UMTS security context, before any initial GMM message is sent in the new cell in A/Gb
mode, the GMM layer in the MS shall notify the LLC layer if ciphering shall be used or not. If ciphering shall be used,
then the GPRS GSM ciphering key or GPRS GSM Kc128 and the applicable GEA ciphering algorithm according to the
stored Ciphering Algorithm IE in the MS shall also be indicated to the LLC layer (see 3GPP TS 44.064 [78a]). If the
network has selected a GEA-algorithm that requires a 128-bit ciphering key, then the ME shall apply a GPRS GSM
Kc128 derived from the GPRS UMTS ciphering key and the GPRS UMTS integrity key of the established UTMS
security context as specified in 3GPP TS 33.102 [5a].

   NOTE:      A USIM with UMTS security context, passes the GPRS UMTS ciphering key, the GPRS UMTS integrity
              key and the derived GPRS GSM ciphering key to the ME independent on the current radio access being
              UTRAN or GERAN.

At an inter-system change from A/Gb mode to Iu mode, ciphering and integrity may be started (see

4.7.8         Identification procedure
The identification procedure is used by the network to request an MS to provide specific identification parameters to the
network e.g. International Mobile Subscriber Identity, International Mobile Equipment Identity (see
3GPP TS 23.003 [10]). For the presentation of the IMEI, the requirements of 3GPP TS 42.009 [5] apply.

4.7.8.1          Identification initiation by the network
The network initiates the identification procedure by transferring an IDENTITY REQUEST message to the MS and
starts the timer T3370. The IDENTITY REQUEST message specifies the requested identification parameters in the
identity type information element.

4.7.8.2          Identification response by the MS
An MS shall be ready to respond to an IDENTITY REQUEST message at any time.

Upon receipt of the IDENTITY REQUEST message the MS sends back an IDENTITY RESPONSE message. The
IDENTITY RESPONSE message shall contain the identification parameters as requested by the network.

4.7.8.3          Identification completion by the network
Upon receipt of the IDENTITY RESPONSE the network shall stop timer T3370.

4.7.8.3a         Abnormal cases in the MS
   (a) Requested identity is not available:

       If the MS cannot encode the requested identity in the IDENTITY RESPONSE message, e.g. because no valid
       SIM is available, then it shall encode the identity type as "No identity".

4.7.8.4          Abnormal cases on the network side
The following abnormal cases can be identified:

   a) Lower layer failure

      Upon detection of a lower layer failure before the IDENTITY RESPONSE is received, the network shall abort
      any ongoing GMM procedure.

   b) Expiry of timer T3370

      The identification procedure is supervised by the network by the timer T3370. The network shall, on the first
      expiry of the timer T3370, retransmit the IDENTITY REQUEST message and reset and restart the timer T3370.
      This retransmission is repeated four times, i.e. on the fifth expiry of timer T3370, the network shall abort the
      identification procedure and any ongoing GMM procedure.

   c) Collision of an identification procedure with a GPRS attach procedure

      If the network receives an ATTACH REQUEST message before the ongoing identification procedure has been
      completed and no GPRS attach procedure is pending on the network (i.e. no ATTACH ACCEPT/REJECT
      message has still to be sent as an answer to an ATTACH REQUEST message), the network shall proceed with
      the GPRS attach procedure.

   d) Collision of an identification procedure with a GPRS attach procedure when the identification procedure has
      been caused by a GPRS attach procedure

      If the network receives an ATTACH REQUEST message before the ongoing identification procedure has been
      completed and a GPRS attach procedure is pending (i.e. an ATTACH ACCEPT/REJECT message has to be sent
      as an answer to an earlier ATTACH REQUEST message), then:

      -   If one or more of the information elements in the ATTACH REQUEST message differs from the ones
          received within the previous ATTACH REQUEST message, the network shall proceed with the GPRS attach
          procedure; or

      -   If the information elements do not differ, then the network shall not treat any further this new ATTACH
          REQUEST.

   d1) Collision of an identification procedure with an MS initiated GPRS detach procedure

      GPRS detach containing cause "power off":

          If the network receives a DETACH REQUEST message before the ongoing identification procedure has been
          completed, the network shall abort the identification procedure and shall progress the GPRS detach
          procedure.

      GPRS detach containing other causes than "power off":

          If the network receives a DETACH REQUEST message before the ongoing identification procedure has been
          completed, the network shall complete the identification procedure and shall respond to the GPRS detach
          procedure as described in subclause 4.7.4.

   e) Collision of an identification procedure with a routing area updating procedure

      If the network receives a ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message before the ongoing identification
      procedure has been completed, the network shall progress both procedures.

   f) Collision of an identification procedure with a service request procedure

      If the network receives a SERVICE REQUEST message before the ongoing identification procedure has been
      completed, the network shall progress both procedures.

4.7.9         Paging procedure

4.7.9.1          Paging for GPRS services
In A/Gb mode, paging is used by the network to identify the cell the MS has currently selected, or to prompt the mobile
to re-attach if necessary as a result of network failure. If the MS is not GPRS attached when it receives a paging for
GPRS services, the MS shall ignore the paging.

In Iu mode, paging is used by the network to request the establishment of PS signalling connection or to prompt the
mobile to re-attach if necessary as a result of network failure. If the MS is not GPRS attached when it receives a paging
for GPRS services, the MS shall ignore the paging.

4.7.9.1.1            Paging for GPRS services using P-TMSI
The network shall initiate the paging procedure for GPRS services using P-TMSI when GMM signalling messages or
user data is pending to be sent to the MS while the mobile reachable timer is running. The network may page only
GPRS MSs which are GMM-REGISTERED and identified by a local P-TMSI.

In Iu mode, for the MS using eDRX, the network initiates the paging procedure when the paging trigger is received
within the paging time window. If the paging trigger is received outside the paging time window, the network initiates
the paging procedure at T time ahead of the beginning of the next paging time window.

   NOTE:      T time is a short time period based on implementation. The operator can take possible imperfections in
              the synchronization between the CN and the MS into account when choosing T time.

In Iu mode, to initiate the procedure the GMM entity in the network requests the lower layer to start paging (see
3GPP TS 25.331 [23c] and 3GPP TS 25.413 [19c]) and shall start the timer:

   -   T3315 for this paging procedure, if the network accepted to use eDRX for the MS.

   -   Otherwise T3313 for this paging procedure.

In Iu mode, if the network starts the timer T3315, the network shall set the timer T3315 to a value smaller than the value
of timer T3-RESPONSE (see 3GPP TS 29.274 [16D] for further details on timer T3-RESPONSE).

In Iu mode, the GMM entity in the network may provide the lower layer with a list of CSG IDs, including the CSG IDs
of both the expired and the unexpired subscriptions. If there is a PDN connection for emergency bearer services
established, the GMM entity in the network shall not provide the list of CSG IDs to the lower layer.

Upon reception of a paging indication, the MS shall stop the timer T3346, if running, and:

   -   initiate a service request procedure to respond to the paging, the MS shall set the service type to "paging
       response" in the SERVICE REQUEST message (see 3GPP TS 24.007 [20], 3GPP TS 23.060 [74],
       3GPP TS 25.331 [23c] and 3GPP TS 25.413 [19c]); or

   -   initiate a routing area update procedure as specified in subclauses 4.7.5.1 and 4.7.5.2.1.

If the paging request for GPRS services was received during an ongoing MS initiated GMM specific procedure, then the
MS shall progress the GMM specific procedure, and the network shall proceed with the GMM specific procedure.

In A/Gb mode, to initiate the procedure the GMM entity requests the RR sublayer to start paging (see
3GPP TS 44.018 [84], 3GPP TS 44.060 [76]), and shall start the timer:

3GPP TS 24.008 version 15.8.0 Release 15                  250                        ETSI TS 124 008 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


   -   T3315 for this paging procedure, if the network accepted to use eDRX for the MS.

   -   Otherwise T3313 for this paging procedure.

In A/Gb mode, if the network starts the timer T3315, the network shall set the timer T3315 to a value smaller than the
value of timer T3-RESPONSE (see 3GPP TS 29.274 [16D] for further details on timer T3-RESPONSE).

In A/Gb mode, upon reception of a paging indication, the MS shall respond to the paging with any LLC frame (see
3GPP TS 44.064 [78a], 3GPP TS 24.007 [20], 3GPP TS 23.060 [74]).

At intersystem change, an MS not having the READY timer running in A/Gb mode or an MS in PMM-IDLE mode in
Iu mode, being paged in a different access network as when it last sent user data or signalling message, uses the
ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message as paging response, i.e. the routing area updating procedure shall be
performed instead according to the selective routing area updating procedure.

The network shall stop the timer for the paging procedure (i.e. either timer T3313 or timer T3315) when a response is
received from the MS.

Upon expiry ofthe timer T3313, the network may re-initiate paging.

Upon expiry of the timer T3315, the network shall abort the paging procedure and shall proceed as specified in
3GPP TS 23.060 [74].

In Iu mode, when a response is received from the MS, the network shall change from PMM-IDLE mode to PMM-
CONNECTED mode.

In A/Gb mode, when a response different from an LLC NULL frame is received from the MS, the network shall start
the READY timer.

4.7.9.1.2            Paging for GPRS services using IMSI
Paging for GPRS services using IMSI is an abnormal procedure used for error recovery in the network.

The network may initiate paging using IMSI if the P-TMSI is not available due to a network failure.

In Iu mode, to initiate the procedure the GMM entity in the network requests the lower layer to start paging (see
3GPP TS 25.331 [23c] and 3GPP TS 25.413 [19c]).

In A/Gb mode, to initiate the procedure the GMM entity in the network requests the RR sublayer to start paging (see
3GPP TS 44.018 [84], 3GPP TS 44.060 [76]).

Upon reception of a paging indication for GPRS services using IMSI, the MS shall stop the timer T3346, if it is
running, locally deactivate any active PDP context(s), MBMS context(s) and locally detach from GPRS. The local
detach includes deleting any RAI, P-TMSI, P-TMSI signature and GPRS ciphering key sequence number stored, setting
the GPRS update status to GU2 NOT UPDATED and changing state to GMM-DEREGISTERED. The MS shall stop all
timers T3396 that are running.

If S1 mode is supported by the MS, the MS shall in addition handle the EMM parameters EMM state, EPS update
status, last visited registered TAI, TAI list, GUTI and KSIASME as specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 [120] for the case when
a paging for EPS services using IMSI is received.

In Iu mode, when an MS receives a paging request for GPRS services using the IMSI from the network before an MS
initiated GMM specific procedure has been completed, then the MS shall abort the GMM specific procedure, and the
MS shall proceed according to the description in this clause.

After performing the local detach, the MS shall then perform a GPRS attach or combined GPRS attach procedure.

After performing the attach, the MS should activate PDP context(s) to replace any previously active PDP context(s).
The MS should also perform the procedures needed in order to activate any previously active multicast service(s).

   NOTE 1: In some cases, user interaction may be required and then the MS cannot activate the PDP and MBMS
           context(s) automatically.

   NOTE 2: The MS does not respond to the paging except with the Attach Request. Hence timers T3313 and T3315
           in the network are not used when paging with IMSI.




                                                          ETSI
3GPP TS 24.008 version 15.8.0 Release 15                   251                        ETSI TS 124 008 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


   NOTE 3: Paging without DRX parameters may require a considerable extension of the paging duration.

   NOTE 4: Paging without using eDRX parameters may result in the paging with IMSI not to be received by the MS
           for which eDRX has been negotiated or may require a considerable extension of the paging duration.

4.7.9.2           Paging for non-GPRS services
The network may initiate the paging procedure for non-GPRS services when the MS is IMSI attached for non-GPRS
services.

In Iu mode, to initiate the procedure the GMM entity requests the lower layer to start paging (see 3GPP TS 25.331 [23c]
and 3GPP TS 25.413 [19c]) for non-GPRS services.

In A/Gb mode, to initiate the procedure the GMM entity requests the RR sublayer to start paging (see
3GPP TS 44.018 [84] and 3GPP TS 44.060 [76] for non-GPRS services).

The MS identity used for paging shall be the allocated TMSI if acknowledged by the MS, otherwise the IMSI.


4.7.10        Receiving a GMM STATUS message by a GMM entity
If the MS receives a GMM STATUS message no state transition and no specific action shall be taken as seen from the
radio interface, i.e. local actions are possible. The actions to be taken on receiving a GMM STATUS message in the
network are an implementation dependent option.


4.7.11        Void

4.7.12        GMM Information procedure
The GMM information message support is optional in the network. The MM information procedure may be invoked by
the network at any time during an established GMM context.

4.7.12.1          GMM information procedure initiation by the network
The GMM information procedure consists only of the GMM INFORMATION message sent from the network to the
mobile station. During an established GMM context, the network may send none, one, or more GMM INFORMATION
messages to the mobile station. If more than one GMM INFORMATION message is sent, the messages need not have
the same content.

4.7.12.2          GMM information procedure in the mobile station
When the mobile station (supporting the GMM information message) receives an GMM INFORMATION message, it
shall accept the message and optionally use the contents to update appropriate information stored within the mobile
station.

If the mobile station does not support the GMM information message the mobile station shall ignore the contents of the
message and return an GMM STATUS message with cause #97.


4.7.13        Service Request procedure (Iu mode only)
The purpose of this procedure is to transfer the PMM mode from PMM-IDLE to PMM-CONNECTED mode, and/or to
assign radio access bearer in case of PDP contexts are activated without radio access bearer assigned. In latter case, the
PMM mode may be PMM-IDLE mode or may alternatively be the PMM-CONNECTED mode if the MS requires radio
access bearer re-establishment. This procedure is used for;

   -   the initiation of CM layer service (e.g. SM or SMS) procedure from the MS in PMM-IDLE mode,

   -   the network to transfer down link signalling,

   -   uplink (in PMM-IDLE or PMM CONNECTED) and downlink (only in PMM-IDLE) user data,

   -   counting the number of mobile stations in a cell which are interested in a specific MBMS service.



                                                          ETSI
3GPP TS 24.008 version 15.8.0 Release 15                   252                        ETSI TS 124 008 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


   -   requesting the establishment of a point-to-point Radio Bearer for receiving a MBMS service.

For downlink transfer of signalling or user data in PMM-IDLE mode, the trigger is given from the network by the
paging request procedure, which is out of scope of the present document.

For pending downlink user data in PMM-CONNECTED mode, the re-establishment of radio access bearers for all
active PDP contexts is done without paging.

For counting the number of mobile stations in PMM-IDLE mode interested in a specific MBMS service, the trigger is
given from the network by the MBMS notification procedure (see 3GPP TS 25.331 [23c]).

For establishing a point-to-point radio bearer to allow MBMS service, the trigger is given from the RRC determining
this need from the MBMS control parameters broadcasted by the network (see 3GPP TS 25.331 [23c]).

Service type can take either of the following values; "signalling", "data", "paging response", "MBMS multicast service
reception" or "MBMS broadcast service reception". Each of the values shall be selected according to the criteria to
initiate the Service request procedure.

If the MS is triggered to send a Service Request message for both MBMS multicast service and MBMS broadcast
service simultaneously, the MS shall include a Service Type indicating "MBMS multicast service reception".

The criteria to invoke the Service request procedure are when:

   a) the MS has any signalling messages except GMM messages (e.g. for SM or SMS) to be sent to the network in
      PMM-IDLE mode (i.e., no secure PS signalling connection has been established). In this case, the service type
      shall be set to "signalling".

   b) the MS, either in PMM-IDLE or PMM-CONNECTED mode, has pending user data to be sent, no radio access
      bearer is established for the corresponding PDP context, and timer T3319 (see subclause 4.7.13.3) is not running
      or, optionally, if timer T3319 is running and the flag in the Uplink data status IE for this PDP context has not
      been set in the last Service Request. The procedure is initiated by an indication from the lower layers (see
      3GPP TS 24.007 [20]). In this case, the service type shall be set to "data".

   c) the MS receives a paging request using P-TMSI for PS domain from the network in PMM-IDLE mode. In this
      case, the service type shall be set to "paging response".

   d) the MS is in PMM-IDLE mode or PMM-CONNECTED, receives an MBMS notification for an MBMS
      multicast service for which the MS has activated an MBMS context or for an MBMS broadcast service which
      has been selected for reception locally by upper layers in the MS, and is prompted by the contents of the
      notification to establish a PS signalling connection (see 3GPP TS 25.346 [110]). In this case, the service type
      shall be set to "MBMS multicast service reception" or "MBMS broadcast service reception", respectively.

   e) the MS in PMM-IDLE mode or PMM-CONNECTED, determines from the broadcast MBMS control parameters
      that there is a need to establish a point-to-point Radio Bearer to enable MBMS reception (see
      3GPP TS 25.346 [110]). In this case, the service type shall be set to "MBMS multicast service reception" or
      "MBMS broadcast service reception", respectively.

If one of the above criteria to invoke the Service request procedure is fulfilled, then the Service request procedure may
only be initiated by the MS when the following conditions are fulfilled:

   -   its GPRS update status is GU1 UPDATED and the stored RAI is equal to the RAI of the current serving cell; and

   -   no GMM specific procedure is ongoing (see subclause 4.1.1.1).

If a GMM specific procedure is ongoing at the time a request from CM sublayer, the RRC or the RABM (see
3GPP TS 24.007 [20]) is received and the ATTACH REQUEST or ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message
has been sent, then, depending on implementation, the MS shall abort the received request or delay it until the GMM
specific procedure is completed. If the ATTACH REQUEST or ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message has
not been sent, the MS may indicate "follow-on request pending" in the message (i.e. the MS wishes to prolong the
established PS signalling connection after the GMM specific procedure). Then, the MS shall delay the Service request
procedure until the GMM specific procedure is completed.

If the network indicates "follow-on proceed" in the ATTACH ACCEPT or ROUTING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT
message and the MS has a service request pending, the MS shall react depending on the service type. If the service type
is:



                                                          ETSI
3GPP TS 24.008 version 15.8.0 Release 15                    253                        ETSI TS 124 008 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


   -   "signalling": the MS shall abort the Service request procedure and send the pending signalling messages
       immediately;

   -   "data": the MS shall immediately perform the pending Service request procedure using the current PS signalling
       connection;

   -   "paging response": the MS shall abort the Service request procedure. No further specific action is required from
       the MS.

If the network indicates "follow-on proceed" and the MS has no service request pending, then no specific action is
required from the MS. As an implementation option, the MS may start timer T3340 as described in subclause 4.7.1.9 if
no user plane radio access bearers are set up.

If the network indicates "no follow-on proceed" in the ATTACH ACCEPT or ROUTING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT
message, the MS shall not initiate the pending Service request procedure until the current PS signalling connection is
released.

   NOTE:      The "follow-on proceed" indication was not defined in earlier versions of the protocol. A network that is
              compliant with the earlier versions of the protocol will always encode the respective bit as zero, i.e. as
              "follow-on proceed", even if it does not prolong the PS signalling connection.

After completion of a Service request procedure but before re-establishment of radio access bearer, if the PDP and
MBMS context status information elements are included, then the network shall deactivate all those PDP and MBMS
contexts locally (without peer to peer signalling between the MS and the network), which are not in SM state PDP-
INACTIVE on network side but are indicated by the MS as being in state PDP-INACTIVE.

After completion of a Service request procedure, the pending service is resumed and uses then the connection
established by the procedure. If the service type is indicating "data", then the radio access bearers for all activated PDP
contexts are re-established by the network, except for those activated PDP contexts having maximum bit rate value set
to 0 kbit/s for both uplink and downlink and as an option those which have no pending user data. The re-establishment
of radio access bearers for those PDP contexts is specified in subclause 6.1.3.3.

A service request attempt counter is used to limit the number of service request attempts and no response from the
network. The service request attempt counter shall be incremented as specified in subclause 4.7.13.5.

The service request attempt counter shall be reset when:

   -   an attach or combined attach procedure is successfully completed;

   -   a normal or periodic routing area updating or a combined routing area updating procedure is successfully
       completed; or

   -   a service request procedure is successfully completed.

4.7.13.1          Service Request procedure initiation
The MS initiates the Service request procedure by sending a SERVICE REQUEST message. The timer T3317 shall be
started after the SERVICE REQUEST message has been sent and state GMM-SERVICE-REQUEST-INITIATED is
entered. The message SERVICE REQUEST shall contain the P-TMSI and the Service type shall indicate either "data",
"signalling", "paging response", "MBMS multicast service reception" or "MBMS broadcast service reception". The MS
shall not issue another Service request when the MS is in state GMM-SERVICE-REQUEST-INITIATED

If the PDP context status information element is included in the SERVICE REQUEST message, then the network shall
deactivate all those PDP contexts locally (without peer to peer signalling between the MS and the network) which are
not in SM state PDP-INACTIVE on the network side, but are indicated by the MS as being in state PDP-INACTIVE.

If the MBMS context status information element is included in the SERVICE REQUEST message, then the network
shall deactivate all those MBMS contexts locally (without peer to peer signalling between the MS and network) which
are not in SM state PDP-INACTIVE on the network side, but are indicated by the MS as being in state PDP-
INACTIVE. If no MBMS context status information element is included, then the network shall deactivate all MBMS
contexts locally which are not in SM state PDP-INACTIVE on the network side.

For a Service Request of type "data", the MS may include the Uplink data status information element in the SERVICE
REQUEST message. The Uplink data status information indicates which preserved PDP contexts have pending uplink
data to be sent. If the Uplink data status information element is included in the SERVICE REQUEST message with



                                                           ETSI

service type "data", the network may use this information to determine which of the RABs for the preserved PDP
contexts to re-establish.

4.7.13.2         GMM common procedure initiation
The network may initiate GMM common procedures, e.g. the GMM identification or the GMM authentication and
ciphering procedure, depending on the received information such as GPRS ciphering key sequence number and P-
TMSI.

4.7.13.3         Service request procedure accepted by the network
If the SERVICE REQUEST message was sent in PMM-IDLE mode, the indication from the lower layers that the
security mode control procedure is completed shall be treated as a successful completion of the procedure. The service
request attempt counter shall be reset, timer T3317 shall be stopped, and the MS enters GMM-REGISTERED state and
PMM-CONNECTED mode.

If the SERVICE REQUEST message was sent in PMM-CONNECTED mode, then the reception of the SERVICE
ACCEPT message shall be treated as a successful completion of the procedure. The timer T3317 shall be stopped and
the MS remains in PMM-CONNECTED mode.

Upon reception of the SERVICE REQUEST message, if the EMM Combined UE Waiting Flag is 'true', the SGSN shall
complete the procedure and perform a detach procedure for non-GPRS services only as described in subclause 4.7.4.2.

If the SERVICE REQUEST message was sent in a CSG cell and the CSG subscription has expired or was removed for
a MS, but the MS has a PDN connection for emergency bearer services established, the network shall accept the
SERVICE REQUEST message and deactivate all non-emergency PDP contexts by initiating PDP context deactivation
procedure. The PDP contexts for emergency services shall not be deactivated.

At successful completion of a service request procedure with Service type "data", the MS shall start timer T3319. The
timer T3319 shall be stopped when the MS returns to PMM-IDLE mode or when the network releases the radio access
bearer of any active PDP context. The MS shall not issue another Service Request with service type "data" while timer
T3319 is running unless the Service request is being generated from a PDP context for which the flag in the Uplink data
status IE has not been set in the last Service Request.

The network may indicate a value for timer T3319 in the ATTACH ACCEPT or ROUTING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT
messages. The last provided value of T3319 shall be used by the MS. If the information element T3319 value is not
included in the ATTACH ACCEPT or ROUTING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT messages, the default value shall be
used. If the T3319 value received by the MS contains an indication that the timer is deactivated or the timer value is
zero, then the MS shall use the default value.

If the PDP context status information element is included in the Service Accept, then the MS shall deactivate locally
(without peer to peer signalling between the MS and the network) all that PDP contexts which are not in SM state PDP-
INACTIVE on MS side but are indicated by the Network as being in state PDP-INACTIVE. If there is a default PDP
context among the PDP contexts to be deactivated, an MS supporting S1 mode shall locally deactivate all PDP contexts
associated to the same PDP address and APN as the default PDP context without peer-to-peer SM signalling to the
network; an MS not supporting S1 mode may apply the same behaviour.

If the MBMS context status information element is included in the SERVICE ACCEPT message, then the MS shall
deactivate all those MBMS contexts locally (without peer to peer signalling between the MS and network) which are
not in SM state PDP-INACTIVE in the MS, but are indicated by the network as being in state PDP-INACTIVE. If no
MBMS context status information element is included, then the MS shall deactivate all those MBMS contexts locally
which are not in SM state PDP-INACTIVE in the MS.

If a service request is received from an MS with a LIPA PDN connection, and if:

   -   a L-GW Transport Layer Address is provided by the lower layer together with the service request, and the
       GGSN address associated with the PDP context of the LIPA PDN connection is different from the provided L-
       GW Transport Layer Address (see 3GPP TS 25.413 [19c]); or

   -   no L-GW Transport Layer Address is provided together with the service request by the lower layer,

then the SGSN explicitly deactivates all PDP contexts associated with the LIPA PDN connection by initiating the PDP
context deactivation procedure (see subclause 6.1.3.4.2).

If a service request is received from an MS with a SIPTO at the local network PDN connection, the following different
cases can be distinguished:

   1) if the PDN connection is a SIPTO at the local network PDN connection with collocated L-GW and if:

        -   a SIPTO L-GW Transport Layer Address is provided by the lower layer together with the service request,
            and the GGSN address associated with the PDP context of the SIPTO at the local network PDN connection is
            different from the provided SIPTO L-GW Transport Layer Address (see 3GPP TS 25.413 [19c]); or

        -   no SIPTO L-GW Transport Layer Address is provided together with the service request by the lower layer,

   2) if the PDN connection is a SIPTO at the local network PDN connection with stand-alone GW and if:

        -   a LHN-ID value is provided by the lower layer together with the service request, and the LHN-ID stored in
            the PDP context of the SIPTO at the local network PDN connection is different from the provided LHN-ID
            value (see 3GPP TS 25.413 [19c]); or

        -   no LHN-ID value is provided together with the service request by the lower layer,

then the SGSN explicitly deactivates all PDP contexts associated with the SIPTO at the local network PDN connection
by initiating the PDP context deactivation procedure (see subclause 6.1.3.4.2).

4.7.13.4          Service request procedure not accepted by the network
If the Service request cannot be accepted, the network returns a SERVICE REJECT message to the mobile station.

Based on local policies or configurations in the network, if the network determines to change the periodic routing area
update timer (T3312), or if the network determines to change the PSM usage or the value of the timer T3324 in the MS
for which PSM is allowed by the network, the network may return a SERVICE REJECT with the cause #10 "implicitly
detached" to the MS.

If the service request for mobile originated services is rejected due to general NAS level mobility management
congestion control, the network shall set the GMM cause value to #22 "congestion" and assign a back-off timer T3346.

An MS that receives a SERVICE REJECT message containing a reject cause other than GMM cause value #25 or the
message is integrity protected, shall reset the service request attempt counter, shall stop the timer T3317.

If the SERVICE REJECT message containing GMM cause value #25 was received without integrity protection, then
the MS shall discard the message.

The MS shall then take different actions depending on the received reject cause value:

   #3          (Illegal MS); or

   #6          (Illegal ME);

   -    The MS shall set the GPRS update status to GU3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED (and shall store it according to
        subclause 4.1.3.2) and enter the state GMM-DEREGISTERED. Furthermore, it shall delete any P-TMSI, P-
        TMSI signature, RAI and GPRS ciphering key sequence number and shall consider the SIM/USIM as invalid for
        GPRS services until switching off or the SIM/USIM is removed. If the message has been successfully integrity
        checked by the lower layers and the MS maintains a counter for "SIM/USIM considered invalid for GPRS
        services", then the MS shall set this counter to MS implementation-specific maximum value.

   -    A GPRS MS operating in MS operation mode A or B shall in addition set the update status to U3 ROAMING
        NOT ALLOWED, shall delete any TMSI, LAI and ciphering key sequence number. If the MS is operating in
        MS operation mode A and an RR connection exists, the MS shall abort the RR connection, unless an emergency
        call is ongoing. The SIM/USIM shall be considered as invalid also for non-GPRS services until switching off or
        the SIM/USIM is removed or the timer T3245 expires as described in subclause 4.1.1.6. If the message has been
        successfully integrity checked by the lower layers and the MS maintains a counter for "SIM/USIM considered
        invalid for non-GPRS services", then the MS shall set this counter to MS implementation-specific maximum
        value.

        If S1 mode is supported in the MS, the MS shall handle the EMM parameters EMM state, EPS update status,
        GUTI, last visited registered TAI, TAI list and KSI as specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 [120] for the case when the
        service request procedure is rejected with the EMM cause with the same value.

        number. The SIM/USIM shall be considered as invalid for GPRS services until switching off or the SIM/USIM

        by the lower layers and the MS maintains a counter for "SIM/USIM considered invalid for GPRS services", then
        the MS shall set this counter to MS implementation-specific maximum value.

        A GPRS MS operating in MS operation mode A or B which is already IMSI attached for CS services is still
        IMSI attached for CS services in the network.

        A GPRS MS operating in MS operation mode A or B in network operation mode I shall then proceed with the
        appropriate MM specific procedure.

   NOTE 1: Optionally the MS starts the timer T3340 as described in subclause 4.7.1.9.

        The MS shall set the GPRS update status to GU3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED (and shall store it according to
        subclause 4.1.3.2) and shall delete any P-TMSI, P-TMSI signature, RAI and GPRS ciphering key sequence
        number. The new GMM state is GMM-DEREGISTERED.

        The MS shall set the update status to U3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED, shall delete any TMSI, LAI and
        ciphering key sequence number. If the MS is operating in MS operation mode A and an RR connection exists,
        the MS shall abort the RR connection, unless an emergency call is ongoing. The SIM/USIM shall be considered
        as invalid for GPRS and non-GPRS services until switching off or the SIM/USIM is removed. If the message has
        been successfully integrity checked by the lower layers and the MS maintains a counter for "SIM/USIM
        considered invalid for GPRS services", then the MS shall set this counter to MS implementation-specific
        maximum value. If the message has been successfully integrity checked by the lower layers and the MS
        maintains a counter for "SIM/USIM considered invalid for non-GPRS services", then the MS shall set this
        counter to MS implementation-specific maximum value.

   -    The MS shall set the GPRS update status to GU2 NOT UPDATED (and shall store it according to
        subclause 4.1.3.2), enter the state GMM-DEREGISTERED, and shall delete any P-TMSI, P-TMSI signature,
        RAI and GPRS ciphering key sequence number. If the rejected request was not for initiating a PDN connection
        for emergency bearer services, the MS may subsequently, automatically initiate the GPRS attach procedure.

        If S1 mode is supported in the MS, the MS shall handle the EMM parameters EMM state, EPS update status,
        GUTI, last visited registered TAI, TAI list and KSI as specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 [120] for the case when the
        service request procedure is rejected with the EMM cause with the same value.

   # 10    (Implicitly detached);

   -    A GPRS MS operating in MS operation mode B in network operation mode I is IMSI detached for both GPRS
        and CS services.

        A GPRS MS operating in MS operation mode A in network operation mode I is detached for GPRS services.If
        no RR connection exists then the MS is also IMSI detached for the CS services.

   -    The MS shall change to state GMM-DEREGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE. If the rejected request was not for

   b) detach locally, if not detached already, attempt GPRS attach for emergency bearer services.

4.7.13.5          Abnormal cases in the MS
The following abnormal cases can be identified:

   a) Access barred because of access class control, EAB or ACDC

       If the service request procedure is started in response to a paging request from the network, access class barring,
       EAB or ACDC is not applicable.

       The service request procedure shall not be started. The MS stays in the current serving cell and applies normal
       cell reselection process. The service request procedure may be started by CM layer if it is still necessary, i.e.
       when access is granted or because of a cell change.

       If access is barred because of access class control, the service request is initiated due to a request from upper
       layers for PS signalling connection, ACDC is applicable to the request and the MS supports ACDC, then the
       service request procedure shall be started.

       If access is barred for a certain ACDC category, and if the service request is initiated due to a request from upper
       layers for PS signalling connection for a higher ACDC category and the MS supports ACDC, then the service
       request procedure shall be started.

       If an access request for an uncategorized application is barred due to ACDC , and if the service request is
       initiated due to a request from upper layers for PS signalling connection for a certain ACDC category and the
       MS supports ACDC, then the service request procedure shall be started.

   b) Lower layer failure without "Extended Wait Time" received from lower layers before the security mode control
      procedure is completed, SERVICE ACCEPT or SERVICE REJECT message is received

       The procedure shall be aborted except in the following implementation option cases b.1, b.2 and b.3.

   b.1) Release of PS signalling connection in Iu mode (i.e. RRC connection release) before the completion of the
       service request procedure

       The service request procedure shall be initiated again, if the following conditions apply:

          i) The original service request procedure was initiated over an existing PS signalling connection; and

          ii) No SECURITY MODE COMMAND message and no Non-Access Stratum (NAS) messages relating to
          the PS signalling connection were received after the SERVICE REQUEST message was transmitted.

   b.2) RR release in Iu mode (i.e. RRC connection release) with cause different than "Directed signalling
       connection re-establishment", for example, "Normal", or "User inactivity" (see 3GPP TS 25.331 [23c] and
       3GPP TS 44.118 [111])

      The service request procedure shall be initiated again, if the following conditions apply:

          i) The original service request procedure was initiated over an existing RRC connection and,

          ii) No SECURITY MODE COMMAND message and no Non-Access Stratum (NAS) messages relating to
          the PS signalling connection were received after the SERVICE REQUEST messge was transmitted.

   NOTE:     The RRC connection release cause different than "Directed signalling connection re-establishment" that
             triggers the re-initiation of the service request procedure is implementation specific.

   b.3) RR release in Iu mode (i.e. RRC connection release) with cause "Directed signalling connection re-
       establishment" (see 3GPP TS 25.331 [23c] and 3GPP TS 44.118 [111])

      The routing area updating procedure shall be initiated followed by a rerun of the service request procedure if the
      following condition applies:

          i) The service request procedure was not due to a rerun of the procedure due to "Directed signalling
          connection re-establishment".

   c) T3317 expired

      The MS shall enter GMM-REGISTERED state.

      If the MS is in PMM-IDLE mode then the MS shall increment the service request attempt counter, abort the
      procedure and release locally any resources allocated for the service request procedure. If the service request
      procedure is initiated to establish a PDN connection for emergency bearer services or the MS has a PDN
      connection for emergency bearer services established or the MS is an MS configured to use AC11 – 15 in
      selected PLMN, the service request counter shall not be incremented. If the service request attempt counter is
      greater than or equal to 5, the MS shall start timer T3325. The MS shall not attempt service request until expiry
      of timer T3325 unless:

      -   the service request is in response to paging from the network;

      -   the MS is an MS configured to use AC11 – 15 in selected PLMN;

      -   the service request is initiated to establish a PDN connection for emergency bearer services;

      -   the MS has a PDN connection for emergency bearer services established; or

      -   the MS is registered in a new PLMN.

      If the MS is in PMM-CONNECTED mode, then the procedure shall be aborted.

   d) SERVICE REJECT received, other causes than those treated in subclause 4.7.13.4, and cases of GMM cause
      values #22 and #25, if considered as abnormal cases according to subclause 4.7.13.4

      The procedure shall be aborted.

   e) Routing area update procedure is triggered

      If a cell change into a new routing area occurs and the necessity of routing area update procedure is determined
      before the security mode control procedure is completed, a SERVICE ACCEPT or SERVICE REJECT message
      has been received, the Service request procedure shall be aborted and the routing area updating procedure is
      started immediately. Follow-on request pending may be indicated in the ROUTING AREA UPDATE
      REQUEST for the service, which was the trigger of the aborted Service request procedure, to restart the pending
      service itself or the Service request procedure after the completion of the routing area updating procedure. If the
      Service type of the aborted SERVICE REQUEST was indicating "data", then the routing area update procedure
      may be followed by a re-initiated Service request procedure indicating "data", if it is still necessary. If the
      Service type was indicating "MBMS multicast service reception", or "MBMS broadcast service reception" the
      Service request procedure shall be aborted.

   f) Power off

      If the MS is in state GMM-SERVICE-REQUEST-INITIATED at power off, the GPRS detach procedure shall be
      performed.

3GPP TS 24.008 version 15.8.0 Release 15                 262                        ETSI TS 124 008 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


   g) Detach procedure collision

      GPRS detach containing detach type "re-attach required" or "re-attach not required":

          If the MS receives a DETACH REQUEST message from the network in state GMM-SERVICE-REQUEST-
          INITIATED, the GPRS detach procedure shall be progressed and the Service request procedure shall be
          aborted. If the GMM cause IE, in the DETACH REQUEST message, indicated a "re-attach required", the
          GPRS attach procedure shall be performed. If the DETACH REQUEST message contains detach type "re-
          attach not required" and GMM cause #2 "IMSI unknown in HLR", the MS will follow the procedure as
          described below for the detach type "IMSI detach".

      GPRS detach containing detach type "IMSI detach":

          If the MS receives a DETACH REQUEST message from the network in state GMM-SERVICE-REQUEST-
          INITIATED, the network and the MS shall progress both procedures.

   h) "Extended wait time" for PS domain from the lower layers

      The MS shall abort the service request procedure, enter state GMM-REGISTERED, and stop timer T3317 if still
      running.

      If the SERVICE REQUEST message contained the low priority indicator set to "MS is configured for NAS
      signalling low priority", the MS shall start timer T3346 with the "Extended wait time" value.

      In other cases the MS shall ignore the "Extended wait time".

      The MS stays in the current serving cell and applies normal cell reselection process. The service request
      procedure is started, if still necessary, when timer T3346 expires or is stopped.

   m) Timer T3346 is running

      The MS shall not start the service request procedure unless:

      -   the MS receives a paging; or

      -   the MS is an MS configured to use AC11 – 15 in selected PLMN; or

      -   the MS has a PDN connection for emergency bearer services established; or

      -   the MS is establishing a PDN connection for emergency bearer services; or

      -   the MS has a PDN connection established without the NAS signalling low priority indication or is
          establishing a PDN connection without the NAS signalling low priority indication, the timer T3302 and the
          timer T3311 are not running and the timer T3346 was started due to rejection of a NAS request message (e.g.
          ATTACH REQUEST, ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST or SERVICE REQUEST) which contained
          the low priority indicator set to "MS is configured for NAS signalling low priority".

      The MS stays in the current serving cell and applies normal cell reselection process. The service request
      procedure is started, if still necessary, when timer T3346 expires or is stopped.

4.7.13.6         Abnormal cases on the network side
The following abnormal cases can be identified:

   a) Lower layer failure

      If a low layer failure occurs before the security mode control procedure is completed, a SERVICE ACCEPT or
      SERVICE REJECT message has been sent to the MS, the network enters/stays in PMM-IDLE.

   b) Protocol error

      If the SERVICE REQUEST message is received with a protocol error, the network shall return a SERVICE
      REJECT message with one of the following reject causes:

      #96:   Mandatory information element error;




                                                         ETSI
3GPP TS 24.008 version 15.8.0 Release 15                   263                       ETSI TS 124 008 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


       #99:   Information element non-existent or not implemented;

       #100: Conditional IE error;

       #111: Protocol error, unspecified.

       The network stays in PMM-IDLE mode.

   c) More than one SERVICE REQUEST received and the procedure has not been completed (i.e., the security mode
      control procedure has not been completed or SERVICE ACCEPT, SERVICE REJECT message has not been
      sent)

       -   If one or more of the information elements in the SERVICE REQUEST message differs from the ones
           received within the previous SERVICE REQUEST message, the previously initiated Service request
           procedure shall be aborted and the new Service request procedure shall be progressed;

       -   If the information elements do not differ, then the network shall continue with the previous Service request
           procedure and shall not treat any further this SERVICE REQUEST message.

   d) ATTACH REQUEST received before the security mode control procedure has been completed or an SERVICE
      ACCEPT or an SERVICE REJECT message has been sent

       If an ATTACH REQUEST message is received and the security mode control procedure has not been completed
       or an SERVICE ACCEPT or an SERVICE REJECT message has not been sent, the network may initiate the
       GMM common procedures, e.g. the GMM authentication and ciphering procedure. The network may e.g. after a
       succesful GMM authentication and ciphering procedure execution, abort the Service request procedure, the
       GMM context, PDP contexts and MBMS contexts, if any, are deleted and the new ATTACH REQUEST is
       progressed.

   e) ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message received before the security mode control procedure has been
      completed or an SERVICE ACCEPT or an SERVICE REJECT message has been sent

       If an ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message is received and the security mode control procedure has
       not been completed or an SERVICE ACCEPT or an SERVICE REJECT message has not been sent, the network
       may initiate the GMM common procedures, e.g. the GMM authentication and ciphering procedure. The network
       may e.g. after a successful GMM authentication and ciphering procedure execution, abort the Service request
       procedure and progress the routing area update procedure.

   f) If the Service Type indicates ‘data’ and the network fails to re-establish some or all RAB(s) then the SGSN may
      determine if PDP Context Modification or PDP Context Deactivation should be initiated.
      The appropriate action is an operator choice and depends on the QoS profile of the PDP Context, and the Uplink
      data status.


4.7.14        Void

4.7.15        GMM eCall inactivity procedure
The GMM eCall inactivity procedure is applicable only to an eCall only mobile station (as determined by information
configured in USIM) that is capable of eCall over IMS and attached for GPRS services. The procedure shall be started
when:

   -   the mobile station is in PMM-IDLE mode (Iu mode) or packet idle mode;

   -   the mobile station is in MM IDLE state;

   -   the mobile station is in any GMM-REGISTERED substate except GMM-REGISTERED.NO-CELL-
       AVAILABLE or GMM-REGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH; and

   -   one of the following conditions applies:

       -   timer T3242 expires or is found to have already expired and timer T3243 is not running;

       -   timer T3243 expires or is found to have already expired and timer T3242 is not running; or

        -   timers T3242 and T3243 expire or have found to have already expired.

The mobile station shall then stop other running timers (e.g. T3311, T3312) and shall:

    -   if the mobile station is also attached for non-GPRS services and the network operates in network operation mode
        I, perform a combined GPRS detach procedure for GPRS and non-GPRS services;

    -   if the mobile station is also attached for non-GPRS services and the network operates in network operation mode
        II, perform a GPRS detach procedure for GPRS services and an IMSI detach procedure; and

    -   if the mobile station is not attached for non-GPRS services, perform a GPRS detach procedure for GPRS
        services.

The mobile station shall then enter MM Idle eCALL INACTIVE state, delete any LAI, TMSI, ciphering key sequence
number stored in the SIM/USIM, delete any RAI, P-TMSI, P-TMSI signature and GPRS ciphering key sequence
number stored, delete any GUTI, TAI list, last visited registered TAI, list of equivalent PLMNs, KSI and set the update
state to U4 Updating Disabled.

While in eCALL INACTIVE state, the mobile station shall behave as specified in subclause 4.4.7.



5              Elementary procedures for circuit-switched Call
               Control

5.1            Overview
5.1.1          General
This subclause describes the call control (CC) protocol, which is one of the protocols of the Connection Management
(CM) sublayer (see 3GPP TS 24.007 [20]).

Every mobile station must support the call control protocol. If a mobile station does not support any bearer capability at
all then it shall respond to a SETUP message with a RELEASE COMPLETE message as specified in subclause 5.2.2.2.

In Iu mode only, integrity protected signalling (see subclause 4.1.1.1.1 of the present document and in general, see
3GPP TS 33.102 [5a]) is mandatory. In Iu mode only, all protocols shall use integrity protected signalling. Integrity
protection of all CC signalling messages is the responsibility of lower layers. It is the network which activates integrity
protection. This is done using the security mode control procedure (3GPP TS 25.331 [23c] and 3GPP TS 44.118 [111]).

In the call control protocol, more than one CC entity are defined. Each CC entity is independent from each other and
shall communicate with the correspondent peer entity using its own MM connection. Different CC entities use different
transaction identifiers.

With a few exceptions the present document describes the call control protocol only with regard to two peer entities.
The call control entities are described as communicating finite state machines which exchange messages across the
radio interface and communicate internally with other protocol (sub)layers. This description is only normative as far as
the consequential externally observable behaviour is concerned.

Certain sequences of actions of the two peer entities compose "elementary procedures" which are used as a basis for the
description in this subclause. These elementary procedures may be grouped into the following classes:

    -   call establishment procedures;

    -   call clearing procedures;

    -   call information phase procedures;

    -   miscellaneous procedures.

The terms "mobile originating" or "mobile originated" (MO) are used to describe a call initiated by the mobile station.
The terms "mobile terminating" or "mobile terminated" (MT) are used to describe a call initiated by the network.

5.2           Call establishment procedures
Establishment of a call is initiated by request of upper layer in either the mobile station or the network; it consists of:

   -   the establishment of a CC connection between the mobile station and the network;

   -   the activation of the codec or interworking function.

Whenever it is specified in the present document clause 5 that the mobile station shall attach the user connection, this
means that the mobile station shall activate the codec or interworking function as soon as an appropriate channel is
available. The mobile station shall de-activate the codec or interworking function whenever an appropriate channel is no
longer available. As soon as an appropriate channel is (again) available, the codec or interworking function shall be re-
activated. If a new order to attach the user connection is received, the new order shall supersede the previous one.




                                                            ETSI
3GPP TS 24.008 version 15.8.0 Release 15                     276                        ETSI TS 124 008 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


A channel shall be considered as appropriate if it is consistent with the possibly negotiated bearer capability applicable
for the actual phase of the call. The mobile station shall not consider a channel as not appropriate because the type of
the channel (full rate/half rate) is not the preferred one. If:

   -   the user connection has to be attached but no appropriate channel is available for a contiguous time of 30
       seconds; or if

   -   the codec or interworking function is de-activated for a contiguous time of 30 seconds;

then the mobile station may initiate call clearing.

Upon request of upper layers to establish a call, restricting conditions for the establishment of the call are examined.
These restricting conditions concern the states of parallel CC entities and are defined elsewhere. If these restricting
conditions are fulfilled, the call establishment is rejected. Otherwise a CC entity in state U0, "null", is selected to
establish the call. It initiates the establishment by requesting the MM sublayer to establish an MM connection.

In Iu mode, if the lower layers indicate the release of a radio access bearer, whereas the corresponding call is still active,
the MS shall not automatically initiate the release of that call.


5.2.1         Mobile originating call establishment
The call control entity of the mobile station initiates establishment of a CC connection by requesting the MM sublayer
to establish a mobile originating MM connection and entering the "MM connection pending" state. There are two kinds
of a mobile originating call: basic call and emergency call. The request to establish an MM connection shall contain a
parameter to specify whether the call is a basic or an emergency call. This information may lead to specific qualities of
services to be provided by the MM sublayers. Timer T303 is started when the CM SERVICE REQUEST message is
sent.

For mobile stations supporting eMLPP basic calls may optionally have an associated priority level as defined in
3GPP TS 23.067 [88]. This information may also lead to specified qualities of service to be provided by the MM
sublayers.

While being in the "MM connection pending" state, the call entity of the mobile station may cancel the call prior to
sending the first call control message according to the rules given in subclause 4.5.1.7.

The mobile station supporting multicall that is initiating an emergency call shall release one or more existing call to
ensure the emergency call can be established if the multicall supported information stored in the mobile station
described in subclauses 5.2.1.2 and 5.2.2.1 indicates the network does not support multicall and some ongoing calls
exists.

Having entered the "MM connection pending" state, upon MM connection establishment, the call control entity of the
mobile station sends a setup message to its peer entity. This setup message is:

   -   a SETUP message, if the call to be established is a basic call, and

   -   an EMERGENCY SETUP message, if the call to be established is an emergency call.

   NOTE 1: The Extended Local Emergency Numbers List (see 3GPP TS 24.301 [120]) does not apply in this
           specification.

The mobile station then enters the "call initiated" state. Timer T303 is not stopped.

The setup message shall contain all the information required by the network to process the call. In particular, the:

   -   SETUP message shall contain the called party address information;

   -   EMERGENCY SETUP message shall contain the emergency category, if the emergency category is available at
       the MS.

If the mobile station supports multicall, it shall include the Stream Identifier (SI) information element. For the first call
i.e. when there are no other ongoing calls the SI value shall be 1.

For speech calls the mobile station shall indicate all codecs that it supports for UTRAN in the Supported Codec List
information element. Codecs for GERAN shall be indicated in the Bearer Capability information element, if this




                                                            ETSI
3GPP TS 24.008 version 15.8.0 Release 15                      277                         ETSI TS 124 008 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


information element is included. Additionally, if the mobile station supports codecs for GERAN and UTRAN, it shall
indicate the codecs for GERAN also in the Supported Codec List information element.

If the call is a redial attempt to switch from speech to multimedia or vice-versa, the SETUP message shall include the
Redial information element.

   NOTE 2: Redial attempt is defined in 3GPP TR 23.903: "Redial solution for voice-video switching"[115].

If the MS supports the enhanced network-initiated in-call modification procedure as specified in subclause 5.3.4.3, the
MS shall indicate this in the Call Control Capabilities IE in the SETUP message.

If timer T303 elapses in the "MM connection pending" state, the MM connection in progress shall be aborted and the
user shall be informed about the rejection of the call.

5.2.1.1            Call initiation
The "call initiated" state is supervised by timer T303.For normal MO calls, this timer will have already been started
after entering the "MM connection pending" state. For network-initiated MO calls this timer will be started in the recall
present state as defined in subclause 5.2.3.4

When the call control entity of the mobile station is in the "call initiated" state and if it receives:

   i) a CALL PROCEEDING message, it shall proceed as described in subclause 5.2.1.3;

   ii) an ALERTING message, it shall proceed as described in subclause 5.2.1.5;

   iii) a CONNECT message, it shall proceed as described in subclause 5.2.1.6;

   iv) a RELEASE COMPLETE message it shall proceed as described in subclause 5.2.1.2.

Abnormal case:

   -   If timer T303 elapses in the "call initiated" state before any of the CALL PROCEEDING, ALERTING,
       CONNECT or RELEASE COMPLETE messages has been received, the clearing procedure described in
       subclause 5.4 is performed.

5.2.1.2            Receipt of a setup message
In the "null" or "recall present" states, upon receipt of a setup message (a SETUP message or an EMERGENCY SETUP
message, see subclause 5.2.1.1), the call control entity of the network enters the "call initiated" state. It shall then
analyse the call information contained in the setup message.

In Iu mode, network shall include the SI received in the SETUP message into the RABid and send it back to the mobile
station. For RABid see 3GPP TS 25.413 [19c] and 3GPP TS 44.118 [111]. If the network receives the SETUP message
with no SI, the network shall set the SI value to 1.

   i) If, following the receipt of the setup message, the call control entity of the network determines that the call
      information received from the mobile station is invalid (e.g. invalid number), then the network shall initiate call
      clearing as defined in subclause 5.4 with one of the following cause values:

       #1      "unassigned (unallocated) number",

       #3      "no route to destination",

       # 22    "number changed",

       # 28    "invalid number format (incomplete number)".

   ii) If, following the receipt of the setup message, the call control entity of the network determines that a requested
       service is not authorized or is not available, it shall initiate call clearing in accordance with subclause 5.4.2 with
       one of the following cause values:

       #8      "operator determined barring",

       # 57    "bearer capability not authorized",

3GPP TS 24.008 version 15.8.0 Release 15                     278                      ETSI TS 124 008 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


       # 58   "bearer capability not presently available",

       # 63   "service or option not available, unspecified", or

       # 65   "bearer service not implemented".

   iii) Otherwise, the call control entity of the network shall either:

       -   send a CALL PROCEEDING message to its peer entity to indicate that the call is being processed; and enter
           the "mobile originating call proceeding" state;

       -   or: send an ALERTING message to its peer entity to indicate that alerting has been started at the called user
           side; and enter the "call received" state;

       -   or: send a CONNECT message to its peer entity to indicate that the call has been accepted at the called user
           side; and enter the "connect request" state.

       The call control entity of the network may insert bearer capability information element(s) in the CALL
       PROCEEDING message to select options presented by the mobile station in the Bearer Capability information
       element(s) of the SETUP message. The bearer capability information element(s) shall contain the same
       parameters as received in the SETUP except those presenting a choice. Where choices were offered, appropriate
       parameters indicating the results of those choices shall be included.

       The CALL_PROCEEDING message shall also contain the priority of the call in the case where the network
       supports eMLPP. Mobile stations supporting eMLPP shall indicate this priority level to higher sublayers and
       store this information for the duration of the call for further action. Mobile stations not supporting eMLPP shall
       ignore this information element if provided in a CALL PROCEEDING message.

   NOTE:      If the network supports only R98 or older versions of this protocol and the priority is not included in the
              CALL PROCEEDING message, this does not imply that the network does not support eMLPP.

   -   The CALL_PROCEEDING message shall contain the multicall supported information in the network call
       control capabilities in the case where the network supports multicall and there are no other ongoing calls to the
       MS. Mobile stations supporting multicall shall store this information until the call control state for all calls
       returns to null. Mobile stations not supporting multicall shall ignore this information if provided in a CALL
       PROCEEDING message. If the multicall supported information is not sent in the CALL_PROCEEDING
       message, the mobile station supporting multicall shall regard that the network doesn't support multicall.

The call control entity of the network having entered the "mobile originating call proceeding" state, the network may
initiate the assignment of a traffic channel according to subclause 5.2.1.9 (early assignment).

For speech calls, if the SETUP message or EMERGENCY SETUP message contains a Supported Codec List
information element, the network shall use this list to select the codec for UTRAN. If no Supported Codec List
information element is received, then for UTRAN the network shall select the default UMTS speech codec according to
subclause 5.2.1.11.

Codecs for GERAN shall be selected from the codecs indicated in the Supported Codec List information element or in
the Bearer Capability information element. If neither a Supported Codec List information element nor a Bearer
Capability information element is received, then for GERAN the network shall select GSM full rate speech version 1.

Codec information that does not apply to the currently serving radio access shall be used by the network if an inter-
system change occurs.

5.2.1.3           Receipt of a CALL PROCEEDING message
Having entered the "call initiated" state, when the call control entity of the mobile station receives a CALL
PROCEEDING message, it shall stop timer T303; start timer T310 unless

   -    the CALL PROCEEDING message contains a progress indicator IE specifying progress description #1, #2, or
        #64; or

   -    it has received a PROGRESS message containing a progress indicator IE specifying progress description #1, #2,
        or #64 prior to the CALL PROCEEDING message

and enter the "mobile originating call proceeding" state.

Abnormal case:

        If timer T310 elapses before any of the ALERTING, CONNECT or DISCONNECT messages has been received,
        the mobile station shall perform the clearing procedure described in subclause 5.4.

5.2.1.4           Notification of progressing mobile originated call
In this subclause, the term "interworking" is used only in the meaning of interworking with a network other than PLMN
or ISDN, not as interworking between PLMN and ISDN since this is the normal case. In this sense, PLMN and ISDN
are seen within the same environment, called the PLMN/ISDN environment.

5.2.1.4.1            Notification of interworking in connection with mobile originated call establishment
During call establishment, the call may leave a PLMN/ISDN environment; e.g., because of interworking with another
network, with a non-PLMN/ISDN user, or with non-PLMN/ISDN equipment within the called user's premises; the call
may also return to a PLMN/ISDN environment. When such situations occur, the network may send a progress indicator
information element to the calling mobile station either:

   a) in an appropriate call control message, if a state change is required (e.g. ALERTING or CONNECT); or,

   b) in the PROGRESS message, if no state change is appropriate.

This progress indicator information element shall contain one of the following progress description values:

   a) #1 "call is not end-to-end PLMN/ISDN; further call progress information may be available in-band".

   b) #2 "destination address is non-PLMN/ISDN".

   c) #4 "call has returned to PLMN/ISDN.

See also subclauses 5.5.1 and 5.5.6 for further reactions of the mobile station.

5.2.1.4.2             Call progress in the PLMN/ISDN environment
In order to inform the mobile station that the call is progressing in the PLMN/ISDN environment the network may send
a progress indicator information element to the calling mobile station either:

   a) in an appropriate call control message, if a state change is required (e.g., ALERTING or CONNECT); or

   b) in the PROGRESS message, if no state change is appropriate.

This progress indicator information element shall contain progress description value #32 "Call is end-to-end
ISDN/PLMN". See also subclause 5.5.6 for further reactions of the mobile station.

5.2.1.5           Alerting
Having entered the "mobile originating call proceeding" state, upon receiving an indication that user alerting has been
initiated at the called address, the call control entity of the network shall: send an ALERTING message to its peer entity
at the calling mobile station and enter the "call delivered" state.

When the call control entity of the mobile station in the "call initiated" state or "mobile originating call proceeding"
state receives an ALERTING message then, the call control entity of the mobile station shall stop timer T303 and T310
(if running) and shall enter the "call delivered" state. In this state:

   -   for speech calls: an alerting indication should be given to the user. If the mobile station has not attached the user
       connection then the mobile station shall internally generate an alerting indication. If the mobile station has
       attached the user connection then the network is responsible for generating the alerting indication and the mobile
       station need not generate one; and

   -   for multimedia calls: if the mobile station has not attached the user connection then the mobile station may
       internally generate an alerting indication. If the mobile station supports multimedia CAT during the alerting
       phase of a mobile originated multimedia call establishment, the network may request the mobile station to attach
       the user connection and setup a H.324 call and generate multimedia CAT as specified in subclause 5.3.6.4, in
       which case the mobile station need not generatean alerting tone.

Abnormal cases:

       On the mobile station side, if timer T303 or T310 expires, the call control entity of the mobile station shall
       initiate call clearing as described in subclause 5.4.

5.2.1.6           Call connected
Upon receiving an indication that the call has been accepted, the call control entity of the network shall: through
connect the traffic channel (including the connection of an interworking function, if required) and send a CONNECT
message to its peer entity at the calling mobile station; start timer T313 and enter the "connect indication" state.

This message indicates to the call control entity of the calling mobile station that a connection has been established
through the network.

   -    attach the user connection;

   -    return a CONNECT ACKNOWLEDGE message;

   -    stop any locally generated alerting indication (if applied);

   -    clear any H.324 call established to receive multimedia CAT during the alerting phase (if applied) , as specified in
        subclause 5.3.6.4

   -    stop timer T303 and T310 (if running);

   -    enter the "active" state.

Abnormal cases:

        On the mobile station side, if timer T303 or T310 expires, the call control entity of the mobile station shall
        initiate call clearing as described in subclause 5.4.

   NOTE:       The mobile station may have applied an additional internal alerting supervision which causes initiation of
               call clearing prior to the expiry of T303 or T310.

The call control of the network in the "connect indication" state, shall, upon receipt of a CONNECT ACKNOWLEDGE
message:

   -    stop timer T313 and enter the "active" state.

Abnormal cases:

        On the network side, if timer T313 elapses before a CONNECT ACKNOWLEDGE message has been received,
        the network shall perform the clearing procedure as described in subclause 5.4.

5.2.1.7            Call rejection
Upon receiving an indication that the network or the called user is unable to accept the call, the network shall initiate
call clearing at the radio interface to the mobile which originated the call, as described in subclause 5.4 using the cause
provided by the terminating network or the called user.

5.2.1.9            Traffic channel assignment at mobile originating call establishment
The mobile station supporting multicall includes the Stream Identifier (SI) in the SETUP message. The multicall
supporting network shall interprets the SI value as follows:

   a) Mobile station generates a new SI value at the initiation of an originating call, then a new traffic channel shall be
      assigned to the mobile originating call.

   b) Mobile station indicates an existing SI value, then the indicated traffic channel shall be used for the mobile
      originating call.

Mobile station supporting multicall shall never send an additional SETUP with indication that a new traffic channel is
requested to a network that does not support multicall.

It is a network dependent decision when to initiate the assignment of an appropriate traffic channel during the mobile
originating call establishment phase. Initiation of a suitable RR procedure to assign an appropriate traffic channel does
neither change the state of a call control entity nor affect any call control timer.

   NOTE:      During certain phases of such an RR procedure, transmission of CC and MM messages may be
              suspended, see 3GPP TS 44.018 [84], clause 3 and 3GPP TS 48.008 [85].

The assignment procedure does not affect any call control timer.

5.2.1.10          Call queuing at mobile originating call establishment
If an idle traffic channel is not available at the assignment instant, the network may place the traffic channel request in a
queue. Calls arriving when all positions in the queue are occupied shall be cleared by the network using the cause #34
"no circuit/channel available".

The maximum queuing interval is supervised by the network. The limit is a network dependent choice. In case the
network is not able to allocate a traffic channel within the queuing limit, the network will release the call using cause
#34 "no circuit/channel available".

Optionally, e.g. if eMLPP is used, the network may decide to pre-empt existing calls or to place the traffic channel
request at some preferential position within the queue.

Specific indications provided in the network to the remote user are a network dependent choice.

5.2.1.11          Speech Codec Selection
For speech calls, a mobile station implementing this version of the protocol shall indicate all codecs that it supports for
UTRAN in the Supported Codec List information element. Codecs for GERAN shall be indicated in the Bearer
Capability information element, if this information element is included. Additionally, if the mobile station supports
codecs for GERAN and UTRAN, it shall indicate the codecs for GERAN also in the Supported Codec List information
element.

If the network does not receive a Supported Codec List information element then for speech calls in UTRAN it shall
select the default UMTS speech codec.

For speech calls in GERAN, if the network does not receive a Supported Codec List information element nor a Bearer
Capability information element, the network shall select GSM full rate speech version 1.

The network shall determine the default UMTS speech codec by the following:

   i) If no GSM Speech Version codepoints are received in the Supported Codec List IE or in octet 3a etc. of the
      Bearer Capabilities IE then a "UMTS only" terminal is assumed and the default UMTS speech codec shall be
      UMTS_AMR.

   ii) If at least one GSM Speech Version codepoint is received in the Supported Codec List IE or in octet 3a etc. of
       the Bearer Capabilities IE then the ME supports GSM and UMTS and the default UMTS speech codec shall be
       UMTS_AMR_2.

   NOTE 1: In case (ii), if the call is set up in A/Gb or GERAN Iu mode by a R99 ME, call control in the core
           network may treat the ME as a "GSM only" ME. The default UMTS speech codec will only become
           relevant when an intersystem handover to UTRAN Iu mode is initiated by the radio access network, and
           can be determined when this procedure is started.

If the Supported Codec List IE is received, then the network shall use this list to select the codec for Iu mode and
indicate the selected codec to the ME via RANAP and RRC protocol in the NAS Synchronisation Indicator IE. See
3GPP TS 25.413 [19c], 3GPP TS 25.331 [23c] and 3GPP TS 44.118 [111].

The NAS Synchronisation Indicator IE shall be coded as the 4 least significant bits of the selected codec type (CoID)
defined in 3GPP TS 26.103 [83], subclause 6.3.

The network shall determine the preference for the selected codec type; codec type prioritisation is not provided by the
ME.

The ME shall activate the codec type received in the NAS Synchronisation Indicator IE.

3GPP TS 24.008 version 15.8.0 Release 15                    283                         ETSI TS 124 008 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


If the mobile station does not receive the NAS Synchronisation Indicator IE (RRC protocol)

   -   during setup of a speech call;

   -   during inter-system handover of a speech call from A/Gb or GERAN Iu mode to UTRAN Iu mode;

   -   during an in-call modification from data to speech; or

   -   during a SRVCC handover to UTRAN Iu mode,

then it shall select the UMTS_AMR_2 speech codec.

   NOTE 2: If the network does not support UMTS_AMR_2, it may activate the UMTS_AMR codec and indicate to
           the mobile station that it shall select UMTS_AMR_2. According to 3GPP TS 26.103 [83], subclause 5.4,
           no interworking problem will occur in this case.

If the mobile station has selected a speech codec for UTRAN Iu mode, it shall keep this codec until

   -   a new codec is requested by the network by sending a NAS Synchronisation Indicator IE (RRC protocol);

   -   a new codec is requested by the network during inter-system handover from UTRAN Iu mode to A/Gb or
       GERAN Iu mode; or

   -   an in-call modification from speech to data is performed.

For adaptive multirate codec types no indication of subsets of modes is supported in this protocol, from the mobile
station or to the mobile station. It is a pre-condition that the support of such codec types by the mobile station implicitly
includes all modes defined for that codec type.

5.2.1.12          Cellular Text telephone Modem (CTM) selection
The mobile station can send a CTM support indication in the Bearer Capability IE in call establishment messages to
inform the network of the use of CTM text in the call.

When the mobile station indicates speech and support of CTM text telephony, the network shall select a speech codec
and additionally CTM text telephony detection/conversion functions as specified in 3GPP TS 23.226 [92] and
3GPP TS 26.226 [93], if such functions are available.

   NOTE:      If CTM support is indicated by the mobile station, then it supports CTM text telephony together with any
              supported speech codec and for any supported radio access.


5.2.2         Mobile terminating call establishment
Before call establishment can be initiated in the mobile station, the MM connection must be established by the network.

5.2.2.1           Call indication
After the arrival of a call from a remote user, the corresponding call control entity in the network shall: initiate the MM
connection establishment according to clause 4 and enter the "MM connection pending" state. The request to establish
the MM connection is passed from the CM sublayer to the MM sublayer. It contains the necessary routing information
derived from the SETUP message.

Upon completion of the MM connection, the call control entity of the network shall: send the SETUP message to its
peer entity at the mobile station, start timer T303 and enter the "call present" state.

The SETUP message shall contain the multicall supported information in the network call control capabilities in the
case where the network supports multicall and there are no other ongoing calls to the MS. Mobile stations supporting
multicall shall store this information until the call control state for all calls returns to null. Mobile stations not
supporting multicall shall ignore this information if provided in a SETUP message. If the multicall supported
information is not sent in the SETUP message, the mobile station supporting multicall shall regard that the network
does not support multicall.

Upon receipt of a SETUP message, the mobile station shall perform compatibility checking as described in
subclause 5.2.2.2. If the result of the compatibility checking was compatibility, the call control entity of the mobile



                                                            ETSI

station shall enter the "call present" state. An incompatible mobile station shall respond with a RELEASE COMPLETE
message in accordance with subclause 5.2.2.3.4.

If there are no bearer capability IEs in the SETUP message, the network may provide information about the requested
service in the backup bearer capability IE.

If no response to the SETUP message is received by the call control entity of the network before the expiry of timer
T303, the procedures described in subclause 5.2.2.3.3 shall apply.




  Figure 5.6/3GPP TS 24.008 Mobile terminating call initiation and possible subsequent responses.


5.2.2.2           Compatibility checking
The mobile station receiving a SETUP message shall perform compatibility checking before responding to that SETUP
message. Annex B defines compatibility checking to be performed by the mobile station upon receiving a SETUP
message. For a backup bearer capability IE received with a SETUP message the mobile station shall not perform
compatibility checking as described in annex B.

5.2.2.3           Call confirmation

5.2.2.3.1             Response to SETUP
Having entered the "call present state" the call control entity of the mobile station shall - with the exception of the cases
described below - acknowledge the SETUP message by a CALL CONFIRMED message, and enter the "mobile
terminating call confirmed" state.

If the mobile station supports multicall, it shall include the Stream Identifier (SI) information element in the CALL
CONFIRMED message.

       If the mobile station is located in the network supporting multicall, it shall never include the SI that is in use and
       shall include with either of the following two values:

   -   SI="no bearer";

   -   SI=new value (not used by any of the existing bearers).

If the mobile station supporting multicall is located in the network not supporting multicall, it shall include the SI with
value 1.

The call control entity of the mobile station may include in the CALL CONFIRMED message to the network one or
two bearer capability information elements to the network, either preselected in the mobile station or corresponding to a
service dependent directory number (see 3GPP TS 29.007 [38]). The mobile station may also use the backup bearer
capability IE, if provided by the network, to deduce the requested service (see 3GPP TS 27.001 [36], subclause 8.3.3.1).
The mobile station may also include one or two bearer capabilities in the CALL CONFIRMED message to define the
radio channel requirements. In any case the rules specified in subclause 9.3.2.2 shall be followed.

   NOTE:      The possibility of alternative responses (e.g., in connection with supplementary services) is for further
              study.

For speech calls the mobile station shall indicate all codecs that it supports for UTRAN in the Supported Codec List
information element. Codecs for GERAN shall be indicated in the Bearer Capability information element, if this




                                                            ETSI
3GPP TS 24.008 version 15.8.0 Release 15                   285                          ETSI TS 124 008 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


information element is included. Additionally, if the mobile station supports codecs for GERAN and UTRAN, it shall
indicate the codecs for GERAN also in the Supported Codec List information element.

If the MS supports the enhanced network-initiated in-call modification procedure as specified in subclause 5.3.4.3, the
MS shall indicate this in the Call Control Capabilities IE in the CALL CONFIRMED message.

A busy MS which satisfies the compatibility requirements indicated in the SETUP message shall respond either with a
CALL CONFIRMED message if the call setup is allowed to continue or a RELEASE COMPLETE message if the call
setup is not allowed to continue, both with cause #17 "user busy".

If the mobile user wishes to refuse the call, a RELEASE COMPLETE message shall be sent with the cause #21 "call
rejected".

In the cases where the mobile station responds to a SETUP message with RELEASE COMPLETE message the mobile
station shall release the MM connection and enter the "null" state after sending the RELEASE COMPLETE message.

The network shall process the RELEASE COMPLETE message in accordance with subclause 5.4.

5.2.2.3.2             Receipt of CALL CONFIRMED and ALERTING by the network
The call control entity of the network in the "call present" state, shall, upon receipt of a CALL CONFIRMED message:
stop timer T303, start timer T310 and enter the "mobile terminating call confirmed" state.

In Iu mode, network shall include the SI received in the CALL CONFIRMED message into the RABid and send it back
to the mobile station. For RABid see 3GPP TS 25.413 [19c] and 3GPP TS 44.118 [111]. If the network receives the
CALL CONFIRMED message with no SI, the network shall set the SI value to 1.

For speech calls, if the CALL CONFIRMED message contains a Supported Codec List information element, the
network shall use this list to select the codec for UTRAN. If no Supported Codec List information element is received,
then for UTRAN the network shall select the default UMTS speech codec according to subclause 5.2.1.11.

Codecs for GERAN shall be selected from the codecs indicated in the Supported Codec List information element or in
the Bearer Capability information element. If neither a Supported Codec List information element nor a Bearer
Capability information element is received, then for GERAN the network shall select GSM full rate speech version 1.

Codec information that does not apply to the currently serving radio access shall be used by the network if an inter-
system change occurs.

The call control entity of the mobile station having entered the "mobile terminating call confirmed" state, if the call is
accepted at the called user side, the mobile station proceeds as described in subclause 5.2.2.5. Otherwise, if the signal
information element was present in the SETUP message user alerting is initiated at the mobile station side; if the signal
information element was not present in the SETUP message, user alerting is initiated when an appropriate channel is
available.

Here, initiation of user alerting means:

   -   the generation of an appropriate tone or indication at the mobile station; and

   -   sending of an ALERTING message by the call control entity of the MS to its peer entity in the network and
       entering the "call received" state.

The call control entity of the network in the "mobile terminated call confirmed" state shall, upon receipt of an
ALERTING message: send a corresponding ALERTING indication to the calling user; stop timer T310; start timer
T301, and enter the "call received" state.

In the "mobile terminating call confirmed" state or the "call received" state, if the user of a mobile station is User
Determined User Busy then a DISCONNECT message shall be sent with cause #17 "user busy". In the "mobile
terminating call confirmed" state, if the user of a mobile station wishes to reject the call then a DISCONNECT message
shall be sent with cause #21 "call rejected".

5.2.2.3.3             Call failure procedures
In case of abnormal behaviour the following call failure procedures apply:




                                                           ETSI
3GPP TS 24.008 version 15.8.0 Release 15                     286                        ETSI TS 124 008 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


   i. If the network does not receive any response to the SETUP message prior to the expiration of timer T303, then
      the network shall: initiate clearing procedures towards the calling user with cause #18 "no user responding"; and
      initiate clearing procedures towards the called mobile station in accordance with subclause 5.4.4 using cause
      #102 "recovery on timer expiry".

   ii. If the network has received a CALL CONFIRMED message, but does not receive an ALERTING, CONNECT
       or DISCONNECT message prior to the expiration of timer T310, then the network shall:

       -   initiate clearing procedures towards the calling user with cause #18 "no user responding"; and

       -   initiate clearing procedures towards the called MS in accordance with subclause 5.4.4 using cause #102
           "recovery on timer expiry".

   iii. If the network has received an ALERTING message, but does not receive a CONNECT or DISCONNECT
        message prior to the expiry of timer T301 (or a corresponding internal alerting supervision timing function), then
        the network shall: initiate clearing procedures towards the calling user with cause #19 "user alerting, no answer";
        and initiate clearing procedures towards the called mobile station in accordance with subclause 5.4.4, using
        cause #102 "recovery on timer expiry" or using cause #31 "normal, unspecified".

   NOTE:      The choice between cause #31 and cause #102 may have consequences on indications generated by the
              mobile station, see 3GPP TS 22.001 [8a].

5.2.2.3.4              Called mobile station clearing during mobile terminating call establishment
See subclause 5.4.2.

5.2.2.4           Notification of interworking in connection with mobile terminating call
                  establishment
In this subclause, the term "interworking" is used only in the meaning of interworking with a network other than PLMN
or ISDN, not as interworking between PLMN and ISDN since this is the normal case. In this sense, PLMN and ISDN
are seen within the same environment, called the PLMN/ISDN environment.

During call establishment the call may enter an PLMN/ISDN environment, e.g., because of interworking with another
network, with a non-PLMN/ISDN user, or with non-PLMN/ISDN equipment within the calling or called user's
premises. When this occurs, the network may include a progress indicator information element to be included in the
SETUP message to be sent to the called mobile station specifying progress description value:

   a) #1 "call is not end-to-end PLMN/ISDN; further call progress information may be available in-band" or

   b) #3 "origination address is non-PLMN/ISDN".

See also subclause 5.5.1 for further reactions of the mobile station.

5.2.2.5           Call accept
In the "mobile terminating call confirmed" state or the "call received" state, the call control entity in the mobile station
indicates acceptance of a mobile terminating call by:

   -   sending a CONNECT message to its peer entity in the network;

   -   starting Timer T313; and

   -   entering the "connect request" state.

If the call control entity of the mobile station has indicated "No Bearer" as the SI value in the CALL CONFIRMED
message, it shall assign the SI value and include the SI information element in the CONNECT message. Otherwise the
SI information element shall not be included in the CONNECT message.

5.2.2.6           Active indication
In the "mobile terminated call confirmed" state or in the "call received" state, the call control entity of the network shall,
upon receipt of a CONNECT message: through connect the traffic channel (including the connection of an interworking

function, if required), stop timers T310, T303 or T301 (if running); send a CONNECT ACKNOWLEDGE message to
its peer entity at the mobile station of the called user; initiate procedures to send a CONNECT message towards the
calling user and enter the "active" state.

In the "connect request" state, the call control entity of the mobile station shall, upon receipt of a CONNECT
ACKNOWLEDGE message: stop timer T313 and enter the "active" state.

When timer T313 expires prior to the receipt of a CONNECT ACKNOWLEDGE message, the mobile station shall
initiate clearing in accordance with subclause 5.4.3.

5.2.2.7             Traffic channel assignment at mobile terminating call establishment
After receiving the SETUP message, the mobile station supporting multicall may either require a new traffic channel or
reuse an existing traffic channel.

If a mobile station in the network supporting multicall requires a new traffic channel, it shall:

   -   send a CALL CONFIRMED message including the SI indicating a new value, not used by any of the existing
       traffic channels.

If a mobile station in the network supporting multicall does not require a new traffic channel, it shall:

   -   send a CALL CONFIRMED message including the SI equal to "no bearer".

After the mobile station has send the CALL CONFIRMED with SI="no bearer", the SI value in the CONNECT
message will tell to the network if a user requests a new traffic channel or one of the existing ones will be re-uesd.

If a new traffic channel is requested by the user, the mobile station in the network supporting multicall shall:

   -   send a CONNECT message containing the SI with a new value, not used by any existing traffic channel.

If the user decides that an existing traffic channel will be reused, the mobile station in the network supporting multicall
shall:

   -   send a CONNECT message with an SI indicating an existing value used by an existing traffic channel.

It is a network dependent decision when to initiate the assignment of a traffic channel during the mobile terminating call
establishment phase.

Initiation of the assignment phase does not directly change the state of a CC entity nor affect any call control timer, but
may have some secondary effects (see e.g. subclause 5.2.2.3.2).

5.2.2.8             Call queuing at mobile terminating call establishment
The principles described in subclause 5.2.1.10 apply accordingly.

   NOTE:      The interworking to the fixed network has to fulfil the network specific requirements.

5.2.2.9             User connection attachment during a mobile terminating call
For speech calls:

       The mobile station shall attach the user connection at latest when sending the connect message.

For data calls:

       The mobile station shall attach the user connection when receiving the CONNECT ACKNOWLEDGE message
       from the network.

5.2.2.10             Speech Codec Selection
The principles described in subclause 5.2.1.11 apply accordingly.

5.2.2.11             Cellular Text telephone Modem (CTM) selection
   The principles described in subclause 5.2.1.12 apply accordingly.


5.2.3         Network initiated MO call $(CCBS)$
The procedures of subclause 5.2.3 are mandatory for mobile stations supporting "Network initiated MO call".

   NOTE:          The behaviour of a mobile station that does not support "Network initiated MO call" is described in
                  clause 4.

5.2.3.1              Initiation
Before call establishment can be initiated in the mobile station, the MM connection shall be established by the network.

After the arrival of an appropriate stimulus (for example a Remote User Free Indication), the corresponding call control
entity in the network shall initiate the MM connection establishment according to clause 4, enter the "CC connection
pending" state and start timer T331. The request to establish the MM connection is passed from the CM sublayer to the
MM sublayer. It contains the necessary routing information derived from the received stimulus.

Upon completion of the MM connection, the call control entity of the mobile station shall send a START CC message
to its peer entity in the network. The mobile station shall then enter the "Wait for network information" state and start
timer T332.

If the network receives a START CC message while in the "CC connection pending" state, the network stops T331,
sends the CC-ESTABLISHMENT message, starts timer T333 and enters the "CC-establishment present" state.

The MM connection establishment may be unsuccessful for a variety of reasons, in which case the MM sublayer in the
network will inform the CC entity in the network with an indication of the reason for the failure. The CC entity shall
then stop all running timers, enter the "Null" state and inform all appropriate entities within the network.

If timer T331 expires, the network shall abort the MM connection establishment attempt, stop all running CC timers,
enter the "Null" state and inform all appropriate entities within the network.

5.2.3.2              CC-Establishment present
In the "CC establishment present" state, the mobile station, upon receipt of the CC-ESTABLISHMENT message, shall
stop timer T332.

The CC-ESTABLISHMENT message contains information which the mobile station shall use for the subsequent
SETUP message (if any) related to this CC-ESTABLISHMENT.

The CC-ESTABLISHMENT message shall contain the Setup Container IE.

If no CC-ESTABLISHMENT message is received by the call control entity of the mobile station before the expiry of
timer T332, then the mobile station shall initiate clearing procedures towards the network using a RELEASE
COMPLETE message with cause #102 "recovery on timer expiry" and proceed in accordance with subclause 5.4.2.

Upon receipt of a CC-ESTABLISHMENT message the mobile station shall perform checks on the Setup Container IE
in order to align the contained information with the mobile's present capabilities and configuration. The "recall
alignment procedure" is defined later on in this subclause.

If the recall alignment procedure has succeeded, the call control entity of the Mobile Station shall:

       -   form and store the SETUP message for sending later in the "Recall present" state,

       -   acknowledge the CC-ESTABLISHMENT message with a CC-ESTABLISHMENT CONFIRMED message,

       -   start timer T335, and

       -   enter the "CC-establishment confirmed" state.

Exception:

       A busy mobile station which has successfully performed the recall alignment procedure shall respond with a CC-
       ESTABLISHMENT CONFIRMED message with cause #17 "user busy", and proceed as stated above.

For speech calls the mobile station shall indicate all codecs that it supports for UTRAN in the Supported Codec List
information element of the CC-ESTABLISHMENT CONFIRMED message. Codecs for GERAN shall be indicated in
the Bearer Capability information element. Additionally, if the mobile station supports codecs for GERAN and
UTRAN, it shall indicate the codecs for GERAN also in the Supported Codec List information element.

A mobile station, for which the recall alignment procedure failed, shall respond with a RELEASE COMPLETE
message in accordance with subclause 5.4.2 with the appropriate cause code as indicated in the description of the recall
alignment procedure.

The SETUP message is constructed from the Setup Container IE received in the CC ESTABLISHMENT MESSAGE.
The mobile station shall assume that the Setup Container IE contains an entire SETUP message with the exception of
the Protocol Discriminator, Transaction ID and Message Type elements. The mobile station may assume that the
contents of the Setup Container IE are the same as were sent from the subscriber in a previous SETUP message of the
mobile originating call establishment attempt. The mobile station shall copy the Setup Container to the SETUP message
and not modify the contents except as defined in the recall alignment procedure and as defined in exceptions below. The
mobile station shall not add other Information Elements to the end of the SETUP message.

Exceptions:

       Bearer Capability IE(s), HLC IE(s) and LLC IE(s) (including Repeat Indicator(s), if there are 2 bearer
       capabilities), and the Supported Codec List IE require handling as described in the recall alignment procedure
       below.

       If the CC Capabilities in the Setup Container IE is different to that supported by the mobile station, the mobile
       station shall modify the CC Capabilities in the SETUP message to indicate the true capabilities of the mobile
       station.

       Facility IE(s) and SS Version IE(s) require handling as described in the recall alignment procedure.

       Stream Identifier IE requires handling as described in the recall alignment procedure.

If no response to the CC-ESTABLISHMENT message is received by the call control entity of the network before the
expiry of timer T333, then the network shall initiate clearing procedures towards the called mobile station using a
RELEASE COMPLETE message with cause #102 "recovery on timer expiry" and inform all appropriate entities within
the network, proceeding in accordance with subclause 5.4.2.

Basic service group alignment:

The mobile station shall check that the Bearer Capability, HLC and LLC and Repeat Indicator fields, which are
embedded in the Setup Container IE, match a basic service group supported by the mobile station.

If this check fails, then the recall alignment procedure has failed. The mobile station shall use the cause #88
"incompatible destination" afterwards.

Otherwise, the mobile station is allowed to alter the content within the Bearer Capability, HLC and LLC Information
Elements (e.g. the speech codec version(s), the data rate, the radio channel requirement) provided that the basic service
group is not changed. Furthermore, for speech calls the mobile station is allowed to add or remove the Supported Codec
List Information Element, or to alter the contents of this information element dependent on the codecs supported by the
mobile station. The result shall be that the mobile station has derived Bearer Capability, HLC, LLC, and Supported
Codec List Information Elements, which it can use for a later call setup according to its configuration and capabilities.

Facility alignment:

       This only applies if the Setup Container contains 1 or more Facility IEs. Each Facility IE within the Setup
       Container will be associated with the common SS Version IE, if present. The handling for each Facility IE is
       defined below. The mobile station shall align each facility IE contained in the Setup Container. The rules defined
       in 3GPP TS 24.010 [21] also apply.

The Facility IE is encoded as 'simple recall alignment', 'advanced recall alignment' or 'recall alignment not essential'
(see 3GPP TS 24.010 [21]). If the encoding indicates, that

   -   a simple recall alignment is required, the mobile station shall copy the Facility IE and the common SS version IE
       from the Setup Container to the SETUP message without modifying the content.

   -   an advanced recall alignment is required, the mobile station must recognise and support the operation defined in
       the facility. If the mobile station does not recognise or support the operation, then the recall alignment procedure
       has failed and the mobile station shall use the cause #29 "facility rejected" in the subsequent rejection of the CC
       establishment request.

   -   the recall alignment is not essential, then the facility operation is not an essential part of the SETUP. If the MS
       does not recognise the operation then the SS Version IE and Facility IE are discarded, and NOT copied into the
       SETUP message.

   NOTE:      A mobile station may include a Facility IE without an associated SS Version IE. This would indicate that
              the SS operation is encoded using Phase 1 protocols.

Further details on Facility handling are given in 3GPP TS 24.010 [21].

Stream identifier alignment:

The mobile station shall check whether the Stream Identifier field is contained in the Setup Container or not.

If the Stream Identifier is contained in the Setup Container, the mobile station shall behave as one of the following.

   -   the mobile station re-assign the Stream Identifier value, and modify the Stream Identifier field.

   -   the mobile station remove the Stream Identifier field.

If the Stream Identifier is not contained in the Setup Container, the mobile station may behave as follows.

   -   the mobile station assign the Stream Identifier value, and add the Stream Identifier IE to the end of the SETUP
       message.

5.2.3.3           CC-Establishment confirmation
The call control entity of the network in the "CC-establishment present" state, shall, upon receipt of a CC-
ESTABLISHMENT CONFIRMED message, stop timer T333 and enter the "CC-establishment confirmed" state.

For speech calls, if the ESTABLISHMENT CONFIRMED message contains a Supported Codec List information
element, the network shall use this list to select the codec for UMTS. If no Supported Codec List information element is
received, then for UMTS the network shall select the default UMTS speech codec according to subclause 5.2.1.11.

Codecs for GERAN shall be selected from the codecs indicated in the Supported Codec List information element or in
the Bearer Capability information element. If neither a Supported Codec List information element nor a Bearer
Capability information element is received, then for GERAN the network shall select GSM full rate speech version 1.

Codec information that does not apply to the currently serving radio access shall be used by the network if an inter-
system change occurs.

In the "CC-establishment confirmed" state, the network sends a RECALL message. This message initiates user alerting
and also shall include the Facility IE (providing additional information to be presented to the user for notification). The
network starts timer T334 and enters the 'recall present' state.

Upon reception of the RECALL message the Mobile station stops T335 and enters the "recall present" state.

5.2.3.4           Recall present
In the "recall present" state, the call control entity in the mobile station waits for acceptance of the Recall by the user.
Once confirmation is received, the mobile station indicates acceptance of a recall by

   -   sending a SETUP message to its peer entity in the network;

   -   starting Timer T303; and

   -   entering the "call initiated" state and proceeding as described in subclause 5.2.1.1.

The MS shall ensure that the contents of the Bearer Capability IE(s) and Supported Codec List IE sent in the SETUP
message are the same as the Bearer Capability IE(s) and Supported Codec List IE in the previous CC-
ESTABLISHMENT CONFIRMED message related to this Network Initiated MO Call.

In the "recall-present" state, if the user of a mobile station is User Determined User Busy then a RELEASE
COMPLETE message shall be sent with cause #17 "user busy" In the "recall-present" state. If the user of a mobile
station wishes to reject the recall then a RELEASE COMPLETE message shall be sent with cause #21 "call rejected".

In either case, the mobile shall release the connection in accordance with subclause 5.4.2

On receipt of the SETUP message in the "recall present" state, the network shall stop timer T334 and proceed as
specified in subclause 5.2.1.2.

If the call control entity of the network does not receive a SETUP message before the expiry of timer T334, then the
network shall send a RELEASE COMPLETE message to the mobile using cause #102 "recovery on timer expiry",
release the MM connection, enter the "null" state and shall inform all appropriate entities within the network.

                  establishment
It is a network dependent decision whether or not to initiate the assignment of a traffic channel during the "CC-
establishment confirmed" state.


5.2.4         Call establishment for SRVCC or vSRVCC

5.2.4.1           General
Before call establishment for SRVCC or vSRVCC can be initiated in the mobile station, the MM connection must be
established by the network.

At PS to CS domain change from S1 mode or Iu mode due to SRVCC handover or vSRVCC handover (see
3GPP TS 23.216 [126]), the RR sublayer in the MS indicates to the MM layer if a voice only SRVCC handover or a
voice and video SRVCC handover was completed successfully. At reception of this indication, the MS that supports
SRVCC or vSRVCC shall establish an MM connection as specified in subclause 4.5.1.8 and either proceeds with
subclause 5.2.4.2 if the indication is that voice only SRVCC was completed successfully or proceeds with
subclause 5.2.4.2a if the indication is that voice and video SRVCC was completed successfully.

5.2.4.2           Call activation for SRVCC

   -   supports SRVCC and the MS has a voice media stream previously carried over the PS domain that is handed
       over to the CS domain via SRVCC; or

   -   supports SRVCC or vSRVCC and the MS has a voice media stream and a video media stream of a single session
       previously in S1 mode carried over the PS domain and only the voice media stream is handed over to the CS
       domain via SRVCC

state (defined in 3GPP TS 24.084 [28]) to "idle" and indicate the call establishment to upper layers. The MS and the
network shall locally set the TI value of the call to "000" and the TI flag value as in mobile terminated call. If a single
voice media stream is handed over and:

   -   if the session is on hold, the setting of the auxiliary state (as defined in 3GPP TS 24.083 [27]) is described in
       3GPP TS 24.237 [136]; and

   -   when the call control entity enters the "call delivered" state, if prior to SRVCC the MS in the PS domain was
       receiving media for the session subjected to SRVCC handover; and

   -   when the call control entity enters the "mobile originating call proceeding" state, if prior to SRVCC the MS in
       the PS domain was receiving media for the session subjected to SRVCC handover.

   NOTE:      The attachment of the user connection prior to entering the "active" state allows the network to provide
              in-band tones and announcements to the UE.

For vSRVCC handover, the mobile station shall attach the user connection when the call control entity enters the
"active" state.

For SRVCC or vSRVCC handover to a speech call, the principles of speech codec selection are described in
subclause 5.2.1.11.

For vSRVCC handover to a circuit-switched multimedia call, further requirements are specified in subclause 5.3.6.6.

5.2.4.4           State verification
The network may check the call and auxiliary states of its peer entity as specified in subclause 5.5.3.1 when the PS to
CS access transfer is complete.


5.3           Signalling procedures during the "active" state
5.3.1         User notification procedure
The mobile terminating user notification procedure allows the network to notify a mobile station of any appropriate
call-related event during the "active" state of a call. The procedure consists in the network sending a NOTIFY message
to the mobile station. No state change occurs at any of the interface sides following the sending or the receipt of this
message (but an appropriate indication may optionally be generated in the mobile station).

The mobile originating notification procedure allows the mobile station to notify the remote user of any appropriate
call-related event during the "active" state of a call by sending a NOTIFY message containing a notification indicator to
the network; upon receipt of this message, the network sends a NOTIFY message containing the same notify indicator
to the other user involved in the call. No state change occurs at any of the interface sides following the sending or the
receipt of this message.


5.3.2         Call rearrangements
Call rearrangements on the radio interface are not supported by explicit messages (e.g. SUSPEND and RESUME
messages as defined in ETSI ETS 300 102-1 [70]). However if a remote non-PLMN user initiates call rearrangements,
the network shall inform the mobile station by means of a NOTIFY message. In a similar way the mobile station can
inform the network about rearrangements by sending a NOTIFY message (e.g. change of user equipment connected to
the mobile station).


5.3.3         Codec Change Procedure
During a speech call in UMTS, if a mobile station supports more than one UMTS codec, the network can change the
UMTS codec via RRC procedures. In order to request the mobile station to change the codec, the network shall send the
new selected codec type in the NAS Synchronisation Indicator IE (RRC protocol), see subclause 5.2.1.11.


5.3.4         Support of Dual Services
The behaviour described in this subclause is used to realize the following required services throughout subclause 5.3.4.
The mobile station is not obliged to support the network originated in-call modification procedure. In that case, the
mobile station shall, when receiving a MODIFY message, treat the message as unknown and react as described in
subclause 8.4. If the mobile station is already prepared to support the procedure in both directions, it shall act as
described in this subclause.

       Alternate Speech/Group 3 fax (Teleservice 61 according to 3GPP TS 22.003 [4]).

5.3.4.1           Service Description
This circuit switched service allows the two users on a point-to-point connection to use the connection between them
for different information transfer during the same call, but not at the same time.

If the negotiation during call establishment leads to the recognition of the above mentioned services, the in-call
modification procedure is allowed to be executed within the current call by changing from one call mode to the other.

In some cases the in-call modification procedure makes it necessary to change the channel configuration by allocating a
new channel and in other cases to change channel configuration parameters while keeping the previously allocated
channel. This change is determined by the network, which initiates either the channel assignment procedure, handover
procedure or channel mode modify procedure (see clause 3).

The capability and the initial mode desired must be identified by the mobile station by identifying each mode of
operation with a separate information element during call establishment. Further the type of change between the modes
must be identified by means of the repeat indicator:

       mode 1 "alternate" mode 2.

5.3.4.2           Call establishment
For both mobile originating and mobile terminating calls, the normal call establishment procedures apply.

5.3.4.2.1             Mobile Originating Establishment
The service is requested by the originating mobile station by transferring a SETUP message to the network containing
the BC repeat indicator IE, the bearer capability 1 information element, and the bearer capability 2 information
element. The first mode of operation ("call mode") shall be indicated by the bearer capability 1 information element
and the second call mode by the bearer capability 2 information element.

A low layer compatibility may optionally be specified for each call mode in a low layer compatibility I and low layer
compatibility II information element. In that case:

   -   the SETUP message shall contain the LLC repeat indicator IE and both low layer compatibility I and low layer
       compatibility II information elements. The low layer compatibility I information element then corresponds to the
       bearer capability 1 information element and the low layer compatibility II information element to the bearer
       capability 2 information element;

   -   if no low layer compatibility specification applies for one of the two call modes, the corresponding low layer
       compatibility IE (low layer compatibility I or low layer compatibility II) shall indicate "not applicable";

   -   the LLC repeat indicator shall specify the same repeat indication as the BC repeat indicator IE.

Similarly, a high layer compatibility may optionally be specified for each call mode in a high layer compatibility i and
high layer compatibility ii information element. In that case:

   -   the SETUP message shall contain the HLC repeat indicator IE and both high layer compatibility i and high layer
       compatibility ii information elements. The high layer compatibility i information element then corresponds to the
       bearer capability 1 information element and the high layer compatibility ii information element to the bearer
       capability 2 information element;

   -   if no high layer compatibility specification applies for one of the two call modes, the corresponding high layer
       compatibility IE (high layer compatibility i or high layer compatibility ii) shall indicate "not applicable";

   -   the HLC repeat indicator shall specify the same repeat indication as the BC repeat indicator IE.

The receiving entity shall ignore whether the LLC repeat indicator IE or HLC repeat indicator are contained in the
message or not; it shall also ignore the repeat indication of an LLC repeat indicator IE or HLC repeat indicator IE. If
the low layer compatibility II IE is not contained in the message and the low layer compatibility I IE is contained in the
message, the receiving entity shall relate it to a call mode indicated in the message that does not specify speech (if any).
If the high layer compatibility ii IE is not contained in the message and the high layer compatibility i IE is contained in

the message, the receiving entity shall relate it to a call mode indicated in the message that does not specify speech (if
any).

The specific part of the network which is sensitive to the call mode shall examine each mode described in the bearer
capabilities included in the SETUP message by performing compatibility checking as defined in Annex B. If as a result
of this compatibility checking the network decides to reject the call, then the network shall initiate call clearing as
specified in subclause 5.4 with the following causes:

       a) #57 "bearer capability not authorized";

       b) #58 "bearer capability not presently available";

       c) #65 "bearer service not implemented";

       d) #70 "only restricted digital information bearer capability is available".

5.3.4.2.2             Mobile Terminating Establishment
The service is indicated to the called mobile station by a SETUP message coded in the same manner as in the mobile
originating call establishment. As specified for normal terminating call establishment, the service may be indicated by
the called mobile station in the CALL CONFIRMED message.

The destination mobile station shall perform the compatibility checking as defined in Annex B for both required modes
if indicated in the SETUP message. If as a result of compatibility checking the mobile station decides to reject the call,
the mobile station shall initiate call clearing according to the procedures of subclause 5.4 with one of the following
causes:

       a) #57 "bearer capability not authorized";

       b) #58 "bearer capability not presently available";

       c) #65 "bearer service not implemented";

       d) #88 "incompatible destination".

The mobile station may accept the call if the first mode indicated is free irrespective of whether the other mode is free
or busy.

5.3.4.3            Changing the Call Mode
In order to change the call mode, the following in-call modification procedures shall be used.

Either side of the radio interface may act as the requesting user to invoke the in-call modification.

Upon each successful completion of the in-call modification procedure, the call changes to the next mode negotiated
and agreed during the establishment phase of the call.

The in-call modification procedures are completely symmetrical at the radio interface.

5.3.4.3.1             Initiation of in-call modification
The procedure is initiated by the requesting originating side in the "active" state of the call. It shall send a MODIFY
message including the new mode to be changed to. The requesting originating side shall also start timer T323 and enter
the "mobile originating modify" state (mobile station side) or the "mobile terminating modify" state (network side). The
new mode given in the MODIFY message shall be one of those already negotiated and agreed during the establishment
phase of the call. If the data call direction is different from the direction of the call setup a reverse call setup direction IE
shall be included in the MODIFY message; otherwise this IE shall not be included.

If the in-call modification is originated by the mobile station, the mobile station shall reserve any internal resources
necessary to support the next call mode, stop sending Bm-channel information; and stop interpreting received Bm-
channel information according to the old call mode.




                                                             ETSI
3GPP TS 24.008 version 15.8.0 Release 15                   298                       ETSI TS 124 008 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


If the in-call modification is originated by the network, the network may reserve any internal resources necessary to
support the next call mode. The network shall stop sending Bm-channel information and stop interpreting received Bm-
channel information according to the old call mode at the latest when it changes the channel configuration.

Upon receipt of the MODIFY message, the destination side shall check to ensure that the requested call mode can still
be supported and if so, it shall initiate the reservation of any resources necessary to support the next call mode; start
T324 (mobile station side only) if the in-call modification procedure is triggered as a result of a service change from
speech to UDI/RDI multimedia modes; and enter the "mobile originating modify" (network side) or "mobile terminating
modify" state (mobile station side).

5.3.4.3.2            Successful completion of in-call modification
If the destination network/mobile station receives a MODIFY message with a new mode which is already the actual one
of the call the network/mobile station shall remain in the "active" state; send a MODIFY COMPLETE message with the
actual mode; and shall not initiate anything else.

If the requested mode is speech and if during call establishment the network received a Supported Codec List IE, the
network shall use this list to select the codec for UTRAN. If no Supported Codec List information element is received,
then for UTRAN the network shall select the default UMTS speech codec according to subclause 5.2.1.11.

Codecs for GERAN shall be selected from the codecs indicated in the Supported Codec List information element or in
the Bearer Capability information element. If neither a Supported Codec List information element nor a Bearer
Capability information element is received, then for GERAN the network shall select GSM full rate speech version 1.

If the Supported Codec List IE is received, then the network shall indicate the codec selected for Iu mode to the mobile
station via RANAP and RRC protocol in the NAS Synchronisation Indicator IE (see subclause 5.2.1.11).

If the in-call modification was originated by the mobile station, the mobile station and the network shall proceed as
follows:

       If the requested mode is not the actual one and can be supported by the network it shall change the channel
       configuration, if required, and step on to any internal resources necessary to support the next call mode. If the
       requested mode is a data or facsimile mode, it shall also perform the appropriate means to take the direction of
       the data call into account. After successful change of the channel configuration it shall start sending user
       information according to the next call mode and start interpreting received user channel information according to
       the next call mode; send a MODIFY COMPLETE message with the new call mode included and enter the
       "active" state (network side). If the MODIFY message had contained a reverse call setup direction IE, the same
       IE shall be included in the MODIFY COMPLETE message.

       Upon receipt of the MODIFY COMPLETE message the mobile station shall: initiate the alternation to those
       resources necessary to support the next call mode; stop timer T323; and enter the "active" state (mobile station
       side).

If the in-call modification was originated by the network, the mobile station and the network shall proceed as follows:

       If the requested mode is not the actual one and can be supported by the mobile station it shall reserve any
       internal resources necessary to support the next call mode.

   NOTE:      For a change from speech to a different call mode, user interaction may be required, before the mobile
              decides that the requested mode can be supported.

       If the requested mode is a data or facsimile mode, it shall also perform the appropriate means to take the
       direction of the data call into account. The mobile station shall send a MODIFY COMPLETE message with the
       new call mode included, stop timer T324 and enter the "active" state (mobile station side). If the MODIFY
       message had contained a reverse call setup direction IE, the same IE shall be included in the MODIFY
       COMPLETE message. If the old call mode is speech, the mobile station shall continue sending Bm-channel
       information and interpreting received Bm-channel information for speech until the network modifies its channel
       configuration.

       After receipt of the MODIFY COMPLETE message the network shall: reserve any internal resources necessary
       to support the next call mode, stop sending Bm-channel information, and stop interpreting received Bm-channel
       information according to the old call mode, unless these actions were already performed earlier. Furthermore, the
       network shall change the channel configuration, if required; after successful change of the channel configuration

       initiate the alternation to those resources necessary to support the next call mode; stop timer T323; and enter the
       "active" state (network side).

       The mobile station shall start sending user information according to the next call mode and start interpreting
       received user channel information according to the next call mode as soon as a suitable channel for the new
       mode is available.

In both cases:

       For an alternate speech/facsimile group 3 service (refer to subclause 5.3.4) the old resources may still be kept
       reserved.

       The reaction of the originating side if it had included a reverse call setup direction IE in the MODIFY message,
       but the destination side did not include the IE in the MODIFY COMPLETE message is implementation
       dependent.

5.3.4.3.3            Change of the channel configuration
In case the requested bearer capability cannot be supported by the current channel configuration the network shall
initiate the assignment procedure and change the channel configuration accordingly.

5.3.4.3.4            Failure of in-call modification

5.3.4.3.4.1              Network rejection of in-call modification

If the network cannot support the change to the requested call mode or if the change of the channel configuration fails
the network shall: release the resources which had been reserved for the alternation: send a MODIFY REJECT message
with the old bearer capability and with cause # 58 "bearer capability not presently available" to the initiating mobile
station; and enter the "active" state. If the change of the channel configuration fails, the network shall return to the
internal resources required for the old call mode.

Upon receipt of the MODIFY REJECT message with the old bearer capability the initiating mobile station shall: stop
timer T323; release any resources which had been reserved for the alternation; resume sending user channel information
according to the present call mode; resume interpreting received user channel information according to the present call
mode; and enter the "active" state.

5.3.4.3.4.2              Mobile station rejection of in-call modification

If the mobile station cannot support the change to the requested call mode, the mobile station shall: stop timer T324;
release any resources which had been reserved for the alternation; send a MODIFY REJECT message with the old
bearer capability and cause # 58 "bearer capability not presently available", and enter the "active" state.

Upon receipt of the MODIFY REJECT message the network shall: stop timer T323, release any resources which had
been reserved for the alternation.

5.3.4.3.4.3              Time-out recovery

Upon expiration of T323 in either the mobile station or the network the procedures for call clearing shall be initiated
(see subclause 5.4) with cause # 102 "recovery on timer expiry".

Upon expiration of T324 the mobile station shall: release any resources which had been reserved for the alternation;
send a MODIFY REJECT message with the old bearer capability and cause #58 "bearer capability not presently
available"; and enter the "active" state.

5.3.4.4           Abnormal procedures
If a MODIFY, MODIFY COMPLETE or MODIFY REJECT message is received in the "disconnect indication",
"disconnect request" (mobile station side only) or "release request" state then the received message shall be discarded
and no action shall be taken.

The user initiated service level up- and downgrading is applicable for non-transparent multislot data services, only. By
means of this procedure the user can request a change of the "maximum number of traffic channels" and/or "wanted air
interface user rate" parameters, to be assigned by the network.

5.3.5.1           Initiation of service level up- and downgrading
The procedure is initiated by the mobile station in the "active" state of the call. It shall:

       "wanted air interface user rate" parameters;

   -   not change any of the other, possibly negotiated, parameters of the bearer capability information element;

   -   start timer T323; and

   -   enter the "mobile originating modify" state.

Any internal resources necessary to support the next service parameters shall be reserved. If a dual service was
negotiated at call setup, the mobile station shall initiate the service level up- or down-grading only during the data phase
of the dual service.

Upon receipt of the MODIFY message, the network shall check if the indicated maximum number of traffic channels
can be supported and enter the "mobile originating modify" state.

the "wanted air interface user rate", or if the current used service is not a data service where up- and downgrading is
applicable, or if the receiver chooses not to grant the request, the network shall:

   -   send a MODIFY REJECT message with bearer capability negotiated at call setup and with cause #58 "bearer
       capability not presently available";

   -   enter the "active" state.

5.3.6         Support of multimedia calls

5.3.6.1           Service description
The 3GPP circuit-switched multimedia call is based on the 3G-324M (see 3GPP TS 26.111 [80]), which is a 3GPP-
variant of the ITU-T Recommendation H.324 [146]. CS Multimedia telephony is a Bearer Service, which utilizes the
Synchronous Transparent Data service (BS30), see 3GPP TS 22.002 [3].

At the multimedia call setup the required call type, 3G-324M, is indicated, for the network to be able to invoke
appropriate interworking functionality. In the peer end the H.324 information is used to invoke the terminal application.
In addition to H.324 indication the terminal must select Information Transfer Capability (ITC) for the multimedia call.
The 'correct' ITC depends on the peer end and the transporting networks; an all-ISDN call is a UDI/RDI call, and a call,
which involves PSTN, is an analog "3.1 kHz audio" call.

For the case when the setup of a multimedia call is not successful, fallback to speech is specified.

Users may also request a service change between UDI/RDI multimedia and speech modes during a call (see 3GPP TS
23.172 [97]).

5.3.6.2           Call establishment
For both mobile originating and mobile terminating calls, the normal call establishment procedures apply, with the
exceptions specified in the following subclauses.

For further description of the function of MSC/IWF in the following clauses, see 3GPP TS 29.007 [38].

5.3.6.2.1             Mobile originated multimedia call establishment
At call setup the required call type, 3G-324M, is indicated by the originating MS in the SETUP message, with the
bearer capability IE parameter Other Rate Adaption set to "H.223 and H.245".




                                                           ETSI
3GPP TS 24.008 version 15.8.0 Release 15                    302                        ETSI TS 124 008 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


For analogue multimedia, the support of a fallback to speech is requested by including two bearer capability IEs,
multimedia first and speech as the second BC in the SETUP message. The MS shall indicate fallback to speech by these
two BC IEs and the associated Repeat Indicator set to "support of fallback".

For UDI/RDI multimedia, the support of a fallback and service change is requested by including two bearer capability
IEs, with the first BC as the preferred service in the SETUP message. The MS shall indicate service change and fallback
by these two BC IEs and the associated Repeat Indicator set to "support of service change and fallback".

If the bearer capability IE is received from the MS either in A/Gb or GERAN Iu mode and indicates no A/Gb mode
support for the requested bearer service, the network shall consider it as a request to perform an inter-system handover
to UTRAN Iu mode, as described in 3GPP TS 23.009 [114] subclause 14.2.

The bearer compatibility checking in the network is according to subclause 5.3.4.2.1.

If the MS requested for an analogue multimedia call with fallback to speech, or for a UDI/RDI multimedia call with
fallback and service change, and the network accepts the call, the network has the following options for the inclusion of
bearer capability IEs in the CALL PROCEEDING message:

   -   if the network accepts the requested analogue multimedia call and supports fallback to speech, both multimedia
       and speech bearer capability IEs shall be included;

   -   if the network accepts the requested UDI/RDI multimedia call and supports fallback and service change, both
       multimedia and speech bearer capability IEs shall be included. The order of the bearer capability IEs determines
       the preferred service, and the network may reverse the order of these IEs (see 3GPP TS 23.172 [97],
       subclause 4.2.1);

   -   if the network accepts a multimedia (only) call, a multimedia bearer capability IE shall be included;

   -   if the network accepts a speech (only) call, a speech bearer capability IE shall be included;

   -   for a UDI/RDI multimedia call, if the network accepts the requested speech call and supports service change,
       both multimedia and speech bearer capability IEs shall be included. The order of the bearer capability IEs
       determines the preferred service, and the network may reverse the order of these IEs (see 3GPP TS 23.172 [97],
       subclause 4.2.1);

   -   if the network received a UDI/RDI multimedia bearer capability IE with FNUR equal to 32kbit/s and a speech
       bearer capability IE in the SETUP message, the network shall not release the call, but shall reply with one
       bearer capability IE only, as specified in 3GPP TS 23.172 [97].

   NOTE:      Service change and fallback for UDI/RDI multimedia calls is not supported with Fixed Network User
              Rate set to 32 kbit/s (see 3GPP TS 23.172 [97]).

If the MS requested for a multimedia call only, and the network accepts the call, the network shall always include a
single multimedia bearer capability IE in the CALL PROCEEDING message.

The originating user shall determine (possibly by pre-configuration of the terminal) whether a digital connection is
required or if the call will be an analog modem call. If the call is expected to be digital the multimedia bearer capability
IE parameter ITC is set to UDI/RDI. In an analog call the multimedia bearer capability IE parameter ITC is set to
"3,1 kHz audio ex PLMN". Additionally required modem type is indicated (Other Modem Type = V.34).

5.3.6.2.1.1              Fallback

If the network, during the setup of an H.324-call, detects that the transit network or the called end does not support an
H.324 call (e.g. because of a failure in the modem handshaking in case of an analogue multimedia call), then the
network initiates the in-call modification procedure (see subclause 5.3.4.3) towards the MS to modify the call mode to
speech, if the MS had included a speech bearer capability IE in the SETUP message.

In case of a UDI/RDI multimedia call with service change and fallback, if the network detects that the called end does
not support speech, then it initiates an in-call modification procedure towards the MS to modify the call mode to
multimedia, if the first bearer capability IE was for a speech call.

3GPP TS 24.008 version 15.8.0 Release 15                   303                        ETSI TS 124 008 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


5.3.6.2.2            Mobile terminating multimedia call
At call setup the required call type, 3G-324M, is indicated by the network in the SETUP message, with the bearer
capability IE parameter. Other Rate Adaption set to 'H.223 and H.245'. ITC is either '3,1 kHz audio ex PLMN' or
'UDI/RDI'.

For analogue multimedia, if the network supports fallback to speech and the subscriber has subscription to speech, two
bearer capability IEs, multimedia first and speech as the second BC are included in the SETUP message. The network
shall indicate fallback to speech by these two BC IEs and the associated Repeat Indicator set to "support of fallback".

For UDI/RDI multimedia, if the network supports fallback and service change, and the subscriber has subscription to
speech, two bearer capability IEs, with the first BC as the preferred service are included in the SETUP message. The
network shall indicate service change and fallback by these two BC IEs and the associated Repeat Indicator set to
"service change and fallback".

If the bearer capability IE is received from the MS either in A/Gb or GERAN Iu mode and indicates no A/Gb mode
support for the requested bearer service, the network shall consider it as a request to perform an inter-system handover
to UTRAN Iu mode, as described in 3GPP TS 23.009 [114] subclause 14.2.

The bearer capability IE(s) may (in the case of the single numbering scheme) be missing from the SETUP message.

The bearer compatibility checking in the MS is according to subclause 5.3.4.2.2.

The MS shall indicate the supported call type(s) in the CALL CONFIRMED message, which is the acknowledgement
to SETUP. If the network offered an analogue multimedia call with fallback to speech, or a UDI/RDI multimedia call
with fallback and service change, the MS has the following options for the inclusion of bearer capability IEs in the
CALL CONFIRMED message:

   -   if the MS/user accepts the offered analogue multimedia call and supports fallback to speech, both multimedia
       and speech bearer capability IEs shall be included;

   -   if the MS/user accepts the offered UDI/RDI multimedia call, and supports fallback and service change, both
       multimedia and speech bearer capability IEs shall be included. The order of the BC IEs determines the preferred
       service, and the MS/user may reverse the order of these IEs;

   -   if the MS/user accepts the offered multimedia call, but does not support fallback or service change, only a
       multimedia bearer capability IE shall be included;

   -   if the MS/user wishes a speech (only) call a speech bearer capability IE is included;

   -   for a UDI/RDI multimedia call, if the MS/user accepts the offered speech call and supports service change, both
       speech and multimedia bearer capability IEs shall be included. The order of the BC IEs determines the preferred
       service, and the MS/user may reverse the order of these IEs.

If the network offered a multimedia call only, and the MS/user accepts the call, the MS shall always include a single
multimedia bearer capability IE in the CALL CONFIRMED message.

If the SETUP contained no bearer capability IE the network shall perform compatibility checking of the CALL
CONFIRMED message in the same way as the compatibility checking of the SETUP message in the mobile originating
call case, described in subclause 5.3.6.2.1.

5.3.6.2.2.1              Fallback to speech

If modem handshaking fails (in a modem call), the call mode will be modified to speech if a speech bearer capability IE
was included. The modem signalling is inband, so the call must have reached the active state, when these conclusions
about the presence of modems can be done. The call modifications are realized through the in-call modification
procedure, by which the network requests the MS to modify the call mode (see subclause 5.3.4.3).

   NOTE:      Fallback from digital (UDI) H.324-call to speech after call setup is not a valid case at the terminating
              side.

5.3.6.3          In-call modification in the "active" state
The in-call modification procedure as described in subclause 5.3.4.3 shall be used to:




                                                          ETSI
3GPP TS 24.008 version 15.8.0 Release 15                     304                        ETSI TS 124 008 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


   -   trigger a service change between speech and UDI/RDI multimedia modes, when service change has been agreed
       at call setup;

   -   trigger a network-initiated service upgrade from speech to UDI/RDI multimedia modes (see
       3GPP TS 23.172 [97]). The network shall initiate this procedure only if the mobile station indicated support of
       the enhanced network-initiated in-call modification procedure in the Call Control Capabilities IE at call
       establishment. In this case, the MODIFY message shall include the Network-initiated Service Upgrade indicator
       IE; or

   -   modify the multimedia bearer capability for an analogue multimedia call (restricted to the network initiated in-
       call modification only). In this case, the network shall send a MODIFY message including the new Bearer
       Capability to be changed to. The following bearer capability parameters can be modified with the procedure (see
       3GPP TS 29.007 [38]):

       -   Fixed Network User Rate (analogue multimedia calls only).

5.3.6.3.1             Void

5.3.6.3.2             Void

5.3.6.3.3             Void

5.3.6.3.3.1               Void

5.3.6.3.3.2               Void

5.3.6.4           Multimedia CAT during the alerting phase of a mobile originated call
A mobile station supporting multimedia CAT during the alerting phase of a mobile originated multimedia call
establishment shall indicate support of this capability to the network in the Call Control Capabilities information
element in the SETUP message.

The network may generate a multimedia CAT to such a mobile station before it has reached the "active" state of a call.
To do so, the network shall through connect the traffic channel towards the source of the multimedia CAT and send a
progress indicator IE indicating user attachment with progress description #9 "In-band multimedia CAT available" in
either an ALERTING message or a PROGRESS message that is sent to the mobile station during call establishment.

On reception of an ALERTING or a PROGRESS message the mobile station shall proceed as specified elsewhere in
clause 5; if the progress indicator IE indicated user attachment with progress description #9 "In-band multimedia CAT
available", the mobile station shall:

   -   attach the user connection for multimedia as soon as an appropriate channel in multimedia mode is available; and

   -   set up an H.324 call.

It is up to the network to ensure that no undesired end-to-end through connection with the called party takes place
during the establishment of a mobile terminated call.

The mobile station shall not abort the call if an error or H.324 call clearing occurs during the setup or the lifetime of the
H.324 call during the alerting phase; the call control entity of the calling mobile station shall remain in its current state.

Upon reception of a new request from the network to attach the user connection with progress description #9 "In-band
multimedia CAT available", the mobile station shall release any on-going H.324 call, and set up a new H.324 call.

   NOTE:      The network can request the mobile station to restart a new H.324 call during the alerting phase of the call
              e.g. during call forwarding scenarios to transmit to the calling party the multimedia CAT of the
              forwarded-to party.

The network may initiate the in-call modification procedure (see subclause 5.3.4.3) towards the MS in the "call
delivered" state to modify the call mode to speech, if service change has been agreed at call setup.




                                                            ETSI
3GPP TS 24.008 version 15.8.0 Release 15                    305                        ETSI TS 124 008 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


Upon receiving an indication that the call has been accepted, the call control entity of the network shall send a
CONNECT message to its peer entity at the calling mobile station; start timer T313 and enter the "connect indication"
state. This message indicates to the call control entity of the calling mobile station that a connection has been
established through the network.

On reception of a CONNECT message, the mobile station shall proceed as specified elsewhere in clause 5; the mobile
station shall release any on-going H.324 call and set up a new H.324 call towards the called party.

Mobile stations supporting multimedia CAT during the alerting phase of a mobile originated multimedia call
establishment should also support the Media Oriented Negotiation Acceleration procedures specified in ITU-
T Recommendation H.324 Amendment 1 [117] and ITU-T Recommendation H.324 Amendment 2 [118].

5.3.6.5           DTMF transmission during a multimedia call
A mobile station supporting multimedia CAT during the alerting phase of a mobile originated multimedia call
establishment should support transmission of DTMFs during a H.324 call using the H.245 UserInputIndication message
(see ITU-T H.245 [119]) if it has attached the user connection for multimedia and an appropriate channel is available.

   NOTE:      DTMF can be used to convey to the network the end user request to stop or copy an on-going multimedia
              CAT.

5.3.6.6           vSRVCC handover to a circuit-switched multimedia call
Upon vSRVCC handover to a traffic channel suitable for a data call, the MS shall use a single bearer capability IE for
multimedia with ITC set to "UDI" and FNUR set to 64 kbit/s for the call.

   NOTE:      After the MS has attached the user connection (see subclause 5.2.4.3), the MS initially uses predefined
              codecs for voice and video as specified in 3GPP TS 26.111 [80]. Additionally, the MS can perform in-
              band codec re-negotiation using H.245 signalling according to the procedures defined in
              3GPP TS 26.111 [80].


5.4           Call clearing
5.4.1         Terminology
The following terms are used in the present document in the description of clearing procedures:

   -   A traffic channel (see 3GPP TS 44.003 [16]) is "connected" when the channel is part of a circuit-switched
       connection established according to the present document.

   -   A traffic channel is "disconnected" when the channel is no longer part of a circuit-switched connection, but is not
       yet available for use in a new connection.


5.4.2         Exception conditions
Under normal conditions, the call control entity of the mobile station or of the network initiates call clearing by sending
a DISCONNECT message to its peer entity; then both entities follow the procedures defined in subclauses 5.4.3 and
5.4.4 respectively.

As an exception to the above rule, the call control entity of the mobile station or of the network, in response to a SETUP
or START CC or CC-ESTABLISHMENT CC-ESTABLISHMENT CONFIRMED or RECALL message, can reject a
call by stopping all running call control timers, responding with a RELEASE COMPLETE message, releasing the MM
connection, and returning to the "null" state, provided no other response has previously been sent.

As a further exception, the call control entity of the network may initiate call clearing by stopping all running call
control timers, sending a RELEASE message, starting timer T308, and entering the "release request" state.

   NOTE:      This way to initiate call clearing by sending a RELEASE message should not be used by the network:

              -   if in-band tones/announcements are provided and the network decides to use the procedure described
                  in subclause 5.4.4.1.1.1 or 5.4.4.2.1;



                                                           ETSI
3GPP TS 24.008 version 15.8.0 Release 15                      306                        ETSI TS 124 008 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


               -   if the network wants to have the opportunity to respond to information sent by the mobile station
                   during call clearing, e.g. when the network indicates that "CCBS activation is possible".

A call control entity shall accept an incoming RELEASE COMPLETE message used to initiate the call clearing even
though the cause information element is not included.

A control entity shall accept an incoming RELEASE message used to initiate the call clearing even though the cause
information element is not included.

Furthermore, a call control entity shall regard an incoming RELEASE COMPLETE message as consistent with any of
its states; a call control entity shall regard an incoming RELEASE message as consistent with any of its states except
the null state: a call control entity of the mobile station shall regard an incoming DISCONNECT message as consistent
with any of its call control states except the "null" state, the "release request" state, and the "disconnect indication" state;
a call control entity of the network shall regard an incoming DISCONNECT message as consistent with any of its call
control states except the "null" state and the "release request" state.

   NOTE:       This allows the introduction of shorter call clearing procedures in the future.


5.4.3          Clearing initiated by the mobile station

5.4.3.1            Initiation of call clearing
Apart from the exceptions identified in subclause 5.4.2, the call control entity of the mobile station shall initiate clearing
by: stopping all running call control timers, sending a DISCONNECT message; starting timer T305; and entering the
"disconnect request" state.

5.4.3.2            Receipt of a DISCONNECT message from the mobile station.
The call control entity in the network in any state except the "null" state and the "release request" state shall, upon
receipt of a DISCONNECT message:

   -   Stop all running call control timers;

   -   initiate procedures to clear the network connection and the call to the remote user;

   -   send a RELEASE message to its peer entity;

   -   start timer T308; and

   -   enter the "release request" state.

   NOTE:       The RELEASE message has only local significance and does not imply an acknowledgement of clearing
               from the remote user.

5.4.3.3            Receipt of a RELEASE message from the network
The call control entity of the mobile station in any state except the "null" state and the "release request" state, shall,
upon receipt of a RELEASE message: stop all running call control timers; send a RELEASE COMPLETE message;
release the MM connection; and return to the "null" state.

5.4.3.4            Receipt of a RELEASE COMPLETE message from the mobile station
A call control entity of the network in any call control state shall, upon receipt of a RELEASE COMPLETE message
from its peer entity in the mobile station: stop all running call control timers; release the MM connection; and return to
the "null" state.

5.4.3.5            Abnormal cases
The call control entity of the mobile station in the "disconnect request" state, shall upon expiry of timer T305: send a
RELEASE message to the network with the cause number originally contained in the DISCONNECT message and

RELEASE message, start timer T308, and stay in the "release request" state. At second expiry of timer T308, the call
control entity of the network shall: release the MM connection; and return to the "null" state.


5.4.4         Clearing initiated by the network
Apart from the exception conditions identified in subclause 5.4.2, the call control entity of the network shall initiate
clearing by: sending a DISCONNECT message; and entering the "disconnect indication" state. The DISCONNECT
message is a local invitation to clear the call.

   NOTE:      When the network initiates clearing by sending a RELEASE message, the procedures described in
              subclauses 5.4.3., 5.4.3.4 and 5.4.3.5 are followed.

A mobile station that does not support the "Prolonged Clearing Procedure" shall comply with the requirements of
subclause 5.4.4.1 and shall ignore subclause 5.4.4.2. A mobile station that supports the "Prolonged Clearing Procedure"
shall comply with the requirements of subclauses 5.4.4.2 and shall ignore subclause 5.4.4.1.

5.4.4.2.4.1               Release, CCBS not requested

For a network that does not support the "CCBS activation" option:

       The call control entity of the network in any state except the "null" state and the "release request" state, shall,
       upon receipt of a RELEASE message: stop all running call control timers; send a RELEASE COMPLETE
       message; release the MM connection; and return to the "null" state.

For a network that does support the "CCBS activation" option:

       The call control entity of the network in any state except the "null" state and the "release request" state, shall,
       upon receipt of a RELEASE message without a Facility IE including an Invoke=CCBSRequest: stop all running
       call control timers; send a RELEASE COMPLETE message; release the MM connection; and return to the "null"
       state.

5.4.4.2.4.2               Release, CCBS Requested

For a network that does not support the "CCBS activation" option:

       The call control entity of the network in any state except the "null" state and the "release request" state, shall,
       upon receipt of a RELEASE message: stop all running call control timers; send a RELEASE COMPLETE
       message; release the MM connection; and return to the "null" state.

For a network that does support the "CCBS activation" option:

       The call control entity of the network in any state except the "null" state and the "release request" state, shall,
       upon receipt of a RELEASE message containing a Facility IE including an Invoke=CCBSRequest: stop all
       running call control timers; then attempt to activate the recall; then send a RELEASE COMPLETE message
       indicating the success or failure of the recall activation attempt; release the MM connection; and return to the
       "null" state.

5.4.4.2.5             Completion of clearing
A call control entity of the mobile station in any call control state shall, upon receipt of a RELEASE COMPLETE
message from its peer entity in the network: stop all running call control timers; release the MM connection; and return
to the "null" state.

5.4.4.2.5.1               Abnormal cases

The call control entity of the mobile station in the "release request" state shall at first expiry of timer T308 retransmit
the RELEASE message and restart timer T308. At second expiry of timer T308, the call control entity of the mobile
station shall: release the MM connection; and return to the "null" state.

The retransmitted RELEASE message need not contain the Facility IE including an Invoke=CCBSRequest, even if the
original RELEASE message did contain this IE.5.4.5 Clear collision

Clear collision occurs when both the mobile station and the network simultaneously transfer DISCONNECT messages
specifying the same call.

The behaviour of the network call control entity receiving a DISCONNECT message whilst in the "disconnect
indication" state is specified in subclause 5.4.3. The behaviour of the MS call control entity receiving a DISCONNECT
message whilst in the "disconnect request" state is defined in subclause 5.4.4.

Clear collision can also occur when both sides simultaneously transfer RELEASE messages related to the same call.
The entity receiving such a RELEASE message whilst within the "release request" state shall: stop timer T308; release
the MM connection; and enter the "null" state (without sending a RELEASE COMPLETE message).


5.4.5         Call clearing for SRVCC from CS to PS
If the MS receives the request from upper layers to release the call locally, the call control entity of the MS shall detach
the user connection, if connected, and enter the NULL state.


5.5           Miscellaneous procedures
5.5.1         In-band tones and announcements
When the network wants to make the mobile station attach the user connection (e.g. in order to provide in-band
tones/announcement) before the mobile station has reached the "active" state of a call, the network may include a
progress indicator IE indicating user attachment in a suitable CC message:

   -   Either it includes the IE in a SETUP, CALL PROCEEDING, ALERTING, or CONNECT message that is send
       during call establishment

   -   it sends a PROGRESS message containing the IE.

A progress indicator IE indicates user attachment if it specifies a progress description in the set {1, 2, 3} or in the set
{6, 7, 8, ..., 20}.

On reception of a SETUP, CALL PROCEEDING, ALERTING, CONNECT, or PROGRESS message the mobile
station shall proceed as specified elsewhere in clause 5; if the progress indicator IE indicated user attachment and a
speech mode traffic channel is appropriate for the call the mobile station shall in addition: attach the user connection for
speech as soon as an appropriate channel in speech mode is available. (If a new order to attach the user connection is
received before the attachment has been performed, the new order shall supersede the previous one.)

Under certain conditions the MS will have to attach the user connection before the CONNECT message. It is up to the
network to ensure that no undesired end-to-end through connection takes place during the establishment of a MT call.

   NOTE:      This allows the use of progress indicator IEs independently from the channel modes appropriate for the
              call.

The network may generate multimedia CAT to a mobile station supporting multimedia CAT during the alerting phase
of a mobile originated multimedia call establishment as specified in subclause 5.3.6.4.


5.5.2         Call collisions
Call collisions as such cannot occur at the network. Any simultaneous mobile originating or mobile terminating calls
are dealt with separately assigned and different transaction identifiers.


5.5.3         Status procedures

5.5.3.1           Status enquiry procedure
Whenever a call control entity wishes to check the call state of its peer entity, it may initiate the status enquiry
procedure.

   NOTE:      This may, in particular, apply to procedural error conditions described in clause 8.

A call control entity initiates the status enquiry procedure by sending the STATUS ENQUIRY message and starting
timer T322. The value of T322 is implementation dependent in the MS and set in the network by the network operator.
While timer T322 is running, the call control entity shall not send further STATUS ENQUIRY messages.




                                                            ETSI
3GPP TS 24.008 version 15.8.0 Release 15                    313                        ETSI TS 124 008 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


Upon receipt of a STATUS ENQUIRY message, the receiver shall respond with a STATUS message, reporting the
current call state and cause value #30 "response to STATUS ENQUIRY". Receipt of the STATUS ENQUIRY shall not
result in a state change relating to any protocol and connection of the receiver.

If a STATUS message is received that contains cause value #30 "response to status enquiry", timer T322 shall be
stopped and further appropriate actions taken, based on the information in that STATUS message, relative to the current
state of the receiver of the STATUS message. These further "appropriate actions" are implementation dependent.
However, the actions prescribed in subclause 5.5.3.2 shall apply.

If a clearing message is received while timer T322 is running, timer T322 shall be stopped, and call clearing shall
continue.

If timer T322 expires, the STATUS ENQUIRY message may be retransmitted maximally once. If T322 expires after
the STATUS ENQUIRY has been transmitted the maximum number of times, clearing of the call shall be initiated with
cause value #41, "temporary failure", in the first call clearing message.

5.5.3.2           Reception of a STATUS message by a CC entity

5.5.3.2.1            STATUS message with incompatible state
On receipt of a STATUS message reporting an incompatible call control state, the receiving entity shall clear the call by
sending a RELEASE COMPLETE message with cause # 101 "message not compatible with protocol state". The
reported call control state is incompatible if the combination of call control states at the sender and receiver side cannot
occur, do not match or cannot be aligned by actions of the receiver; the exact definition is implementation dependent.

5.5.3.2.2            STATUS message with compatible state
A STATUS message may be received indicating a compatible call state but containing one of the following causes:

   # 95 "semantically incorrect message"; or

   # 96 "invalid mandatory information"; or

   # 97 "message type non-existent or not implemented"; or

   # 98 "message type not compatible with protocol state"; or

   # 99 "information element non-existent or not implemented"; or

   # 100 "conditional IE error".

This indicates that the transmitter of the STATUS message was unable to accept some information sent by the recipient
of the STATUS message. This allow the recipient to retransmit some or all of the information. Other actions are
possible and are implementation dependent; they may include releasing the call.

In the case the MS receives a STATUS message with the cause #100 due to the presence of a Repeat Indicator with the
value "service change and fallback" in a SETUP message, it may then resend a new SETUP message with a single BC-
IE (no Repeat Indicator is included). The actual behaviour is dependent on the implementation.

In the case the network receives a STATUS message with the cause #100 due to the presence of a Repeat Indicator with
the value “service change and fallback” in a SETUP message, it shall then resend a new SETUP message, with either
the BC-IE of the preferred service or the speech BC-IE (fallback to speech) as the only BC (no Repeat Indicator is
included). The preferred behaviour is decided by configuration.


5.5.4         Call re-establishment, mobile station side
This subclause describes the internal handling in the mobile station as far as call control is concerned.

5.5.4.1           Indication from the mobility management sublayer
When a MM connection is active, an indication may be given by the MM sublayer to the call control entity to announce
that the current MM connection has been interrupted but might be re-established on request of call control.

5.5.4.2           Reaction of call control
Depending whether call re-establishment is allowed or not and on its actual state, call control shall decide to either
request re-establishment or to release the MM connection.

   a) Re-establishment not required

          If the call is in the call establishment or call clearing phase, i.e. any state other than the "active" state or the
          "mobile originating modify" state, call control shall release the MM connection

   b) Re-establishment required

          If the call is in the "active" state or "mobile originating modify" state, the indication from MM that re-
          establishment is possible shall cause call control to request re-establishment from the MM connection,
          suspend any further message to be sent and await the completion of the re-establishment procedure.

5.5.4.3           Completion of re-establishment
Call Control is notified when the MM connection is re-established and shall then resume the transmission of possibly
suspended messages and resume user data exchange when an appropriate channel is available.

5.5.4.4           Unsuccessful outcome
If the attempt to re-establish the connection was unsuccessful, the MM connection will be released and a release
indication will be given to call control, see subclause 4.5.1.6.


5.5.5         Call re-establishment, network side
This subclause describes the handling in the network as far as call control is concerned.

5.5.5.1           State alignment
After a successful call re-establishment it is a network responsibility to identify (e.g. by using the status enquiry
procedure, if needed, and resolve, if possible, any call state or auxiliary state mismatch between the network and the
mobile station.


5.5.6         Progress
At any time during the establishment or release of a call and during an active call the network may send a PROGRESS
message to the mobile station.

On receipt of a PROGRESS message during the establishment or release of a call the mobile station shall stop all call
control timers related to that call.

   NOTE:      If the PROGRESS has been received before the receipt of a CALL PROCEEDING message, the mobile
              station will not start timer T310 on receipt of a CALL PROCEEDING message, see subclause 5.2.1.1.3.

5.5.7         DTMF protocol control procedure
Dual Tone Multi Frequency (DTMF) is an inband one out of four plus one out of four signalling system primarily used
from terminal instruments in telecommunication networks. The support of DTMF in the network is described in
3GPP TS 23.014 [12].

3GPP TS 24.008 version 15.8.0 Release 15                  315                       ETSI TS 124 008 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


The mobile station shall be capable of transmitting DTMF messages as specified in this subclause if and only if the
mobile station has the user connection for speech attached and an appropriate channel is available.

The transaction identifier used by the DTMF messages shall be that of the attached speech call.

   NOTE 1: The present document means that DTMF messages can generally be sent in the active state of a call in
           speech transmission mode or when a traffic channel is available during setup or release and the progress
           indicator IE has been received.

   NOTE 2: Since the DTMF protocol messages are sent in a store and forward mode on the signalling channels the
           control of the device at the far end may be delayed dependent on the load or quality of the channels.

   NOTE 3: The procedures described in this paragraph support DTMF only in the direction mobile station to
           network.

A mobile station supporting multimedia CAT during the alerting phase of a mobile originated multimedia call
establishment should also be capable of transmitting DTMFs during a multimedia call as specified in subclause 5.3.6.5.

5.5.7.1          Start DTMF request by the mobile station
A user may cause a DTMF tone to be generated e.g. by depression of a key in the mobile station. The relevant action is
interpreted by the mobile station as a requirement for a DTMF digit to be sent in a START DTMF message on an
established FACCH. This message contains the value of the digit to be transmitted (0, 1, ..., 9, A, B, C, D, *, #).

Only a single digit will be transferred in each START DTMF message.

On sending a START DTMF message the MS shall start timer T336.

Where a previous START DTMF message has been sent, another START DTMF message shall only be sent by the MS
following receipt of its STOP DTMF ACKNOWLEDGE message (see subclause 5.5.7.4) or a START DTMF REJECT
message from the network (see subclause 5.5.7.2) or following the expiry of timers T336 and T337.

If timer T336 expires, the MS shall terminate the ongoing DTMF procedure without any retransmissions, and is free to
begin another DTMF procedure (e.g. another START DTMF message).

5.5.7.2          Start DTMF response by the network
Upon receiving the START DTMF message the network shall either:

   -   convert the received digit into a DTMF tone which is applied toward the remote user, or

   -   send the DTMF digit as an out-of-band message (see 3GPP TS 23.205 [96])

and return a START DTMF ACKNOWLEDGE message to the mobile station. This acknowledgement may be used in
the mobile station to generate an indication as a feedback for a successful transmission.

If the network cannot accept the START DTMF message a START DTMF REJECT message will be sent to the mobile
station. Upon receipt of a START DTMF ACK message or a START DTMF REJECT message, the MS shall stop timer
T336.

5.5.7.3          Stop DTMF request by the mobile station
When the user indicates that the DTMF sending should cease e.g. by releasing the key the mobile station will send a
STOP DTMF message to the network.

On sending a STOP DTMF message the MS shall start timer T337.

The MS shall only send a STOP DTMF message if a START DTMF ACKNOWLEDGE message has been received
from the network (see subclause 5.5.7.2).

If timer T337 expires, the MS shall terminate the ongoing DTMF procedure without any retransmissions, and is free to
begin another DTMF procedure. (e.g. another START DTMF message).

5.5.7.4           Stop DTMF response by the network
Upon receiving the STOP DTMF message the network shall either:

    -   stop sending the DTMF tone if applied by the network, or

    -   initiate a suitable out-of-band message (see 3GPP TS 23.205 [96])

and return a STOP DTMF ACKNOWLEDGE message to the mobile station. Upon receipt of a STOP DTMF
ACKNOWLEDGE message, the MS shall stop timer T337.

5.5.7.5           Sequencing of subsequent start DTMF requests by the mobile station
If the network is generating DTMF tones it shall ensure that the minimum length of tone and the minimum gap between
two subsequent tones (according to ETSI ES 201 235-2 [12a]) is achieved.

    NOTE 1: In ETSI ES 201 235-2 [12a] the minimum duration of a DTMF tone is 65ms.

    NOTE 2: In ETSI ES 201 235-2 [12a] the minimum gap between DTMF tones is 65ms.

There is no defined maximum length to the tone, which will normally cease when a STOP DTMF message is received
from the MS. However, the operator may choose to put a pre-defined time limit on the duration of tones sent.

The appropriate sequencing of DTMF control messages is shown in figures 5.8 and 5.9.

    NOTE 3: The network may implement the time limit option where the DTMF tone duration is controlled by the
            network irrespective of the receipt of a STOP DTMF message from the mobile station.

This chapter contains the description of the procedures for the session management of GPRS point-to-point data
services and MBMS point-to-point and point-to-multipoint data services at the radio interface (Reference point Uu and
Um).

6.1           GPRS Session management
6.1.1         General
The main function of the session management (SM) is to support PDP context handling of the user terminal.
Furthermore, the SM supports the MBMS context handling within the MS and the network, which allows the MS to
receive data from a specific MBMS source.

The SM comprises procedures for

   -   identified PDP context activation, deactivation and modification; and

   -   identified MBMS context activation and deactivation.

SM procedures for identified access can only be performed if a GMM context has been established between the MS and
the network. If no GMM context has been established, the MM sublayer has to initiate the establishment of a GMM
context by use of the GMM procedures as described in chapter 4. After GMM context establishment, SM uses services
offered by GMM (see 3GPP TS 24.007 [20]). Ongoing SM procedures are suspended during GMM procedure
execution.

The SM procedures for identified MBMS context activation and deactivation can only be performed, if in addition to
the GMM context the MS has a PDP context activated.

In Iu mode only, integrity protected signalling (see subclause 4.1.1.1.1 of the present document and in general, see
3GPP TS 33.102 [5a]) is mandatory. In Iu mode only, all protocols shall use integrity protected signalling. Integrity
protection of all SM signalling messages is the responsibility of lower layers. It is the network which activates integrity
protection. This is done using the security mode control procedure (3GPP TS 25.331 [23c] and 3GPP TS 44.118 [111]).

For the session management protocol, the extended TI mechanism may be used (see 3GPP TS 24.007 [20]).


6.1.2         Session management states
In this subclause, the SM states are described for one SM entity (see 3GPP TS 24.007 [20]). Each SM entity is
associated with one PDP context or MBMS context. Subclause 6.1.2.1 describes the SM states in the MS and
subclause 6.1.2.2 describes the SM states on the network side.

6.1.2.1           Session management states in the MS
In this subclause, the possible states of an SM entity in the mobile station are described. As illustrated in figure
6.1/3GPP TS 24.008 and 6.1a/3GPP TS 24.008 there are seven SM states in the MS.

6.1.2.1.1             PDP-INACTIVE
This state indicates that neither PDP context nor MBMS context exist.

6.1.2.1.2             PDP-ACTIVE-PENDING
This state exists when PDP context activation was requested by the MS.

6.1.2.1.3             PDP-INACTIVE-PENDING
This state exists when deactivation of the PDP contexts was requested by the MS.

6.1.2.1.4             PDP-ACTIVE
This state indicates that the PDP context is active.

6.1.2.1.5             PDP-MODIFY_PENDING
This state exists when modification of the PDP context was requested by the MS.

6.1.2A            PDP address allocation

6.1.2A.1               General
PDP addresses are handled differently for PDN interworking of type PPP and IP (IPv4 or IPv6).

6.1.2A.1.1                  Interworking with PDN based on IP
During PDP context activation (see subclause 6.1.3.1), the MS can configure an IPv4 address, or obtain an IPv6
interface identifier to be used during the IETF-based IP address allocation after PDP context establishment.

The MS can obtain an IPv4 address or an IPv6 prefix via an IETF-based IP address allocation mechanism once the PDP
context is established.

The following IETF-based IP address/prefix allocation methods are specified for GPRS (the corresponding procedures
are specified in 3GPP TS 29.061 [130]):

   a) /64 IPv6 default prefix allocation via IPv6 stateless address autoconfiguration. Optionally, allocation of
      additional IPv6 prefix(es) with length /64 or shorter via stateful DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation (see
      IETF RFC 3633 [139]);

   b) IPv4 address allocation and IPv4 parameter configuration via DHCPv4;

Upon deactivation of a default PDP context, the MS shall locally release any IPv4 address or IPv6 prefix allocated to
the MS for the corresponding PDN connection.

6.1.2A.1.2                  Interworking with PDN based on PPP
During PDP context activation no PDP address is configured. Instead, such information is negotiated and configured
during the NCP phase of PPP.



                                                                               ETSI
3GPP TS 24.008 version 15.8.0 Release 15                   322                       ETSI TS 124 008 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


6.1.2A.2         IP address allocation via NAS signalling
The MS shall set the PDP type in the PDP address IE in the ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message when
requesting establishment of a default PDP context; the detailed rules with regards to IP version for MS and network side
are defined in subclause 6.1.3.1.

If the MS wants to use DHCPv4 for IPv4 address assignment, it shall indicate that to the network within the Protocol
Configuration Options IE in the ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST.

If the MS requests allocation of an IPv6 address, the network constructs it of two parts: a /64 IPv6 prefix and an
interface identifier of 64 bits length. The IPv6 prefix part is not used immediately by the MS; however, the network
shall use the same IPv6 prefix in subsequent procedures for IETF-based IP address allocation. The interface identifier is
only used for building a unique link-local IPv6 address.


6.1.3         Session Management procedures

6.1.3.0          General
The MS's maximum number of active PDP contexts in a PLMN is determined by the lowest of the maximum number
of Network Service Access Point Identifiers (NSAPIs) allowed by the protocol (as specified in subclause 10.5.6.2), the
PLMN's maximum number of PDP contexts in Iu or A/Gb mode and the MS's implementation-specific maximum
number of PDP contexts.

   NOTE:      Subclauses 6.1.3.1.3 and 6.1.3.2.2 specify how the MS determines the PLMN's maximum number of PDP
              contexts in Iu or A/Gb mode.

6.1.3.1          PDP context activation
The purpose of this procedure is to establish a PDP context between the MS and the network for a specific QoS on a
specific NSAPI. The PDP context activation may be initiated by the MS or the initiation may be requested by the
network.

An MS attached for emergency bearer services shall only request a PDP context with request type set to "emergency". If
there already is a PDN connection for emergency bearer services established, the MS shall not request an additional
PDN connection for emergency bearer services. The MS shall not request emergency bearer services in A/Gb mode or
in GERAN Iu mode.

If the MS has reached the maximum number of active PDP contexts (see subclause 6.1.3.0) and the upper layers of the
MS request activation of additional PDP context, then the MS shall not send an ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT
REQUEST message or an ACTIVATE SECONDARY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message to activate the additional
PDP context. If the additional PDP context is a PDP context with type set to "emergency", then it may skip explicit
deactivation to free PDP context resources and instead re-activate the necessary context(s) relying on network handling
of abnormal cases as specified in subclause 6.1.3.1.5 case c). In either case it is an MS implementation option which
PDP context(s) to re-use for emergency.

Each PDP address may be described by one or more PDP contexts in the MS or the network. The PDP Context
Activation procedure is used to activate the default PDP context for a given PDP address and APN, i.e. a PDN
connection, whereas all additional contexts associated to the same PDP address and APN are activated with the
secondary PDP context activation procedure. An MS supporting S1 mode shall keep the default PDP context activated
during the lifetime of the PDN connection. An MS not supporting S1 mode should apply the same behaviour (see
3GPP TS 23.060 [74]). When more than one PDP context is associated to a PDP address, there shall be a Traffic Flow
Template (TFT), including one or more packet filters, for each or all but one context. The downlink and uplink packet
filters are considered separately. If present, the TFT shall be sent transparently either from the MS via the SGSN to the
GGSN to enable packet classification and policing for downlink data transfer in the GGSN or from the GGSN via the
SGSN to the MS to be used in a network requested secondary PDP context activation procedure (see subclause 6.1.3.2)
and enable packet classification and policing for uplink data transfer in the MS (see 3GPP TS 23.060 [74]).

For the purpose of requesting non-IP connectivity, the MS shall set the PDP type number in the Requested PDP address
information element in the ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message to "non IP". The MS supporting non-IP
connectivity shall also support the extended protocol configuration options IE.

For the purpose of requesting IP address allocation the MS shall set the PDP type number in the Requested PDP address
information element in the ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message based on its IP stack configuration (e.g.
the per APN settings specified in 3GPP TS 23.060 [74]) as follows:

   a) An MS, which is IPv6 and IPv4 capable, and

       -   has not been allocated an IP address for this APN, shall set the PDP type number to "IPv4v6 address";

       -   has been allocated an IPv4 address for this APN and received the SM cause #52, "single address bearers only
           allowed", and is requesting an IPv6 address, shall set the PDP type number to "IPv6 address";

       -   has been allocated an IPv6 address for this APN and received the SM cause #52, "single address bearers only
           allowed", and is requesting an IPv4 address, shall set the PDP type number to "IPv4 address".

   b) An MS, which is only IPv4 capable, shall set the PDP type number to "IPv4 address".

   c) An MS, which is only IPv6 capable, shall set the PDP type number to "IPv6 address".

   d) When the IP version capability of the MS is unknown in the MS (as in the case when the MT and TE are
      separated and the capability of the TE is not known in the MT), the MS shall set the PDP type number to
      "IPv4v6 address".

On receipt of the ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message sent by the MS, the network when allocating an IP
address shall take into account the PDP type number, the operator policies of the home and visited network, and the
user's subscription data.

   -   If the MS requests PDP type IPv4v6, but the network configuration dictates the use of IPv4 addressing only or
       IPv6 addressing only for this APN, the network shall override the PDP type requested by the MS to a single
       address PDP type (IPv4 or IPv6). In the ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT ACCEPT message sent to the MS, the
       network sets the PDP type number to either "IPv4 address" or "IPv6 address" and the SM cause to #50 "PDP
       type IPv4 only allowed", or #51 "PDP type IPv6 only allowed", respectively (see subclause 6.1.3.1.1).

   -   If the MS requests PDP type IPv4v6, but the operator uses single addressing per PDP context due to
       interworking with nodes of earlier releases, the network shall override the PDP type requested by setting the
       PDP type in the ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT ACCEPT message sent to the MS to a single address PDP type. In
       the ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT ACCEPT message sent to the MS, the network sets the PDP type number to
       either "IPv4 address" or "IPv6 address" and the SM cause to #52, "single address bearers only allowed" (see
       subclause 6.1.3.1.1).

The MS, in a pre release 8 network not supporting IPv4/v6, could encounter other network reactions:

   -   If the MS requests PDP type IPv4v6, and the PDP type is changed to PDP type IPv4 and no SM cause is
       included, the MS should request another PDP context for PDP type IPv6 to the same APN.

   NOTE:      Some networks can respond with ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REJECT with SM cause #28 "unknown
              PDP address or PDP type". In that instance, the MS can attempt to establish dual-stack connectivity by
              performing two PDP context activation request procedures to activate an IPv4 PDP context and an IPv6
              PDP context, both to the same APN.

6.1.3.1.1            Successful PDP context activation initiated by the mobile station
In order to request a PDP context activation, the MS sends an ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message to the
network, enters the state PDP-ACTIVE-PENDING and starts timer T3380. The message contains the selected NSAPI,
PDP type number and requested QoS. The MS shall ensure that the selected NSAPI is not currently being used by
another Session Management entity in the MS. The MS may indicate the support of Network Requested Bearer Control
procedures, the support of local IP address in TFTs or the 3GPP PS data off UE status in the protocol configuration
options information element. The MS supporting S1 mode shall indicate subscribed, interactive or background traffic
class in the QoS requested. The MS not supporting S1 mode should indicate subscribed, interactive or background
traffic class in the QoS requested. If there is a subscribed QoS profile available for the MS, the network may ignore the
requested QoS and apply the subscribed QoS profile (see 3GPP TS 23.060 [74]).

The MS shall set the request type to "initial request" when the MS is establishing connectivity to an additional PDN for
the first time, i.e. when it is an initial attach to that PDN. The MS shall set the request type to "handover" when the
connectivity to a PDN is established upon handover from a non-3GPP access network and the MS was connected to that

PDN before the handover to the 3GPP access network. If the MS is establishing connectivity for emergency bearer
services it shall set the request type to "emergency" and not include an APN in the ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT
REQUEST message.

Upon receipt of the ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message with request type set to "emergency" the
network shall use the APN or the GGSN/PDN GW configured for emergency bearer services.

Upon receipt of an ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message with a PDP type number "IPv4v6 address" in the
Requested PDP address information element, the network shall on sending the ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT ACCEPT
message:

   -   include the SM cause information element with cause #50 "PDP type IPv4 only allowed", if the requested PDN
       connectivity is accepted with the restriction that only PDP type IPv4 is allowed; or

   -   include the SM cause information element with cause #51 "PDP type IPv6 only allowed", if the requested PDN
       connectivity is accepted with the restriction that only PDP type IPv6 is allowed; or

   -   include the SM cause information element with cause #52 "single address bearers only allowed", if the requested
       PDN connectivity is accepted with the restriction that only single IP version bearers are allowed.

If the MS receives the SM cause value #50 "PDP type IPv4 only allowed" or #51 "PDP type IPv6 only allowed" in the
ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT ACCEPT message, the MS shall not subsequently request another PDP context to get a
PDP Type different from the one allowed by the network, until:

   -   all PDP contexts to the given APN are deactivated either explicitly between the MS and the network, i.e. PDP
       context deactivation procedure, or implicitly (without peer to peer signalling between the MS and the network)
       as a result of:

       i) PDP context synchronization during routing area updating or service request procedure;

       ii) PDP context deactivation initiated by the network,

       iii) detach from GPRS services; or;

       iv) a service request procedure is rejected with a cause which results in the MS entering state GMM-
           DEREGISTERED; or

   -   the PDP type which is used to access to the APN is changed.

   NOTE 1: Request to send another ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message with a specific PDP type
           comes from upper layers.

If the MS receives the SM cause value #52 "single address bearers only allowed" in the ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT
ACCEPT message, the MS should subsequently request another PDP context for the other PDP type to the same APN
with a single address PDP type (IPv4 or IPv6) other than the one already activated.

   NOTE 2: If the MT and TE are separated, the MS might not be able to use SM cause #52 "single address bearers
           only allowed" as a trigger for activating a second single-IP-stack PDP context.

Upon receipt of an ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message, the network selects a radio priority level based
on the QoS negotiated and may reply with an ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT ACCEPT message.

If the ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message included a low priority indicator set to "MS is configured for
NAS signalling low priority", the network shall store the NAS signalling low priority indication within the default PDP
context.

If the network receives an ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message with the same combination of APN and
PDP type as an already existing PDN connection, and multiple PDN connections for a given APN are allowed, the
network may retain the existing PDP contexts and proceed with the requested PDP context activation procedure.

Upon receipt of the message ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT ACCEPT the MS shall stop timer T3380, shall enter the
state PDP-ACTIVE. If the protocol configuration options information element is present, the network may indicate the
Bearer Control Mode that shall be used, the network support of local IP address in TFTs, or the 3GPP PS data off
support indication. If the protocol configuration options information element is not present or the Selected Bearer
Control Mode parameter is not present in the protocol configuration options information element, the MS shall apply
Bearer Control Mode 'MS only' for all active PDP contexts sharing the same PDP Address and APN. If the 3GPP PS

data off UE status is "activated", the MS behaves as described in subclause 4.7.1.10. If the offered QoS parameters
received from the network differ from the QoS requested by the MS, the MS shall either accept the negotiated QoS or
initiate the PDP context deactivation procedure. If the Request type information element is not present, the network
shall assume that the request type is "initial request".

   NOTE 3: If the MS requested a value for a QoS parameter that is not within the range specified by
           3GPP TS 23.107 [81], the network should negotiate the parameter to a value that lies within the specified
           range.

If the lower layers provide a L-GW Transport Layer Address value together with the ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT
REQUEST message and a PDN connection is established as a LIPA PDN connection due to the ACTIVATE PDP
CONTEXT REQUEST message, then the SGSN shall store the L-GW Transport Layer Address value as the GGSN
address in the PDP context of the LIPA PDN connection. If connectivity with the requested APN is accepted and the
network considers this PDN connection a LIPA PDN connection, then subject to operator policy the SGSN shall
include in the ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT ACCEPT message the Connectivity type IE indicating "the PDN
connection is considered a LIPA PDN connection".

If the lower layers provide a SIPTO L-GW Transport Layer Address value identifying a L-GW together with the
ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message and a PDN connection is established as a SIPTO at the local
network PDN connection due to the ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message, then the SGSN shall store the
SIPTO L-GW Transport Layer Address value as the P-GW address in the PDP context of the SIPTO at the local
network PDN connection.

If the lower layers provide a LHN-ID value together with the ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message and a
PDN connection is established as a SIPTO at the local network PDN connection due to the ACTIVATE PDP
CONTEXT REQUEST message, then the SGSN shall store the LHN-ID value in the PDP context of the SIPTO at the
local network PDN connection.

   NOTE 4: The receipt of a LHN-ID value during the establishment of the PDN connection, during routing area
           updating procedure or during inter-SGSN handover can be used as an indication by the SGSN that the
           SIPTO at the local network PDN connection is established to a stand-alone GW (see
           3GPP TS 23.060 [74]).

In A/Gb mode, the MS shall initiate establishment of the logical link for the LLC SAPI indicated by the network with
the offered QoS and selected radio priority level if no logical link has been already established for that SAPI. If the
offered QoS parameters received from the network differ from the QoS requested by the MS, the MS shall either accept
the negotiated QoS or initiate the PDP context deactivation procedure. If the LLC SAPI indicated by the network can
not be supported by the MS, the MS shall initiate the PDP context deactivation procedure.

In Iu mode, both the network and the MS shall store the LLC SAPI and the radio priority in the PDP context. If a Iu
mode to A/Gb mode system change is performed, the new SGSN shall initiate establishment of the logical link using
the negotiated QoS profile, the negotiated LLC SAPI, and selected radio priority level stored in the PDP context as in a
A/Gb mode to A/Gb mode Routing Area Update.

An MS, which is capable of operating in A/Gb mode, shall use a valid LLC SAPI, while an MS which is not capable of
operating in A/Gb mode shall indicate the LLC SAPI value as "LLC SAPI not assigned" in order to avoid unnecessary
value range checking and any other possible confusion in the network. When the MS uses a valid LLC SAPI, the
network shall return a valid LLC SAPI. The network shall return the "LLC SAPI not assigned" value only when the MS
uses the "LLC SAPI not assigned" value.

   NOTE 5: The radio priority level and the LLC SAPI parameters, though not used in Iu mode, shall be included in
           the messages, in order to support handover between Iu mode and A/Gb mode networks.

If a WLAN offload indication information element is included in the ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT ACCEPT message,
the MS shall store the WLAN offload acceptability values for this PDN connection and use the UTRAN offload
acceptability value to determine whether this PDN connection is offloadable to WLAN or not.

At inter-system change from Iu mode to A/Gb mode, SM shall locally deactivate the active PDP context(s) if SM does
not have the following parameters:

   -   LLC SAPI; and

   -   radio priority.

Upon receipt of the ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT ACCEPT message with the Connectivity type IE indicating "the PDN
connection is considered a LIPA PDN connection", the MS provides an indication to the upper layers that the
connectivity is provided by a LIPA PDN connection.

6.1.3.1.2           Successful PDP context activation requested by the network
In order to request a PDP context activation, the network sends a REQUEST PDP CONTEXT ACTIVATION message
to the MS and starts timer T3385. The message contains an offered PDP address. If available, the APN shall be included
in the REQUEST PDP CONTEXT ACTIVATION message.

Upon receipt of a REQUEST PDP CONTEXT ACTIVATION message if an APN is indicated in the message and the
timer T3396 is running for the APN, the MS shall stop the timer T3396, and then either initiate the PDP context
activation procedure as described in the previous subclause or reject the activation request by sending a REQUEST PDP
CONTEXT ACTIVATION REJECT message as described in subclause 6.1.3.1.4. If the REQUEST PDP CONTEXT
ACTIVATION message did not contain an APN, then the MS shall stop the timer T3396 associated with no APN. The
value of the reject cause IE of the REQUEST PDP CONTEXT ACTIVATION REJECT message shall indicate the
reason for rejection, e.g. "insufficient resources to activate another context".

The ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message sent by the MS in order to initiate the PDP context activation
procedure shall contain the PDP address, PDP Type and APN requested by the network in the REQUEST PDP
CONTEXT ACTIVATION message.

Upon receipt of the ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message, the network shall stop timer T3385.

The same procedures then apply as described for MS initiated PDP context activation.

6.1.3.1.3.1             General

Upon receipt of an ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message the network may reject the MS initiated PDP
context activation by sending an ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REJECT message to the MS. The message shall contain
a cause code that typically indicates one of the following causes:

   # 8:   Operator Determined Barring;

   # 26: insufficient resources;

   # 27: missing or unknown APN;

   # 28: unknown PDP address or PDP type;

   # 29: user authentication failed;

   # 30: activation rejected by GGSN, Serving GW or PDN GW;

   # 31: activation rejected, unspecified;

   # 32: service option not supported;

   # 33: requested service option not subscribed;

   # 34: service option temporarily out of order;

   # 35: NSAPI already used. The network shall not send this cause code (see note 1);

   # 50: PDP type IPv4 only allowed;

   # 51: PDP type IPv6 only allowed;

   # 57: PDP type IPv4v6 only allowed;

   # 58: PDP type non IP only allowed;

   # 65: maximum number of PDP contexts reached;

   # 66: requested APN not supported in current RAT and PLMN combination;

   # 95 - 111:   protocol errors;

   #112: APN restriction value incompatible with active PDP context; or

   #113: Multiple accesses to a PDN connection not allowed.

   NOTE 1: Pre-R99 network may send this cause code.

The network may include a Back-off timer value IE in the ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REJECT message. If the SM
cause value is #26 "insufficient resources" and if the request type in the ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST was
set to "emergency", the network shall not include a Back-off timer value IE.

If the Back-off timer value IE is included and the SM cause value is different from #26 "insufficient resources", #50
"PDP type IPv4 only allowed", #51 "PDP type IPv6 only allowed", #57 "PDP type IPv4v6 only allowed", #58 "PDP
type non IP only allowed" and #65 "maximum number of PDP contexts reached", the network may include the Re-
attempt indicator IE to indicate whether the MS is allowed to attempt a PDN connectivity procedure in the PLMN for
the same APN in S1 mode, and whether another attempt in A/Gb and Iu mode or in S1 mode is allowed in an equivalent
PLMN.

If the SM cause value is #50 "PDP type IPv4 only allowed", #51 "PDP type IPv6 only allowed", #57 "PDP type IPv4v6
only allowed" or #58 "PDP type non IP only allowed", the network may include the Re-attempt indicator IE without
Back-off timer value IE to indicate whether the MS is allowed to attempt a PDP context activation procedure in an
equivalent PLMN for the same APN in A/Gb or Iu mode using the same PDP type.

If the SM cause value is #66 "requested APN not supported in current RAT and PLMN combination", the network may
include the Re-attempt indicator IE without Back-off timer value IE to indicate whether the MS is allowed to attempt a
PDP context activation procedure in an equivalent PLMN for the same APN in A/Gb or Iu mode.

Upon receipt of an ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REJECT message, the MS shall stop timer T3380 and enter/remain in
state PDP-INACTIVE.

If the ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message was sent with request type set to "emergency" and the MS
receives an ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REJECT message, then the MS may inform the upper layers of the failure to
establish the emergency bearer.

   NOTE 2: This can result in the upper layers requesting establishment of a CS emergency call (if not already
           attempted in the CS domain) or initiating other implementation specific mechanisms, e.g. procedures
           specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [95] can result in the emergency call being attempted to another IP-CAN.

6.1.3.1.3.2             Handling of network rejection due to SM cause #26

If the SM cause value is #26 "insufficient resources" and the Back-off timer value IE is included, the MS shall ignore
the Re-attempt indicator IE provided by the network, if any, and take different actions depending on the timer value
received for timer T3396 in the Back-off timer value IE (if the MS is configured for dual priority, exceptions are
specified in subclause 6.1.3.12; if the MS is an MS configured to use AC11 – 15 in selected PLMN, exceptions are
specified in subclause 6.1.3.11):

   i) if the timer value indicates neither zero nor deactivated and an APN was included in the ACTIVATE PDP
      CONTEXT REQUEST message, the MS shall stop timer T3396 associated with the corresponding APN, if it is
      running. If the timer value indicates neither zero nor deactivated, the request type was different from
      "emergency", and no APN was included in the ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message, the MS shall
      stop timer T3396 associated with no APN if it is running. The MS shall then start timer T3396 with the value
      provided in the Back-off timer value IE and:

       -   shall not send another ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST, ACTIVATE SECONDARY PDP
           CONTEXT REQUEST or MODIFY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message with exception of those identified
           in subclause 6.1.3.3, for the same APN that was sent by the MS, until timer T3396 expires or timer T3396 is
           stopped; and

       -   shall not send another ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message without an APN and with request
           type different from "emergency", or another ACTIVATE SECONDARY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST or
           MODIFY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message with exception of those identified in subclause 6.1.3.3, for a

       -   shall not send another ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message without an APN and with request
           type different from "emergency", or another ACTIVATE SECONDARY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST or
           MODIFY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message with exception of those identified in subclause 6.1.3.3, for a
           non-emergency PDN connection established without an APN sent by the MS, if the APN was not included in
           the ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message and the request type was different from "emergency",
           until the MS is switched off or the SIM/USIM is removed or the MS receives for a non-emergency PDP
           context which was activated by the MS any of the following messages: a REQUEST PDP CONTEXT
           ACTIVATION without an APN, a REQUEST SECONDARY PDP CONTEXT ACTIVATION or MODIFY
           PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message for a non-emergency PDN connection established without an APN sent
           by the MS, or a DEACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message including SM cause #39 "reactivation
           requested" for a non-emergency PDN connection which was established without an APN sent by the MS.

       The timer T3396 remains deactivated upon a PLMN change or inter-system change; and

   iii) if the timer value indicates that this timer is zero, the MS:

       -   shall stop timer T3396 associated with the corresponding APN, if running, and may send an ACTIVATE
           PDP CONTEXT REQUEST, ACTIVATE SECONDARY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST or MODIFY PDP
           CONTEXT REQUEST message for the same APN; and

       -   if the APN was not included in the ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message and the request type
           was different from "emergency", the MS shall stop timer T3396 associated with no APN, if running, and may
           send an ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message without an APN, or another ACTIVATE
           SECONDARY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST or MODIFY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message for a non-
           emergency PDN connection established without an APN sent by the MS.

If the Back-off timer value IE is not included, then the MS may send another ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST,
ACTIVATE SECONDARY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST or MODIFY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message for the
same APN.

The MS may initiate a PDP context activation procedure for emergency bearer services even if the timer T3396 is
running.

If the timer T3396 is running when the MS enters state GMM-DEREGISTERED, the MS remains switched on, and the
SIM/USIM in the MS remains the same, then timer T3396 is kept running until it expires or it is stopped.

If the MS is switched off when the timer T3396 is running, and if the SIM/USIM in the MS remains the same when the
MS is switched on, the MS shall behave as follows:

   -   let t1 be the time remaining for T3396 timeout at switch off and let t be the time elapsed between switch off and
       switch on. If t1 is greater than t, then the timer shall be restarted with the value t1 – t. If t1 is equal to or less than
       t, then the timer need not be restarted. If the MS is not capable of determining t, then the MS shall restart the
       timer with the value t1; and

   -   if prior to switch off, timer T3396 was running because an ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST,
       ACTIVATE SECONDARY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST, MODIFY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST or

           the APN was not included in the ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message, until the back-off timer
           expires, the MS is switched off or the SIM/USIM is removed;

   ii) if the timer value indicates that this timer is deactivated, the MS:

       -   shall not send another ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message in the PLMN for the same APN
           that was sent by the MS, until the MS is switched off or the SIM/USIM is removed; and

       -   shall not send another ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message in the PLMN without an APN if
           the APN was not included in the ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message, until the MS is switched
           off or the SIM/USIM is removed; and

   iii) if the timer value indicates that this timer is zero, the MS:

       -   may send an ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message in the PLMN for the same APN; and

       -   may send an ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message in the PLMN without an APN if the APN
           was not included in the ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message.

If the Back-off timer value IE is not included, then the MS shall ignore the Re-attempt indicator IE provided by the
network, if any.

   i) Additionally, if the SM cause value is #8 "operator determined barring", #27 "missing or unknown APN", #32
      "service option not supported", or #33 "requested service option not subscribed", the MS shall proceed as
      follows:

       -   if the MS is registered in its HPLMN or in a PLMN that is within the EHPLMN list, the MS shall behave as
           described above in the present subclause, using the configured SM_RetryWaitTime value as specified in
           3GPP TS 24.368 [135] or in USIM file NASCONFIG as specified in 3GPP TS 31.102 [112], if available, as
           back-off timer value; and

       -   otherwise, if the MS is not registered in its HPLMN or in a PLMN that is within the EHPLMN list, or if the
           SM_RetryWaitTime value is not configured, the MS shall behave as described above in the present subclause
           using the default value of 12 minutes for the back-off timer.

   ii) For SM cause values different from #8 "operator determined barring", #27 "missing or unknown APN", #32
       "service option not supported", or #33 "requested service option not subscribed", the MS behaviour regarding the
       start of a back-off timer is unspecified.

The MS shall not stop any back-off timer upon a PLMN change or inter-system change. If the network indicates that a
back-off timer for the PDP context activation procedure and PLMN and APN combination is deactivated, then it
remains deactivated upon a PLMN change or inter-system change.

3GPP TS 24.008 version 15.8.0 Release 15                  330                        ETSI TS 124 008 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


   NOTE 1: This means the back-off timer can still be running or be deactivated for the given SM procedure and
           PLMN and APN combination when the MS returns to the PLMN or when it performs inter-system
           change back from S1 mode to A/Gb or Iu mode. Thus the MS can still be prevented from sending another
           ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message in the PLMN for the same APN.

If the back-off timer is started upon receipt of an ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REJECT message (i.e. the timer value
was provided by the network, a configured value is available or the default value is used as explained above) or the
back-off timer is deactivated, the MS behaves as follows:

   i) after a PLMN change the MS may send an ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message for the same APN
      in the new PLMN, if the back-off timer is not running and is not deactivated for the PDP context activation
      procedure and the combination of new PLMN and APN;

       Furthermore as an implementation option, for the SM cause values #8 "operator determined barring", #27
       "missing or unknown APN", #32 "service option not supported" or #33 "requested service option not
       subscribed", if the network does not include a Re-attempt indicator IE, the MS may decide not to automatically
       send another ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message for the same APN, if the MS registered to a new
       PLMN which is in the list of equivalent PLMNs.

   ii) if the network does not include the Re-attempt indicator IE to indicate whether re-attempt in S1 mode is allowed,
       or the MS ignores the Re-attempt indicator IE, e.g. because the Back-off timer value IE is not included, then:

      -   if the MS is registered in its HPLMN or in a PLMN that is within the EHPLMN list, the MS shall apply the
          configured SM_RetryAtRATChange value as specified in 3GPP TS 24.368 [135] or in USIM file NASCONFIG
          as specified in 3GPP TS 31.102 [112], if available, to determine whether the MS may attempt a PDN
          connectivity procedure for the same PLMN and APN combination in S1 mode; and

      -   if the MS is not registered in its HPLMN or in a PLMN that is within the EHPLMN list, or if the NAS
          configuration MO as specified in 3GPP TS 24.368 [135] is not available and the value for inter-system
          change is not configured in the USIM file NASCONFIG, then the MS behaviour regarding a PDN connectivity
          procedure for the same PLMN and APN combination in S1 mode is unspecified; and

   iii) if the network includes the Re-attempt indicator IE indicating that re-attempt in an equivalent PLMN is not
        allowed, then depending on the timer value received in the Back-off timer value IE, for each combination of a
        PLMN from the equivalent PLMN list and the APN the MS shall start a back-off timer for the PDP context
        activation procedure with the value provided by the network, or deactivate the respective back-off timer as
        follows:

      -   If the Re-attempt indicator IE additionally indicates that re-attempt in S1 mode is allowed, the MS shall start
          or deactivate the back-off timer for A/Gb and Iu mode only; and

      -   otherwise the MS shall start or deactivate the back-off timer for A/Gb, Iu, and S1 mode.

If the back-off timer for a PLMN and APN combination was started or deactivated in S1 mode upon receipt of a PDN
CONNECTIVITY REJECT message (see 3GPP TS 24.301 [120]) and the network indicated that re-attempt in A/Gb or
Iu mode is allowed, then this back-off timer does not prevent the MS from sending an ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT
REQUEST message in this PLMN for the same APN in A/Gb or Iu mode. If the network indicated that re-attempt in
A/Gb or Iu mode is not allowed, the MS shall not send any ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message in this
PLMN for the same APN in A/Gb or Iu mode until the back-off timer expires, the MS is switched off or the USIM is
removed.

   NOTE 2: The back-off timer is used to describe a logical model of the required MS behaviour. This model does not
           imply any specific implementation, e.g. as a timer or timestamp.

   NOTE 3: Reference to back-off timer in this section can either refer to use of timer T3396 or to use of a different
           packet system specific timer within the MS. Whether the MS uses T3396 as a back-off timer or it uses
           different packet system specific timers as back-off timers is left up to MS implementation. This back-off
           timer is stopped when the MS is switched off or the SIM/USIM is removed.

The MS may initiate a PDP context activation procedure for emergency bearer services even if the back-off timer is
running.

If the SM cause value is #50 "PDP type IPv4 only allowed", #51 "PDP type IPv6 only allowed", #57 "PDP type IPv4v6
only allowed" or #58 "PDP type non IP only allowed", the MS shall ignore the Back-off timer value IE provided by the

network, if any. The MS shall not automatically send another ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message for the
same APN that was sent by the MS using the same PDP type, until any of the following conditions is fulfilled:

   -   the MS is registered to a new PLMN, and either the network did not include a Re-attempt indicator IE in the
       ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REJECT message or the Re-attempt indicator IE included in the message
       indicated that re-attempt in an equivalent PLMN is allowed;

   -   the MS is registered to a new PLMN which was not in the list of equivalent PLMNs at the time when the
       ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REJECT message was received;

   -   the PDP type which is used to access to the APN is changed;

   -   the MS is switched off; or

   -   the SIM/USIM is removed.

For the SM cause values #50 "PDP type IPv4 only allowed", #51 "PDP type IPv6 only allowed", #57 "PDP type IPv4v6
only allowed" and #58 "PDP type non IP only allowed" the MS shall ignore the value of the RATC bit in the Re-
attempt indicator IE provided by the network, if any.

Furthermore as an implementation option, for the SM cause values #50 "PDP type IPv4 only allowed", #51 "PDP type
IPv6 only allowed", #57 "PDP type IPv4v6 only allowed" and #58 "PDP type non IP only allowed", if the network does
not include a Re-attempt indicator IE the MS may decide not to automatically send another ACTIVATE PDP
CONTEXT REQUEST message for the same APN that was sent by the MS using the same PDP type, if the MS
registered to a new PLMN which is in the list of equivalent PLMNs.

   NOTE 4: Request to send another ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message with a specific PDP type has
           to come from upper layers.

If the SM cause value is #65 "maximum number of PDP contexts reached", the MS shall determine the PLMN's
maximum number of PDP contexts in A/Gb or Iu mode (see subclause 6.1.3.0) as the number of active PDP contexts it
has. The MS shall ignore the Back-off timer value IE and Re-attempt indicator IE provided by the network, if any.

   NOTE 5: In some situations, when attempting to establish multiple PDP contexts, the number of active PDP
           contexts that the MS has when SM cause #65 is received is not equal to the maximum number of PDP
           contexts reached in the network.

   NOTE 6: When the network supports emergency bearer services, it is not expected that SM cause #65 is returned
           by the network when the MS requests a PDP context for emergency bearer services.

The PLMN's maximum number of PDP contexts in A/Gb or Iu mode applies to the PLMN in which the SM cause #65
"maximum number of PDP contexts reached" is received. When the MS is switched off or when the USIM is removed,
the MS shall clear all previous determinations representing any PLMN's maximum number of PDP contexts in A/Gb or
Iu mode (see subclause 6.1.3.0). Upon successful registration with a new PLMN, the MS may clear previous
determinations representing any PLMN's maximum number of PDP contexts in A/Gb or Iu mode.

If the SM cause value is #66 "requested APN not supported in current RAT and PLMN combination", the MS shall take
different actions depending on the Back-off timer value IE and the Re-attempt indicator IE optionally included:

   i) If the Back-off timer value IE is not included, and either the Re-attempt indicator IE is not included or the Re-
      attempt indicator IE is included indicating that re-attempt in an equivalent PLMN is allowed, the MS shall not
      send an ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message for the same APN in the current PLMN in A/Gb or
      Iu mode until the MS is switched off or the SIM/USIM is removed;

   ii) if the Back-off timer value IE is not included, and the Re-attempt indicator IE is included and indicates that re-
       attempt in an equivalent PLMN is not allowed, the MS shall not send an ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT
       REQUEST message for the same APN in any PLMN in the list of equivalent PLMNs in A/Gb or Iu mode until
       the MS is switched off or the SIM/USIM is removed; and

   iii) if the Back-off timer value IE is included, the MS shall take different actions depending on the timer value
        received in the Back-off timer value IE:

       a) if the timer value indicates neither zero nor deactivated, the MS shall start the back-off timer with the value
          provided in the Back-off timer value IE for the PLMN and APN combination and shall not send another

           ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST for the same APN in the current PLMN in A/Gb or Iu mode until
           the back-off timer expires, the MS is switched off or the SIM/USIM is removed;

       b) if the timer value indicates that this timer is deactivated, the MS shall not send another ACTIVATE PDP
          CONTEXT REQUEST message for the same APN in the current PLMN in A/Gb or Iu mode until the MS is
          switched off or the SIM/USIM is removed; and

       c) if the timer value indicates that this timer is zero, the MS may send an ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT
          REQUEST message in the PLMN for the same APN.

       If the network includes the Re-attempt indicator IE indicating that re-attempt in an equivalent PLMN is not
       allowed, then

       -   for case a) the MS shall additionally start a back-off timer with the value provided in the Back-off timer
           value IE for the PDP context activation procedure for each combination of a PLMN from the equivalent
           PLMN list and the APN; and

       -   for case b) the MS shall deactivate the respective back-off timers for the PDP context activation procedure
           for each combination of a PLMN from the equivalent PLMN list and the APN.

For the SM cause value #66 "requested APN not supported in current RAT and PLMN combination" the MS shall
ignore the value of the RATC bit in the Re-attempt indicator IE provided by the network, if any.

As an implementation option, for cases i), iii.a) and iii.b), if the Re-attempt indicator IE is not included, the MS may
decide not to automatically send another ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message for the same APN in a
PLMN which is in the list of equivalent PLMNs.

6.1.3.1.3A            Void

6.1.3.1.4             Unsuccessful PDP context activation requested by the network
Upon receipt of the REQUEST PDP CONTEXT ACTIVATION message, the MS may reject the network requested
PDP context activation by sending the REQUEST PDP CONTEXT ACTIVATION REJECT message to the network.
The message contains the same TI as included in the REQUEST PDP CONTEXT ACTIVATION and an additional
cause code that typically indicates one of the following causes:

       # 26: insufficient resources;

       # 31: activation rejected, unspecified;

       # 40: feature not supported; or

       # 95 - 111: protocol errors.

The network shall stop timer T3385 and enter state PDP-INACTIVE.

6.1.3.1.5             Abnormal cases
The following abnormal cases can be identified:

   a) Expiry of timers

       In the mobile station:

           On the first expiry of the timer T3380, the MS shall resend the ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST and
           shall reset and restart timer T3380. This retransmission is repeated four times, i.e. on the fifth expiry of timer
           T3380, the MS shall release all resources possibly allocated for this invocation and shall abort the procedure;
           no automatic PDP context activation re-attempt shall be performed; and

       -   if the ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message was sent with request type set to "emergency", then
           the MS may inform the upper layers of the failure to establish the emergency bearer.

   NOTE:      This can result in the upper layers requesting establishment of a CS emergency call (if not already
              attempted in the CS domain) or initiating other implementation specific mechanisms, e.g. procedures
              specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [95] can result in the emergency call being attempted to another IP-CAN.

      On the network side:

          On the first expiry of the timer T3385, the network shall resend the message REQUEST PDP CONTEXT
          ACTIVATION and shall reset and restart timer T3385. This retransmission is repeated four times, i.e. on the
          fifth expiry of timer T3385, the network shall release possibly allocated resources for this activation and shall
          abort the procedure.

   b) Collision of MS initiated and network requested PDP context activation

      If the MS uses dynamic PDP addressing that turns out to collide with the network requested PDP address, then
      there is no detection of collision specified but left for network implementation.

   c) MS initiated PDP context activation request for an already activated PDP context (on the network side)

          i) If the network receives a ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message with the same combination
             of APN, PDP type and PDP address as an already activated PDP context, the network shall deactivate the
             existing PDP context and, if any, all the linked PDP contexts (matching the combination of APN, PDP
             type and PDP address), locally without notification to the MS and proceed with the requested PDP
             context activation.

          ii) Alternatively (different combination of APN, PDP type and PDP address), if the NSAPI matches that of
              an already activated PDP context, then the network shall deactivate only the existing PDP context locally
              without notification to the MS and proceed with the requested PDP context activation.

      It is an implementation option if the parameters used for comparison described in clause i) and ii) are the
      parameters provided in the (current and previous) ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUESTs or the parameters
      which are the result of the application of the selection rules defined in 3GPP TS 23.060 [74] Annex A.2.

      The parameter provided in the current ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST can not be compared to the
      actually used parameters (result of application of selection rules defined in 3GPP TS 23.060 [74] Annex A.2) of
      the previously activated PDP contexts.

      If the network receives an ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message with request type "emergency" and
      there already is a PDN connection for emergency bearer services existing, the network shall reject the request
      with cause code #31 "activation rejected, unspecified".

   d) Network initiated PDP context activation request for an already activated PDP context (on the mobile station
      side)

          If the MS receives a REQUEST PDP CONTEXT ACTIVATION message with the same combination of
          APN, PDP type and PDP address as an already activated PDP context, the MS shall deactivate the existing
          PDP context and, if any, all the linked PDP contexts (matching the combination of APN, PDP type and PDP
          address) locally without notification to the network and proceed with the requested PDP context activation.

   e) Additional MS initiated PDP context activation request received from an MS that is attached for emergency
      bearer services:

      If the MS is attached for emergency bearer services the network shall only accept the PDP context activation
      request for emergency services. The network shall reject any other PDP context activation request with cause
      code #31 "activation rejected, unspecified".

   f) Reception of the ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT ACCEPT message and Bearer Control Mode violation

      If the Selected Bearer Control Mode indicates other value than 'MS only' in the ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT
      ACCEPT message although the protocol configuration options information element was not present or the MS
      Support of Network Requested Bearer Control indicator was not present in the protocol configuration options
      information element of the corresponding ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message, the MS shall
      ignore the Selected Bearer Control Mode parameter received from the network and apply Bearer Control Mode
      'MS only' for all active PDP contexts sharing the same PDP Address and APN.

6.1.3.1.6            Handling Activate PDP context request for MS configured for dual priority
If a PDP context exists that was created due to a request including a low priority indicator set to "MS is configured for
NAS signalling low priority" and the upper layers of the MS request to activate a PDP context with the same APN and
the low priority indicator set to "MS is not configured for NAS signalling low priority", when initiating the PDP context
activation procedure, the MS shall:

   -   send an ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message with the same combination of APN, PDP type and
       PDP address as the existing PDP context to activate a PDP context;

   NOTE 1: This option relies on the network handling of abnormal cases as specified in subclause 6.1.3.1.5 case c).

   -   send an ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message with the same combination of APN and PDP type as
       the existing PDP context but with a different PDP address, or without PDP address, to activate a PDP context; or

   -   send an ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message with the same APN after the successful deactivation

   NOTE 2: The above list of options also apply for the case when the existing PDP context was created due to a
           request including a low priority indicator set to "MS is not configured for NAS signalling low priority"
           and the new request to activate a PDP context with the same APN contains a low priority indicator set to
           "MS is configured for NAS signalling low priority".

As an alternative the upper layers of the MS can request to activate a PDP context with a different APN.

6.1.3.2           Secondary PDP Context Activation Procedure
The purpose of this procedure is to establish an additional PDP context between the MS and the network for a specific
Traffic Flow Template (TFT) and QoS profile on a specific NSAPI, when one or more PDP contexts has/have already
been established for the particular PDP address and APN. The MS shall include a request for a TFT comprising at least
one packet filter applicable for the uplink direction. Depending on the selected Bearer Control Mode being 'MS only' or
'MS/NW', the secondary PDP context activation procedure may either be initiated by the MS or by either the MS or the
network, respectively. However, the network and the MS shall not initiate a secondary PDP context activation
procedure for established PDP context of "non IP" PDP type.

The network shall allocate packet filter identifiers and manage packet filter evaluation precedence for the packet filters
added by the network. The the MS shall allocate packet filter identifiers and manage packet filter evaluation precedence
for the packet filters added by the MS.

If there is a PDN connection for emergency bearer services established, the MS shall not initiate a secondary PDP
context activation procedure for this connection unless triggered by the network.

   NOTE:      3GPP TS 23.060 [74] subclause 9.3 specifies that a packet filter applicable for the downlink direction is
              not mandatory in a TFT.

6.1.3.2.1            Successful Secondary PDP Context Activation Procedure Initiated by the MS
In order to request a PDP context activation with the same PDP address and APN as an already active PDP context, the
MS shall send an ACTIVATE SECONDARY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message to the network, enter the state
PDP-ACTIVE-PENDING and start timer T3380. The message shall contain the selected NSAPI. The MS shall ensure
that the selected NSAPI is not currently being used by another Session Management entity in the MS. The message
shall also include a QoS profile, a requested LLC SAPI and the Linked TI. The QoS profile is the requested QoS. If
present, the TFT shall be sent transparently through the SGSN to the GGSN to enable packet classification and policing
for downlink data transfer. If the selected Bearer Control Mode is 'MS/NW' and a TFT IE is included in the
ACTIVATE SECONDARY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message, the MS shall set the packet filter direction
parameter of each packet filter in the TFT to a value different from "00". The MS shall allocate packet filter identifiers
for all packet filters included in the TFT.

Upon receipt of an ACTIVATE SECONDARY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST, the network shall validate the message by
verifying the TI given in the Linked TI IE to be any of the active PDP context(s). The same GGSN address shall be
used by the SGSN as for the already established PDP context(s) for that PDP address. The network shall select a radio
priority level based on the QoS negotiated and shall reply with an ACTIVATE SECONDARY PDP CONTEXT
ACCEPT message, if the request can be accepted.

   NOTE 1: If the MS requested a value for a QoS parameter that is not within the range specified by 3GPP TS 23.107
           [81], the network should negotiate the parameter to a value that lies within the specified range.

Upon receipt of the message ACTIVATE SECONDARY PDP CONTEXT ACCEPT, the MS shall stop timer T3380
and enter the state PDP-ACTIVE. If the offered QoS parameters received from the network differ from the QoS
requested by the MS, the MS shall either accept the negotiated QoS or initiate the PDP context deactivation procedure.

In A/Gb mode the MS shall initiate establishment of the logical link for the LLC SAPI indicated by the network with
the offered QoS and selected radio priority level if no logical link has been already established for that SAPI. If the LLC
SAPI indicated by the network can not be supported by the MS, the MS shall initiate the PDP context deactivation
procedure.

In Iu mode, both SGSN and MS shall store the LLC SAPI and the radio priority in the PDP context. If an Iu mode to
A/Gb mode Routing Area Update is performed, the new SGSN shall initiate establishment of the logical link using the
negotiated LLC SAPI, the negotiated QoS profile and selected radio priority level stored in the PDP context as in an
A/Gb mode to A/Gb mode Routing Area Update.

An MS, which is capable of operating in A/Gb mode, shall use a valid LLC SAPI, while an MS which is not capable of
operating in A/Gb mode shall indicate the LLC SAPI value as "LLC SAPI not assigned" in order to avoid unnecessary
value range checking and any other possible confusion in the network. When the MS uses a valid LLC SAPI, the
network shall return a valid LLC SAPI. The network shall return the “LLC SAPI not assigned” value only when the MS
uses the “LLC SAPI not assigned” value.

   NOTE 2: The radio priority level and the LLC SAPI parameters, though not used in Iu mode, shall be included in
           the messages, in order to support handover between Iu mode and A/Gb mode networks.

At inter-system change from Iu mode to A/Gb mode, SM shall locally deactivate the active PDP context(s) if SM does
not have the following parameters:

   -   LLC SAPI; and

   -   radio priority.

6.1.3.2.1a               Successful Secondary PDP Context Activation Procedure Requested by the
                         network
In order to request a PDP context activation with the same PDP address and APN as an already active PDP context, the
network shall send a REQUEST SECONDARY PDP CONTEXT ACTIVATION message to the MS and start timer
T3385. The message contains the required QoS, Linked TI, and optionally protocol configuration options and a TFT.
The network shall always include a TFT in the REQUEST SECONDARY PDP CONTEXT ACTIVATION message. If
present, the TFT shall be sent transparently through the SGSN to the MS to enable packet classification and policing for
uplink and downlink data transfer. The network shall allocate packet filter identifiers for all packet filters included in
the TFT.

   NOTE:      A network implementing an earlier release of this specification can send a REQUEST SECONDARY
              PDP CONTEXT ACTIVATION message without any TFT.

Upon receipt of a REQUEST SECONDARY PDP CONTEXT ACTIVATION message, if the MS sent an APN for the
establishment of the PDN connection, the MS shall stop the timer T3396 if it is running for the APN sent by the MS. If
the MS did not send an APN for the establishment of the PDN connection and the request type was different from
"emergency", the MS shall stop the timer T3396 associated with no APN if it is running. If the REQUEST
SECONDARY PDP CONTEXT ACTIVATION message was received for an emergency PDN connection, the UE shall
not stop the timer T3396 associated with no APN if it is running. For any case, the MS shall then either initiate the
secondary PDP context activation procedure as described in the subclause 6.1.3.2.1 or shall reject the activation request
by sending a REQUEST SECONDARY PDP CONTEXT ACTIVATION REJECT message as described in
subclause 6.1.3.2.2a. The value of the reject cause IE of the REQUEST SECONDARY PDP CONTEXT
ACTIVATION REJECT message shall indicate the reason for rejection, e.g. "insufficient resources to activate another
context".

The MS shall maintain the previously negotiated Bearer Control Mode (BCM) for all active PDP contexts sharing the
same PDP Address and APN and ignore any BCM parameter, if included in the REQUEST SECONDARY PDP
CONTEXT ACTIVATION message. If the previously negotiated BCM is 'MS only', the MS should reject the PDP
context activation (see subclause 6.1.3.2.2a).

The ACTIVATE SECONDARY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message sent by the MS in order to initiate the secondary
PDP context activation procedure shall contain the QoS and Linked TI required in the REQUEST SECONDARY PDP
CONTEXT ACTIVATION message. The MS shall also include a TFT with packet filters as specified in the REQUEST
SECONDARY PDP CONTEXT ACTIVATION message.

Upon receipt of the ACTIVATE SECONDARY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message, the network shall stop timer
T3385.

The same procedures then apply as described for MS initiated secondary PDP context activation.

6.1.3.2.2            Unsuccessful Secondary PDP Context Activation Procedure initiated by the MS

6.1.3.2.2.1              General

Upon receipt of an ACTIVATE SECONDARY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message, the network may reject the MS
initiated PDP context activation by sending an ACTIVATE SECONDARY PDP CONTEXT REJECT message to the
MS. The message shall contain a cause code that typically indicates one of the following:

   # 26: insufficient resources;

   # 30: activation rejected by GGSN, Serving GW or PDN GW;

   # 31: activation rejected, unspecified;

   # 32: service option not supported;

   # 33: requested service option not subscribed;

   # 34: service option temporarily out of order;

   # 41: semantic error in the TFT operation;

   # 42: syntactical error in the TFT operation;

   # 43: unknown PDP context;

   # 44: semantic errors in packet filter(s);

   # 45: syntactical errors in packet filter(s);

   # 46: PDP context without TFT already activated;

   # 48: request rejected, Bearer Control Mode violation;

   # 56: collision with network initiated request;

   # 60: bearer handling not supported;

   # 65: maximum number of PDP contexts reached; or

   # 95 - 111:   protocol errors.

The network may include a Back-off timer value IE in the ACTIVATE SECONDARY PDP CONTEXT REJECT
message.

If the Back-off timer value IE is included and the SM cause value is different from #26 "insufficient resources" and #65
"maximum number of PDP contexts reached", the network may include the Re-attempt indicator IE to indicate whether
the MS is allowed to attempt a bearer resource allocation procedure in the PLMN for the same APN in S1 mode, and
whether another attempt in A/Gb and Iu mode or in S1 mode is allowed in an equivalent PLMN.

If the ACTIVATE SECONDARY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message is related to an already active LIPA PDN
connection or SIPTO at the local network PDN connection, then the network shall reply with an ACTIVATE
SECONDARY PDP CONTEXT REJECT message with cause code #60 "bearer handling not supported".

If a PDP context for the TI given in the Linked TI IE exists, then the TFT in the ACTIVATE SECONDARY PDP
CONTEXT REQUEST message is checked by the network for different types of TFT IE errors as specified in
subclause 6.1.3.2.3.

Upon receipt of an ACTIVATE SECONDARY PDP CONTEXT REJECT message, the MS shall stop timer T3380 and
enter the state PDP-INACTIVE.

6.1.3.2.2.2              Handling of network rejection due to SM cause #26

If the SM cause value is #26 "insufficient resources" and the Back-off timer value IE is included, the MS shall ignore
the Re-attempt indicator IE provided by the network, if any, and take different actions depending on the timer value
received for timer T3396 in the Back-off timer value IE (if the MS is configured for dual priority, exceptions are

specified in subclause 6.1.3.12; if the MS is an MS configured to use AC11 – 15 in selected PLMN, exceptions are
specified in subclause 6.1.3.11):

   i) if the timer value indicates neither zero nor deactivated, the MS shall stop timer T3396 associated with the
      corresponding APN, if it is running. The MS shall then start timer T3396 with the value provided in the Back-off
      timer value IE and not send another ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST, ACTIVATE SECONDARY PDP
      CONTEXT REQUEST or MODIFY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message with exception of those identified in
      subclause 6.1.3.3, for the same APN until timer T3396 expires or timer T3396 is stopped. If the MS did not send
      an APN for the establishment of the PDN connection and the request type was different from "emergency", the
      MS shall stop timer T3396 associated with no APN, if it is running. The MS shall then start timer T3396 with
      the value provided in the Back-off timer value IE and not send another ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST
      without an APN and with request type different from "emergency", or another ACTIVATE SECONDARY PDP
      CONTEXT REQUEST or MODIFY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message with exception of those identified in
      subclause 6.1.3.3, for a non-emergency PDN connection established without an APN sent by the MS, until timer
      T3396 expires or timer T3396 is stopped. The MS shall not stop timer T3396 upon a PLMN change or inter-
      system change;

   ii) if the timer value indicates that this timer is deactivated, the MS shall not send another ACTIVATE PDP
       CONTEXT REQUEST, ACTIVATE SECONDARY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST or MODIFY PDP CONTEXT
       REQUEST message with exception of those identified in subclause 6.1.3.3, for the same APN until the MS is
       switched off or the SIM/USIM is removed or the MS receives a REQUEST PDP CONTEXT ACTIVATION,
       REQUEST SECONDARY PDP CONTEXT ACTIVATION or MODIFY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message
       for the same APN or a DEACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message including SM cause #39
       "reactivation requested" for a PDP context which was activated by the MS for the same APN from the network.
       If the MS did not send an APN for the establishment of the PDN connection and the request type was different
       from "emergency", the MS shall not send another ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST without an APN and
       with request type different from "emergency", or another ACTIVATE SECONDARY PDP CONTEXT
       REQUEST or MODIFY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST with exception of those identified in subclause 6.1.3.3, for
       a non-emergency PDN connection established without an APN sent by the MS, until the MS is switched off or
       the SIM/USIM is removed or the MS receives any of the following messages: a REQUEST PDP CONTEXT
       ACTIVATION without an APN, a REQUEST SECONDARY PDP CONTEXT ACTIVATION or MODIFY
       PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message for a non-emergency PDN connection established without an APN sent by
       the MS, or a DEACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message including SM cause #39 "reactivation
       requested" for a PDP context which was activated by the MS for a non-emergency PDN connection established
       without an APN sent by the MS. The timer T3396 remains deactivated upon a PLMN change or inter-system
       change; or

   iii) if the timer value indicates that this timer is zero, the MS:

       -   shall stop timer T3396 associated with the corresponding APN, if running, and may send an ACTIVATE
           PDP CONTEXT REQUEST, ACTIVATE SECONDARY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST or MODIFY PDP
           CONTEXT REQUEST message for the same APN; and

       -   if the MS did not send an APN for the establishment of the PDN connection and the request type was
           different from "emergency", the MS shall stop timer T3396 associated with no APN, if running, and may
           send an ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message without an APN, or another ACTIVATE
           SECONDARY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST or MODIFY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message for a non-
           emergency PDN connection established without an APN sent by the MS.

If the Back-off timer value IE is not included, the MS may send an ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST,
ACTIVATE SECONDARY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST or MODIFY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message for the
same APN.

If the timer T3396 is running when the MS enters state GMM-DEREGISTERED, the MS remains switched on, and the
SIM/USIM in the MS remains the same, then timer T3396 is kept running until it expires or it is stopped.

If the MS is switched off when the timer T3396 is running, and if the SIM/USIM in the MS remains the same when the
MS is switched on, the MS behaves as follows:

   -   let t1 be the time remaining for T3396 timeout at switch off and let t be the time elapsed between switch off and
       switch on. If t1 is greater than t, then the timer shall be restarted with the value t1 – t. If t1 is equal to or less than
       t, then the timer need not be restarted. If the MS is not capable of determining t, then the MS shall restart the
       timer with the value t1; and

   -   if prior to switch off, timer T3396 was running because an ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST,
       ACTIVATE SECONDARY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST, MODIFY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST or
       ACTIVATE MBMS CONTEXT REQUEST message containing the low priority indicator set to "MS is
       configured for NAS signalling low priority" was rejected with a timer value for timer T3396, and if timer T3396
       is restarted at switch on, then the MS configured for dual priority shall handle session management requests as
       indicated in subclause 6.1.3.12.

6.1.3.2.2.3             Handling of network rejection due to SM cause other than SM cause #26

If the SM cause value is different from #26 "insufficient resources" and #65 "maximum number of PDP contexts
reached", and the Back-off timer value IE is included, the MS takes different actions depending on the timer value
received in the Back-off timer value IE (if the MS is an MS configured to use AC11 – 15 in selected PLMN, exceptions
are specified in subclause 6.1.3.13):

   i) if the timer value indicates neither zero nor deactivated, the MS shall start the back-off timer with the value
      provided in the Back-off timer value IE for the secondary PDP context activation procedure and PLMN and
      APN combination and not send another ACTIVATE SECONDARY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message in the
      PLMN for the same APN until the back-off timer expires, the MS is switched off or the SIM/USIM is removed;

   ii) if the timer value indicates that this timer is deactivated, the MS shall not send another ACTIVATE
       SECONDARY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message in the PLMN for the same APN until the MS is switched
       off or the SIM/USIM is removed; and

   iii) if the timer value indicates that this timer is zero, the MS may send an ACTIVATE SECONDARY PDP
        CONTEXT REQUEST message in the PLMN for the same APN.

If the Back-off timer value IE is not included, then the MS shall ignore the Re-attempt indicator IE provided by the
network, if any.

   i) Additionally, if the SM cause value is #32 "service option not supported", or #33 "requested service option not
      subscribed", the MS shall proceed as follows:

       -   if the MS is registered in its HPLMN or in a PLMN that is within the EHPLMN list, the MS shall behave as
           described above in the present subclause, using the configured SM_RetryWaitTime value as specified in
           3GPP TS 24.368 [135] or in USIM file NASCONFIG as specified in 3GPP TS 31.102 [112], if available, as
           back-off timer value; and

       -   otherwise, if the MS is not registered in its HPLMN or in a PLMN that is within the EHPLMN list, or if the
           SM_RetryWaitTime value is not configured, the MS shall behave as described above in the present subclause
           using the default value of 12 minutes for the back-off timer.

   ii) For SM cause values different from #32 "service option not supported", or #33 "requested service option not
       subscribed", the MS behaviour regarding the start of a back-off timer is unspecified.

The MS shall not stop any back-off timer upon a PLMN change or inter-system change. If the network indicates that a
back-off timer for the secondary PDP context activation procedure and PLMN and APN combination is deactivated,
then it remains deactivated upon a PLMN change or inter-system change.

   NOTE 1: This means the back-off timer can still be running or be deactivated for the given SM procedure and
           PLMN and APN combination when the MS returns to the PLMN or when it performs inter-system
           change back from S1 mode to A/Gb or Iu mode. Thus the MS can still be prevented from sending another
           ACTIVATE SECONDARY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message in the PLMN for the same APN.

If the back-off timer is started upon receipt of an ACTIVATE SECONDARY PDP CONTEXT REJECT message (i.e.
the timer value was provided by the network, a configured value is available or the default value is used as explained
above) or the back-off timer is deactivated, the MS behaves as follows:

   i) after a PLMN change the MS may send an ACTIVATE SECONDARY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message
      for the same APN in the new PLMN, if the back-off timer is not running and is not deactivated for the secondary
      PDP context activation procedure and the combination of new PLMN and APN;

       Furthermore as an implementation option, for the SM cause values #32 "service option not supported" or #33
       "requested service option not subscribed", if the network does not include a Re-attempt indicator IE, the MS may

      decide not to automatically send another ACTIVATE SECONDARY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message for
      the same APN, if the MS registered to a new PLMN which is in the list of equivalent PLMNs.

   ii) if the network does not include the Re-attempt indicator IE to indicate whether re-attempt in S1 mode is allowed,
       or the MS ignores the Re-attempt indicator IE, e.g. because the Back-off timer value IE is not included, then:

      -   if the MS is registered in its HPLMN or in a PLMN that is within the EHPLMN list, the MS shall apply the
          configured SM_RetryAtRATChange value as specified in 3GPP TS 24.368 [135] or in USIM file NASCONFIG
          as specified in 3GPP TS 31.102 [112], if available, to determine whether the MS may attempt a bearer
          resource allocation procedure for the same PLMN and APN combination in S1 mode; and

      -   if the MS is not registered in its HPLMN or in a PLMN that is within the EHPLMN list, or if the NAS
          configuration MO as specified in 3GPP TS 24.368 [135] is not available and the value for inter-system
          change is not configured in the USIM file NASCONFIG, then the MS behaviour regarding a bearer resource
          allocation procedure for the same PLMN and APN combination in S1 mode is unspecified; and

   iii) if the network includes the Re-attempt indicator IE indicating that re-attempt in an equivalent PLMN is not
        allowed, then depending on the timer value received in the Back-off timer value IE, for each combination of a
        PLMN from the equivalent PLMN list and the APN the MS shall start a back-off timer for the secondary PDP
        context activation procedure with the value provided by the network, or deactivate the respective back-off timer
        as follows:

      -   If the Re-attempt indicator IE additionally indicates that re-attempt in S1 mode is allowed, the MS shall start
          or deactivate the back-off timer for A/Gb and Iu mode only; and

      -   otherwise the MS shall start or deactivate the back-off timer for A/Gb, Iu, and S1 mode.

If the back-off timer for a PLMN and APN combination was started or deactivated in S1 mode upon receipt of a
BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REJECT message (see 3GPP TS 24.301 [120]) and the network indicated that
re-attempt in A/Gb or Iu mode is allowed, then this back-off timer does not prevent the MS from sending an
ACTIVATE SECONDARY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message in this PLMN for the same APN in A/Gb or Iu
mode. If the network indicated that re-attempt in A/Gb or Iu mode is not allowed, the MS shall not send any
ACTIVATE SECONDARY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message in this PLMN for the same APN in A/Gb or Iu
mode, until the timer expires, the MS is switched off or the USIM is removed.

   NOTE 2: The back-off timer is used to describe a logical model of the required MS behaviour. This model does not
           imply any specific implementation, e.g. as a timer or timestamp.

   NOTE 3: Reference to back-off timer in this section can either refer to use of timer T3396 or to use of a different
           packet system specific timer within the MS. Whether the MS uses T3396 as a back-off timer or it uses
           different packet system specific timers as back-off timers is left up to MS implementation. This back-off
           timer is stopped when the MS is switched off or the SIM/USIM is removed.

If the SM cause value is #65 "maximum number of PDP contexts reached", the MS shall determine the PLMN's
maximum number of PDP contexts in A/Gb or Iu mode (see subclause 6.1.3.0) as the number of active PDP contexts it
has. The MS shall ignore the Back-off timer value IE and Re-attempt indicator IE provided by the network, if any.

   NOTE 4: In some situations, when attempting to establish multiple PDP contexts, the number of active PDP
           contexts that the MS has when cause #65 is received is not equal to the maximum number of PDP
           contexts reached in the network.

The PLMN's maximum number of PDP context in A/Gb or Iu mode applies to the PLMN in which the SM cause #65
"maximum number of PDP contexts reached" is received. When the MS is switched off or when the USIM is removed,
the MS shall clear all previous determinations representing any PLMN's maximum number of PDP contexts in A/Gb or
Iu mode (see subclause 6.1.3.0). Upon successful registration with a new PLMN, the MS may clear previous
determinations representing any PLMN's maximum number of PDP contexts in A/Gb or Iu mode.

6.1.3.2.2a          Unsuccessful secondary PDP context activation requested by the network
Upon receipt of the REQUEST SECONDARY PDP CONTEXT ACTIVATION message, the MS may reject the
network requested secondary PDP context activation by sending the REQUEST SECONDARY PDP CONTEXT
ACTIVATION REJECT message to the network. The message contains the same TI as included in the REQUEST

SECONDARY PDP CONTEXT ACTIVATION and an additional cause code that typically indicates one of the
following causes:

      # 26: insufficient resources;

      # 31: activation rejected, unspecified;

      # 40: feature not supported;

      # 41: semantic error in the TFT operation;

      # 42: syntactical error in the TFT operation;

      # 43: unknown PDP context;

      # 44: semantic errors in packet filter(s);

      # 45: syntactical errors in packet filter(s);

      # 46: PDP context without TFT already activated;

      # 48: request rejected, Bearer Control Mode violation; or

      # 95 - 111: protocol errors.

The MS should reply with the REQUEST SECONDARY PDP CONTEXT ACTIVATION REJECT message with
cause #48 "request rejected, Bearer Control Mode violation" if the previously negotiated Bearer Control Mode is 'MS-
only'.

If a PDP context for the TI given in the Linked TI IE exists, then the TFT in the REQUEST SECONDARY PDP
CONTEXT ACTIVATION message is checked by the MS for different types of TFT IE errors as specified in
subclause 6.1.3.2.3.

Upon receipt of a REQUEST SECONDARY PDP CONTEXT ACTIVATION REJECT message, the network shall
stop timer T3385 and enter state PDP-INACTIVE.

6.1.3.2.3           Abnormal cases
The following abnormal cases can be identified:

   a) Expiry of timers

          In the mobile station:

             On the first expiry of the timer T3380, the MS shall resend the ACTIVATE SECONDARY PDP
             CONTEXT REQUEST and shall reset and restart timer T3380. This retransmission is repeated four
             times, i.e. on the fifth expiry of timer T3380, the MS shall release all resources possibly allocated for this
             invocation and shall abort the procedure; no automatic PDP context activation re-attempt shall be
             performed.

          On the network side:

             On the first expiry of the timer T3385, the network shall resend the message REQUEST SECONDARY
             PDP CONTEXT ACTIVATION and shall reset and restart timer T3385. This retransmission is repeated
             four times, i.e. on the fifth expiry of timer T3385, the network shall release possibly allocated resources
             for this activation and shall abort the procedure.

   b) MS initiated secondary PDP context activation procedure for an already activated PDP context (On the network
      side)

      If the NSAPI matches that of an already activated PDP context, the network shall deactivate the existing PDP
      context locally without notification to the MS and proceed with the requested PDP context activation. The case
      of a TI match is described in subclause 8.3.2.

   c) no PDP context with linked TI activated (on the network side)




                                                          ETSI
3GPP TS 24.008 version 15.8.0 Release 15                  342                        ETSI TS 124 008 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


         The network shall then check whether there is an activated PDP context for the TI given in the Linked TI IE
         in the ACTIVATE SECONDARY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message. If there is no active PDP context
         for the specified TI, the network shall reply with an ACTIVATE SECONDARY PDP CONTEXT REJECT
         message, cause code indicating "unknown PDP context".

   d) no PDP context with Linked TI activated (on the mobile station side)

         The MS shall check whether there is an activated PDP context for the TI given in the Linked TI IE in the
         REQUEST SECONDARY PDP CONTEXT ACTIVATION message. If there is no active PDP context for
         the specified TI, the MS shall reply with a REQUEST SECONDARY PDP CONTEXT ACTIVATION
         REJECT message, cause code indicating "unknown PDP context".

   e) MS initiated secondary PDP context activation procedure for a PDN connection established for emergency
      bearer services (on the network side)

         If the MS initiated secondary PDP context activation procedure is for a PDN connection established for
         emergency bearer services the network shall reply with an ACTIVATE SECONDARY PDP CONTEXT
         REJECT message, cause code indicating "activation rejected, unspecified".

   f) no TFT IE is received in the REQUEST SECONDARY PDP CONTEXT ACTIVATION message (on the
      mobile station side)

         The MS shall either:

         A) reply with a REQUEST SECONDARY PDP CONTEXT ACTIVATION REJECT message, cause code
            indicating "semantic error in the TFT operation"; or

         B) optionally, to support networks compliant with earlier versions of the protocol, accept the network
            requested secondary PDP context activation and proceed as specified in subclause 6.1.3.2.1a. If another
            PDP context with the same PDP address and APN without a TFT exists, the MS shall deactivate this old
            PDP context without a TFT by explicit peer-to-peer signalling between the MS and the network.

         If during a previous inter-system change from S1 mode to A/Gb or Iu mode the default PDP context linked to
         the new PDP context was mapped from an EPS bearer context, the MS shall follow option A.

   NOTE 1: A network implementing this version of the protocol will always include a request for a TFT when
           requesting the activation of a non-default PDP context.

If a PDP context for the TI given in the Linked TI IE exists, then the TFT in the ACTIVATE SECONDARY PDP
CONTEXT REQUEST or the REQUEST SECONDARY PDP CONTEXT ACTIVATION message is checked for
different types of TFT IE errors as follows:

      a) Semantic errors in TFT operations:

             1) When the TFT operation is an operation other than "Create a new TFT".

         The network shall reject the activation request with cause "semantic error in the TFT operation".

         The MS shall reject the activation request with cause "semantic error in the TFT operation".

      b) Syntactical errors in TFT operations:

             1) When the TFT operation is "Create a new TFT" and the packet filter list in the TFT IE is empty.

             2) Void.

             3) When there are other types of syntactical errors in the coding of the TFT IE, such as a mismatch
                between the number of packet filters subfield, and the number of packet filters in the packet filter list.

         The network shall reject the activation request with cause "syntactical error in the TFT operation".

         The MS shall reject the activation request with cause "syntactical error in the TFT operation".

      c) Semantic errors in packet filters:




                                                          ETSI
3GPP TS 24.008 version 15.8.0 Release 15                    343                        ETSI TS 124 008 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


             1) When a packet filter consists of conflicting packet filter components which would render the packet
                filter ineffective, i.e. no IP packet will ever fit this packet filter. How the network determines a
                semantic error in a packet filter is outside the scope of the present document.

             2) When the resulting TFT does not contain any packet filter applicable for the uplink direction.

   NOTE 2: When BCM='MS only', the MS is allowed to include a TFT with packet filters without any explicit
           direction information, i.e. with value "00", and such packet filters are applicable for both uplink and
           downlink directions.

          The network shall reject the activation request with cause "semantic errors in packet filter(s)".

          The MS shall reject the activation request with cause "semantic errors in packet filter(s)".

      d) Syntactical errors in packet filters:

             1) When the TFT operation is "Create a new TFT" and two or more packet filters in the resultant TFT
                would have identical packet filter identifiers.

             2) When the TFT operation is "Create a new TFT" and two or more packet filters in all TFTs associated
                with this PDP address and APN would have identical packet filter precedence values.

             3) When there are other types of syntactical errors in the coding of packet filters, such as the use of a
                reserved value for a packet filter component identifier.

          In case 2) the network shall not diagnose an error, further process the new activation request and, if it was
          processed successfully, delete the old packet filters which have identical filter precedence values.
          Furthermore, by means of explicit peer-to-peer signalling between the MS and the network, the network shall
          deactivate the PDP context(s) for which it has deleted the packet filters.

          In cases 1) and 3) the network shall reject the activation request with cause "syntactical errors in packet
          filter(s)".

          In case 2) the MS shall not diagnose an error, further process the new activation request and, if it was
          processed successfully, delete the old packet filters which have identical filter precedence values.
          Furthermore, by means of explicit peer-to-peer signalling between the network and the MS, the MS shall
          deactivate the PDP context(s) for which it has deleted the packet filters.

          In cases 1) and 3) the MS shall reject the activation request with cause "syntactical errors in packet filter(s)".

Otherwise, the network shall accept the activation request by replying to the MS with an ACTIVATE SECONDARY
PDP CONTEXT ACCEPT message. In case of network requested secondary PDP context activation procedure the MS
shall accept the activation request by replying to the network with an ACTIVATE SECONDARY PDP CONTEXT
REQUEST message.

6.1.3.3           PDP context modification procedure
The PDP context modification procedure is invoked by the network or by the MS, in order to:

   -    inform about the change of the 3GPP PS data off UE status for a PDN connection;

   -    change the QoS negotiated;

   -    change the Radio priority level; or

   -    change the TFT,

negotiated during the PDP context activation procedure, the secondary PDP context activation procedure or at
previously performed PDP context modification procedures. Depending on the selected Bearer Control Mode being 'MS
only' or 'MS/NW', the MS or the network respectively may also create and delete a TFT of an active default PDP
context. The PDP context modification procedure can be initiated by the network or the MS at any time when a PDP
context is active. The network and the MS shall manage packet filter identifiers for the packet filters each modifies or
deletes. The network and the MS shall manage packet filter evaluation precedence for the packet filters each modifies.If
the MS changes a TFT, which is not assigned to a default PDP context, the MS shall ensure that at least one packet filter
applicable for the uplink direction remains among the packet filters created by the MS in that TFT, or no own packet
filters . If the network changes a TFT, which is not ass igned to a default PDP context, the network shall ensure that at
least one packet filter applicable for the uplink direction remains among the TFT packet filters created by the network in
that TFT, or no own packet filters. The MS supporting S1 mode shall not modify the QoS of the first PDP context that
was established within the PDN connection. The MS not supporting S1 mode should not modify the QoS of the first
PDP context that was established within the PDN connection (see 3GPP TS 23.060 [74]).

To indicate a change of 3GPP PS data off UE status for a PDN connection, the MS shall include the protocol
configuration options IE in the MODIFY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message and set the 3GPP PS data off UE status
only if the network included the 3GPP PS data off support indication for the PDN connection established by the PDP
context activation procedure. The MS behaves as described in subclause 4.7.1.10.




                                                          ETSI
3GPP TS 24.008 version 15.8.0 Release 15                     345                         ETSI TS 124 008 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


When the PDP context modification procedure is used to indicate a change of 3GPP PS data off UE status for a PDN
connection (see subclause 4.7.1.10), the UE shall initiate the PDP context modification procedure even if the timer
T3396 or the back-off timer is running or is deactivated.

The PDP context modification procedure may also be invoked by the MS, in order to upgrade the maximum bit rate and
to trigger the re-establishment of the radio access bearer for an activated PDP context which is preserved in the MS with
maximum bit rate values of 0kbit/s for both uplink and downlink (see 3GPP TS 23.060 [74]).

     NOTE 1: As described in 3GPP TS 23.060 [74], the MS only preserves PDP contexts with a TFT including packet
             filter(s) set by the MS.

If

     -   the PDP Context Modification request is accepted by the network but the radio access bearer is not established;
         or

     -   the PDP Context Modification request is rejected with cause "insufficient resources" (see subclause 6.1.3.3.3),

then the MS is not required to start a new PDP Context Modification procedure or to start a Service Request procedure
in order to trigger the re-establishment of the radio access bearer.

If there is a PDN connection for emergency bearer services established, the MS shall not request a modification of
bearer resources for this PDN connection.

The network requested PDP context modification procedure may also be used to update the PDP address when external
PDP address allocation is performed, in which case the MS receives the PDP address in the MODIFY PDP CONTEXT
REQUEST (Network to MS direction) message.

     NOTE 2: The procedure may be initiated by the network due to an inter-SGSN Routing Area Updating when a PDP
             context is active.

The network requested PDP context modification procedure may also be used to update the WLAN offload indication,
in which case the MS receives the updated WLAN offload indication in the MODIFY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST
(Network to MS direction) message.

6.1.3.3.1              Network initiated PDP Context Modification
In order to initiate the procedure, the network sends the MODIFY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message to the MS and
starts timer T3386. The message shall contain the new QoS and the radio priority level and LLC SAPI that shall be used
by the MS in A/Gb mode at the lower layers for the transmission of data related to the PDP context. The MODIFY PDP
CONTEXT REQUEST message may also contain packet filters in the TFT information element. If the selected Bearer
Control Mode is 'MS/NW' and the TFT information element is included in the MODIFY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST
message, the network shall include packet filter(s), or if no packet filters are proposed to be either added, replaced or
deleted, it shall set TFT operation code to "No TFT operation" and include packet filter identifier(s) in the Packet filter
identifier parameter in the parameters list to indicate which packet filter(s) in the TFT is associated with the QoS
change. If the TFT information element is included in the MODIFY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message and packet
filter(s) is proposed to be added, the network shall allocate packet filter identifier(s) for all packet filters to be added to
the TFT. The network shall allocate packet filter identifier value s which are currently not allocated to any existing
packet filter of the same TFT.

The network informs the MS about the Bearer Control Mode to be applied for all active PDP contexts sharing the same
PDP Address and APN by including the selected Bearer Control Mode parameter in the protocol configuration options
information element. This information is either explicitly given in the MODIFY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message
or implicitly given by not being present. The MS shall act according to the presence of the protocol configuration
options information element and the value of the selected Bearer Control Mode parameter in the MODIFY PDP
CONTEXT REQUEST message:

     -   if the protocol configuration options information element is not present, the MS shall apply Bearer Control Mode
         'MS only' for all active PDP contexts sharing the same PDP Address and APN.

     -   if the selected Bearer Control Mode parameter is not present in the protocol configuration options information
         element, the MS shall apply Bearer Control Mode 'MS only' for all active PDP contexts sharing the same PDP
         Address and APN.

   -   if the selected Bearer Control Mode parameter is present in the protocol configuration options information
       element, the MS shall apply Bearer Control Mode according to the value of this parameter for all active PDP
       contexts sharing the same PDP Address and APN.

If a WLAN offload indication information element is included in the MODIFY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message,
the MS shall replace stored WLAN offload acceptability values for this PDN connection with the newly received
offload indications and use the UTRAN offload acceptability value to determine whether this PDN connection is
offloadable to WLAN or not.

Upon receipt of the MODIFY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message, if the MS sent an APN for the establishment of the
PDN connection, the MS shall stop the timer T3396 if it is running for the APN sent by the MS.If the MS did not send
an APN for the establishment of the PDN connection and the request type was different from "emergency", the MS
shall stop the timer T3396 associated with no APN if it is running. If the MODIFY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST
message was received for an emergency PDN connection, the MS shall not stop the timer T3396 associated with no
APN if it is running. For any case, the MS shall then reply with the MODIFY PDP CONTEXT ACCEPT message, if
the MS accepts the new QoS and the indicated LLC SAPI.

The network shall upon receipt of the MODIFY PDP CONTEXT ACCEPT message stop timer T3386.

In A/Gb mode, the network shall establish, reconfigure or continue using the logical link with the new QoS for the LLC
SAPI indicated in the MODIFY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message.

In Iu mode, if the Radio Access Bearer supporting the PDP context is active, then the network shall reconfigure and
continue using the Radio Access Bearer with the new QoS indicated in the MODIFY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST
message; if the PDP context is preserved, then the network may re-establish a Radio Access Bearer with the new QoS
indicated in the MODIFY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message.

6.1.3.3.2             MS initiated PDP Context Modification accepted by the network
In order to initiate the procedure, the MS sends the MODIFY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message to the network,
enters the state PDP-MODIFY-PENDING and starts timer T3381. The message may contain the requested new QoS
and/or the TFT and the requested LLC SAPI (used in A/Gb mode). If the selected Bearer Control Mode is 'MS/NW' and
the MS wants to modify the QoS, it shall include a TFT with packet filter(s), or if no packet filters are proposed to be
either added, replaced or deleted, it shall set TFT operation code to "No TFT operation" and include packet filter
identifier(s) in the Packet filter identifier parameter in the parameters list to indicate which packet filter(s) in the TFT is
associated with the QoS change. If the TFT information element is included in the MODIFY PDP CONTEXT
REQUEST message and packet filters are proposed to be added, the MS shall allocate packet filter identifier(s) for all
packet filters to be added to the TFT. The MS shall allocate packet filter identifier value s which are currently not
allocated to any existing packet filter of the TFT. If a PDP context is associated with a TFT containing packet filters
established by both the MS and the network, the only parameters in the QoS profile of that PDP context the MS is
allowed to modify are the bitrate parameters.

Upon receipt of the MODIFY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message, the network may reply with the MODIFY PDP
CONTEXT ACCEPT message in order to accept the context modification. The reply message may contain the
negotiated QoS and the radio priority level based on the new QoS profile and the negotiated LLC SAPI that shall be
used in A/Gb mode by the logical link.

Upon receipt of the MODIFY PDP CONTEXT ACCEPT message, the MS shall stop the timer T3381. If the offered
QoS parameters received from the network differs from the QoS requested by the MS, the MS shall either accept the
negotiated QoS or initiate the PDP context deactivation procedure.

If a modification of QoS is requested by the MS, which the network can not accept, being unable to provide the
requested QoS, it should maintain the QoS negotiated as previously negotiated or propose a new QoS. That means that
the network should not reject the MS initiated PDP context modification request due to the unavailability of the QoS. If
the MS requested a value for a QoS parameter that is not within the range specified by 3GPP TS 23.107[81], the
network should negotiate the parameter to a value that lies within the specified range.

6.1.3.3.3.1              General

Upon receipt of a MODIFY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message, the network may reject the MS initiated PDP
context modification request by sending a MODIFY PDP CONTEXT REJECT message to the MS. The message shall
contain a cause code that typically indicates one of the following:

   # 26: insufficient resources;

   # 30: activation rejected by GGSN, Serving GW or PDN GW;

   # 32: Service option not supported;

   # 37: QoS not accepted;

   # 41: semantic error in the TFT operation;

   # 42: syntactical error in the TFT operation;

   # 44: semantic errors in packet filter(s);

   # 45: syntactical errors in packet filter(s);

   # 48: request rejected, Bearer Control Mode violation;

   # 60: bearer handling not supported; or

   # 95 - 111:    protocol errors.

If upon the reception of a MODIFY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message the network fails to re-establish the radio
access bearer for a PDP context whose maximum bit rate in uplink and downlink is set to 0kbit/s, the network shall
reply with a MODIFY PDP CONTEXT REJECT message with cause #26 "insufficient resources".

If a TFT modification was requested and the requested TFT is not available, then the MODIFY PDP CONTEXT
REJECT message shall be sent.

The network shall reply with a MODIFY PDP CONTEXT REJECT message with cause #48 "request rejected, Bearer
Control Mode violation", if

   -   the selected Bearer Control Mode is 'MS/NW' and the MS requests to create a TFT for a PDP context that was
       established without TFT;

   -   the selected Bearer Control Mode is 'MS/NW' and the MS requests to upgrade the QoS of a PDP context without
       downlink packet filters, unless uplink packet filters already exist for the PDP context and the MS requests with
       the same MODIFY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message to create downlink packet filters ;

   -   the selected Bearer Control Mode is 'MS/NW' and the MS requests to modify the QoS, but does not include a
       TFT with at least apacket filter identifiers to indicate which packet filters in the TFT that is associated with the
       QoS change; or

   -   the selected Bearer Control Mode is 'MS/NW' and the MS requests to modify the QoS for a PDP context
       associated with a TFT containing packet filters established by both the MS and the network and the MS tries to
       modify other parameters than the bitrate parameters in the QoS profile of that PDP context.

If a TFT modification was requested and the MS requests to modify or delete packet filters which were added by the
network, then the MODIFY PDP CONTEXT REJECT message shall be sent.

If the MS has requested to modify the QoS of a default PDP context, the network shall reply with a MODIFY PDP
CONTEXT REJECT message with cause code "QoS not accepted".

If the MS has requested to modify the PDP context of a LIPA PDN connection or SIPTO at the local network PDN
connection, then the network shall reply with a MODIFY PDP CONTEXT REJECT message with cause code "bearer
handling not supported".

The network may include a Back-off timer value IE in the MODIFY PDP CONTEXT REJECT message.

The network shall not include the SM cause value #26 "insufficient resources" in the MODIFY PDP CONTEXT
REJECT message due to APN based congestion control being active.

If the Back-off timer value IE is included and the SM cause value is not #26 "insufficient resources", the network may
include the Re-attempt indicator IE to indicate whether the MS is allowed to attempt a bearer resource modification
procedure in the PLMN for the same APN in S1 mode, and whether another attempt in A/Gb and Iu mode or in S1
mode is allowed in an equivalent PLMN.

Upon receipt of a MODIFY PDP CONTEXT REJECT message, the MS shall stop timer T3381 and enter the state
PDP-ACTIVE.

6.1.3.3.3.2              Handling of network rejection due to SM cause #26

If the SM cause value is #26 and the Back-off timer value IE is included, the MS shall ignore the Re-attempt indicator
IE provided by the network, if any, and take different actions depending on the timer value received for timer T3396 in
the Back-off timer value IE (if the MS is configured for dual priority, exceptions are specified in subclause 6.1.3.12; if
the MS is an MS configured to use AC11 – 15 in selected PLMN, exceptions are specified in subclause 6.1.3.11):

   i) if the timer value indicates neither zero nor deactivated, the MS shall stop timer T3396 associated with the
      corresponding APN, if it is running. The MS shall then start timer T3396 with the value provided in the Back-off
      timer value IE and not send another ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST, ACTIVATE SECONDARY PDP
      CONTEXT REQUEST or MODIFY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message with exception of those identified in
      subclause 6.1.3.3, for the same APN until timer T3396 expires or timer T3396 is stopped. If the MS did not send
      an APN for the establishment of the PDN connection and the request type was different from "emergency", the
      MS shall stop timer T3396 associated with no APN, if it is running. The MS shall then start timer T3396 with
      the value provided in the Back-off timer value IE and not send another ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST
      without an APN and with request type different from "emergency", or another ACTIVATE SECONDARY PDP
      CONTEXT REQUEST or MODIFY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message with exception of those identified in
      subclause 6.1.3.3, for a non-emergency PDN connection established without an APN sent by the MS, until timer
      T3396 expires or timer T3396 is stopped. The MS shall not stop timer T3396 upon a PLMN change or inter-
      system change;

   ii) if the timer value indicates that this timer is deactivated, the MS shall not send another ACTIVATE PDP
       CONTEXT REQUEST, ACTIVATE SECONDARY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST or MODIFY PDP CONTEXT
       REQUEST message with exception of those identified in subclause 6.1.3.3, for the same APN until the MS is
       switched off or the SIM/USIM is removed or the MS receives REQUEST PDP CONTEXT ACTIVATION,
       REQUEST SECONDARY PDP CONTEXT ACTIVATION or MODIFY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message
       for the same APN or a DEACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message including SM cause #39
       "reactivation requested" for a PDP context which was activated by the MS for the same APN from the network.
       If the MS did not send an APN for the establishment of the PDN connection and the request type was different
       from "emergency", the MS shall not send another ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST without an APN and
       with request type different from "emergency", or another ACTIVATE SECONDARY PDP CONTEXT
       REQUEST or MODIFY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST with exception of those identified in subclause 6.1.3.3, for
       a non-emergency PDN connection established without APN sent by the MS, until the MS is switched off or the
       SIM/USIM is removed or the MS receives any of the following messages: a REQUEST PDP CONTEXT
       ACTIVATION without an APN, a REQUEST SECONDARY PDP CONTEXT ACTIVATION or MODIFY
       PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message for a non-emergency PDN connection established without an APN sent by
       the MS, or a DEACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message including SM cause #39 "reactivation
       requested" for a PDP context which was activated by the MS for a non-emergency PDN connection established
       without an APN sent by the MS. The timer T3396 remains deactivated upon a PLMN change or inter-system
       change; or

   iii) if the timer value indicates that this timer is zero, the MS:

       -   shall stop timer T3396 associated with the corresponding APN, if running, and may send an ACTIVATE
           PDP CONTEXT REQUEST, ACTIVATE SECONDARY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST or MODIFY PDP
           CONTEXT REQUEST message for the same APN; and

3GPP TS 24.008 version 15.8.0 Release 15                      349                          ETSI TS 124 008 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


       -   if the MS did not send an APN for the establishment of the PDN connection and the request type was
           different from "emergency", the MS shall stop timer T3396 associated with no APN, if running, and may
           send an ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message without an APN, or another ACTIVATE
           SECONDARY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST or MODIFY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message for a non-
           emergency PDN connection established without an APN sent by the MS.

If the Back-off timer value IE is not included, the MS may send an ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST,
ACTIVATE SECONDARY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST or MODIFY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message for the
same APN.

If the timer T3396 is running when the MS enters state GMM-DEREGISTERED, the MS remains switched on, and the
SIM/USIM in the MS remains the same, then timer T3396 is kept running until it expires or it is stopped.

If the MS is switched off when the timer T3396 is running, and if the SIM/USIM in the MS remains the same when the
MS is switched on, the MS behaves as follows:

   -   let t1 be the time remaining for T3396 timeout at switch off and let t be the time elapsed between switch off and
       switch on. If t1 is greater than t, then the timer shall be restarted with the value t1 – t. If t1 is equal to or less than
       t, then the timer need not be restarted. If the MS is not capable of determining t, then the MS shall restart the
       timer with the value t1; and

   -   if prior to switch off, timer T3396 was running because an ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST,
       ACTIVATE SECONDARY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST, MODIFY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST or
       ACTIVATE MBMS CONTEXT REQUEST message containing the low priority indicator set to "MS is
       configured for NAS signalling low priority" was rejected with a timer value for timer T3396, and if timer T3396
       is restarted at switch on, then the MS configured for dual priority shall handle session management requests as
       indicated in subclause 6.1.3.12.

6.1.3.3.3.3               Handling of network rejection due to SM cause other than SM cause #26

If the SM cause value is not #26 "insufficient resources" and the Back-off timer value IE is included, the MS takes
different actions depending on the timer value received in the Back-off timer value IE (if the MS is an MS configured to
use AC11 – 15 in selected PLMN, exceptions are specified in subclause 6.1.3.13):

   i) if the timer value indicates neither zero nor deactivated, the MS shall start the back-off timer with the value
      provided in the Back-off timer value IE for the PDP context modification procedure and PLMN and APN
      combination and not send another MODIFY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message with exception of those
      identified in subclause 6.1.3.3, in the PLMN for the same APN until the back-off timer expires, the MS is
      switched off or the SIM/USIM is removed;

   ii) if the timer value indicates that this timer is deactivated, the MS shall not send another MODIFY PDP
       CONTEXT REQUEST message with exception of those identified in subclause 6.1.3.3, in the PLMN for the
       same APN until the MS is switched off or the SIM/USIM is removed; or

   iii) if the timer value indicates that this timer is zero, the MS may send an MODIFY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST
        message in the PLMN for the same APN.

If the Back-off timer value IE is not included, then the MS shall ignore the Re-attempt indicator IE provided by the
network, if any.

   i) Additionally, if the SM cause value is #32 "service option not supported", or #33 "requested service option not
      subscribed", the MS shall proceed as follows:

       -   if the MS is registered in its HPLMN or in a PLMN that is within the EHPLMN list, the MS shall behave as
           described above in the present subclause, using the configured SM_RetryWaitTime value as specified in
           3GPP TS 24.368 [135] or in USIM file NASCONFIG as specified in 3GPP TS 31.102 [112], if available, as
           back-off timer value; and

       -   otherwise, if the MS is not registered in its HPLMN or in a PLMN that is within the EHPLMN list, or if the
           SM_RetryWaitTime value is not configured, the MS shall behave as described above in the present
           subclause, using the default value of 12 minutes for the back-off timer.

   ii) For SM cause values different from #32 "service option not supported", or #33 "requested service option not
       subscribed", the MS behaviour regarding the start of a back-off timer is unspecified.




                                                              ETSI
3GPP TS 24.008 version 15.8.0 Release 15                   350                        ETSI TS 124 008 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


The MS shall not stop any back-off timer upon a PLMN change or inter-system change. If the network indicates that a
back-off timer for the PDP context modification procedure and PLMN and APN combination is deactivated, then it
remains deactivated upon a PLMN change or inter-system change.

   NOTE 1: This means the back-off timer can still be running or be deactivated for the given SM procedure and
           PLMN and APN combination when the MS returns to the PLMN or when it performs inter-system
           change back from S1 mode to A/Gb or Iu mode. Thus the MS can still be prevented from sending another
           MODIFY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message with exception of those identified in subclause 6.1.3.3, in
           the PLMN for the same APN.

If the back-off timer is started upon receipt of a MODIFY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message (i.e. the timer value
was provided by the network, a configured value is available or the default value is used as explained above) or the
back-off timer is deactivated, the MS behaves as follows:

   i) after a PLMN change the MS may send a MODIFY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message for the same APN in
      the new PLMN, if the back-off timer is not running and is not deactivated for the PDP context modification
      procedure and the combination of new PLMN and APN;

       Furthermore as an implementation option, for the SM cause values #32 "service option not supported" or #33
       "requested service option not subscribed", if the network does not include a Re-attempt indicator IE, the MS may
       decide not to automatically send another MODIFY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message for the same APN, if
       the MS registered to a new PLMN which is in the list of equivalent PLMNs.

   ii) if the network does not include the Re-attempt indicator IE to indicate whether re-attempt in S1 mode is allowed,
       or the MS ignores the Re-attempt indicator IE, e.g. because the Back-off timer value IE is not included, then:

       -   if the MS is registered in its HPLMN or in a PLMN that is within the EHPLMN list, the MS shall apply the
           configured SM_RetryAtRATChange value as specified in 3GPP TS 24.368 [135] or in USIM file NASCONFIG
           as specified in 3GPP TS 31.102 [112], if available, to determine whether the MS may attempt a bearer
           resource modification procedure for the same PLMN and APN combination in S1 mode; and

       -   if the MS is not registered in its HPLMN or in a PLMN that is within the EHPLMN list, or if the NAS
           configuration MO as specified in 3GPP TS 24.368 [135] is not available and the value for inter-system
           change is not configured in the USIM file NASCONFIG, then the MS behaviour regarding a bearer resource
           modification procedure for the same PLMN and APN combination in S1 mode is unspecified; and

   iii) if the network includes the Re-attempt indicator IE indicating that re-attempt in an equivalent PLMN is not
        allowed, then depending on the timer value received in the Back-off timer value IE, for each combination of a
        PLMN from the equivalent PLMN list and the APN the MS shall start a back-off timer for the PDP context
        modification procedure with the value provided by the network, or deactivate the respective back-off timer as
        follows:

       -   If the Re-attempt indicator IE additionally indicates that re-attempt in S1 mode is allowed, the MS shall start
           or deactivate the back-off timer for A/Gb and Iu mode only; and

       -   otherwise the MS shall start or deactivate the back-off timer for A/Gb, Iu, and S1 mode.

If the back-off timer for a PLMN and APN combination was started or deactivated in S1 mode upon receipt of a
BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REJECT message (see 3GPP TS 24.301 [120]) and the network indicated
that re-attempt in A/Gb or Iu mode is allowed, then this back-off timer does not prevent the MS from sending a
MODIFY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message in this PLMN for the same APN in A/Gb or Iu mode. If the network
indicated that re-attempt in A/Gb or Iu mode is not allowed, the MS shall not send any MODIFY PDP CONTEXT
REQUEST message in this PLMN for the same APN in A/Gb or Iu mode until the timer expires, the MS is switched off
or the USIM is removed.

   NOTE 2: The back-off timer is used to describe a logical model of the required MS behaviour. This model does not
           imply any specific implementation, e.g. as a timer or timestamp.

   NOTE 3: Reference to back-off timer in this section can either refer to use of timer T3396 or to use of a different
           packet system specific timer within the MS. Whether the MS uses T3396 as a back-off timer or it uses
           different packet system specific timers as back-off timers is left up to MS implementation. This back-off
           timer is stopped when the MS is switched off or the SIM/USIM is removed.

6.1.3.3.3a           Network initiated PDP Context Modification not accepted by the MS
Upon receipt of a MODIFY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message, if the MS does not accept the new QoS due to
resource reasons or the indicated LLC SAPI, the MS shall initiate the PDP context deactivation procedure for the PDP
context - the reject cause IE value of the DEACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message shall indicate "QoS not
accepted".

The MS may reject the network initiated PDP context modification request by sending a MODIFY PDP CONTEXT
REJECT message to the network. The message shall contain a cause code that typically indicates one of the following:

   # 41: semantic error in the TFT operation;

   # 42: syntactical error in the TFT operation;

   # 44: semantic errors in packet filter(s);

   # 45: syntactical errors in packet filter(s);

   # 48: request rejected, Bearer Control Mode violation; or

   # 95 - 111:   protocol errors.

The MS shall reply with a MODIFY PDP CONTEXT REJECT message with cause "request rejected, Bearer Control
Mode violation", if the selected Bearer Control Mode is 'MS only' and the network requests to modify or delete a TFT

If a TFT modification was requested and the network requests to modify or delete packet filters which were added by
the MS, then the MODIFY PDP CONTEXT REJECT message shall be sent.

The TFT in the request message is checked by the MS for different types of TFT IE errors as specified in
subclause 6.1.3.3.4.

Upon receipt of a MODIFY PDP CONTEXT REJECT message, the network shall stop timer T3386 and enter the state
PDP-ACTIVE.

6.1.3.3.4            Abnormal cases
   a) Expiry of timers

       On the network side:

          On the first expiry of timer T3386, the network shall resend the MODIFY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST
          message reset and restart timer T3386. This retransmission is repeated four times, i.e. on the fifth expiry of
          timer T3386, the network may continue to use the previously negotiated QoS and TFT, or it may initiate the
          PDP context deactivation procedure.

       In the MS:

          On the first expiry of timer T3381, the MS shall resend the MODIFY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message
          reset and restart timer T3381. This retransmission is repeated four times, i.e. on the fifth expiry of timer
          T3381, the MS may continue to use the previously negotiated QoS and TFT, or it may initiate the PDP
          context deactivation procedure.

   b) Collision of MS and Network initiated PDP Context Modification Procedures

       A collision of a MS and network initiated PDP context modification procedures is identified by the MS if a
       MODIFY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message is received from the network after the MS has sent a MODIFY
       PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message itself, and both messages contain the same TI and the MS has not yet
       received a MODIFY PDP CONTEXT ACCEPT message from the network.

       A collision is detected by the network in case a MODIFY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message is received from
       the MS with the same TI as the MODIFY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message sent to the MS.

       In the case of such a collision, the network initiated PDP context modification shall take precedence over the MS
       initiated PDP context modification. The MS shall terminate internally the MS initiated PDP context modification
       procedure, enter the state PDP-Active and proceed with the network initiated PDP context modification
       procedure by sending a MODIFY PDP CONTEXT ACCEPT message. The network shall ignore the MODIFY

3GPP TS 24.008 version 15.8.0 Release 15                  352                        ETSI TS 124 008 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


      PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message received in the state PDP-MODIFY-PENDING. The network shall
      proceed with the network initiated PDP context modification procedure as if no MODIFY PDP CONTEXT
      REQUEST message was received from the MS.

   c) Collision of MS initiated PDP Context Modification Procedures and Network initiated Deactivate PDP Context
       Request Procedures

      A collision of a MS initiated PDP context modification procedures and a network initiated PDP context
      deactivation procedures is identified by the MS if a DEACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message is
      received from the network after the MS has sent a MODIFY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message, and the MS
      has not yet received a MODIFY PDP CONTEXT ACCEPT message from the network.

      In the case of such a collision, the network initiated PDP context deactivation shall take precedence over the MS
      initiated PDP context modification. The MS shall terminate internally the MS initiated PDP context modification
      procedure, and proceed with the network initiated PDP context deactivation procedure by sending a
      DEACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT ACCEPT, enter the state PDP-INACTIVE. The network shall ignore the
      MODIFY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message received in the state PDP-INACTIVE-PENDING. The network
      shall proceed with the network initiated PDP context deactivation procedure as if no MODIFY PDP CONTEXT
      REQUEST message was received from the MS.

   d) MS initiated PDP context modification procedure for a PDN connection established for emergency bearer
      services.

      The network shall reply with a MODIFY PDP CONTEXT REJECT message with a cause code indicating
      "activation rejected by GGSN, Serving GW or PDN GW".

The TFT in the MODIFY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message is checked for different types of TFT IE errors as
follows:

   a) Semantic errors in TFT operations:

      1) When the TFT operation is "Create a new TFT" and there is already an existing TFT for the PDP context.

      2) When the TFT operation is an operation other than "Create a new TFT" and there is no TFT for the PDP
         context.

      3) When the TFT operation is "Delete existing TFT" and the TFT includes packet filters created by the receiver
         of the request.

      4) When the TFT operation is "Delete existing TFT" and there is already another PDP context with the same
         PDP address and APN without a TFT.

      5) When the TFT operation is "Delete existing TFT" and the PDP context is not the default PDP context.

      6) When the TFT operation is "Delete packet filters from existing TFT" or "Replace packet filters in existing
         TFT" and at least one of the packet filters to be deleted or replaced was created by the receiver of the request.

      7) When the TFT operation is "Delete packet filters from existing TFT" and this operation would render the
         TFT empty.

      In the above cases the network shall perform the following actions:

      In case 1) the network shall further process the new activation request and, if it was processed successfully,
      delete the old TFT.

      In case 2) the network shall:

      -   further process the new request and, if no error according to list items b), c), and d) was detected, consider
          the TFT as successfully deleted, if the TFT operation is "Delete existing TFT" or "Delete packet filters from
          existing TFT"; and

      -   process the new request as an activation request, if the TFT operation is "Add packet filters in existing TFT"
          or "Replace packet filters in existing TFT".

      In case 3) the network shall reject the modification request with cause "semantic error in the TFT operation".

       In case 4) the network shall either:

       -   reject the modification request with cause "semantic error in the TFT operation"; or

       -   optionally, if the BCM is "MS only" and the packet filters in the TFT do not have any explicit direction
           information, i.e. the packet filter direction parameter is set to "00", process the new deletion request and, after
           successful deletion of the TFT, deactivate the old PDP context with the same PDP address and APN without
           a TFT by explicit peer-to-peer signalling between the MS and the network.

   -   In case 5) the network shall either:

       -   reject the modification request with cause "semantic error in the TFT operation"; or

       -   optionally, if the BCM is "MS only" and the packet filters in the TFT do not have any explicit direction
           information, i.e. the packet filter direction parameter is set to "00", process the new deletion request.

       In case 6) the network shall reject the modification request with cause "semantic error in the TFT operation".

       In case 7) the network shall:

       i) if the PDP context is the default PDP context, further process the new request and, if no error according to
          list items b), c), and d) was detected, delete the existing TFT. After successful deletion of the TFT, if there
          was already another PDP context with the same PDP address and APN without a TFT, the network shall
          deactivate this old PDP context without a TFT by explicit peer-to-peer signalling between the MS and the
          network; and

       ii) if the PDP context is not the default PDP context, further process the new request and, if no error according
           to list items b), c), and d) was detected, delete the existing TFT. After successful deletion of the TFT, the
           network shall deactivate the modified PDP context by explicit peer-to-peer signalling between the MS and
           the network. The network need not respond with a Modify PDP Context Accept message.

       In the above cases the MS shall perform the following actions:

       In case 1) the MS shall further process the new activation request and, if it was processed successfully, delete the
       old TFT.

       In case 2) the MS shall:

       -   further process the new request and, if no error according to list items b), c), and d) was detected, consider
           the TFT as successfully deleted, if the TFT operation is "Delete existing TFT" or "Delete packet filters from
           existing TFT"; and

       -   process the new request as an activation request, if the TFT operation is "Add packet filters in existing TFT"
           or "Replace packet filters in existing TFT".

       In case 3) the MS shall reject the modification request with cause "semantic error in the TFT operation".

       In case 4) the MS shall either:

       A) reject the modification request with cause "semantic error in the TFT operation"; or

       B) optionally, to support networks compliant with earlier versions of the protocol, process the new deletion
          request and, after successful deletion of the TFT, deactivate the old PDP context with the same PDP address
          and APN without a TFT by explicit peer-to-peer signalling between the MS and the network.

   NOTE 1: This case is not expected to occur for a network implementing this version of the protocol, because at
           least one of the two PDP contexts without TFT will be a non-default PDP context. But for Bearer Control
           Mode 'MS/NW' such a network does not support an initial configuration where the old PDP context
           without TFT is a non-default PDP context, and the network will not attempt to delete the TFT of a non-
           default PDP context.

       If during a previous inter-system change from S1 mode to A/Gb or Iu mode the default PDP context linked to the
       PDP context to be modified was mapped from an EPS bearer context, the MS shall follow option A.

       In case 5) the MS shall either:

3GPP TS 24.008 version 15.8.0 Release 15                   354                        ETSI TS 124 008 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


      A) reject the modification request with cause "semantic error in the TFT operation"; or

      B) optionally, to support networks compliant with earlier versions of the protocol, process the new deletion
         request.

   NOTE 2: A network implementing this version of the protocol will not attempt to delete the TFT of a non-default
           PDP context.

      If during a previous inter-system change from S1 mode to A/Gb or Iu mode the default PDP context linked to the
      PDP context to be modified was mapped from an EPS bearer context, the MS shall follow option A.

      In case 6) the MS shall reject the modification request with cause "semantic error in the TFT operation".

      In case 7) the MS shall:

      i) if the PDP context is the default PDP context, further process the new request and, if no error according to
         list items b), c), and d) was detected, delete the existing TFT. After successful deletion of the TFT, if there
         was already another PDP context with the same PDP address and APN without a TFT, the MS shall
         deactivate this old PDP context without a TFT by explicit peer-to-peer signalling between the MS and the
         network; and

      ii) if the PDP context is not the default PDP context, either

          -   further process the new request and, if no error according to list items b), c), and d) was detected, delete
              the existing TFT. After successful deletion of the TFT, the MS shall deactivate the modified PDP context
              by explicit peer-to-peer signalling between the MS and the network. The MS need not send a Modify
              PDP Context Accept message; or

          -   reject the modification request with cause "semantic error in the TFT operation".

   b) Syntactical errors in TFT operations:

      1) When the TFT operation is an operation other than "Delete existing TFT" or "No TFT operation" and the
         packet filter list in the TFT IE is empty.

      2) When the TFT operation is "Delete existing TFT" or "No TFT operation" with a non-empty packet filter list
         in the TFT IE.

      3) When the TFT operation is "Replace packet filters in existing TFT" and the packet filter to be replaced does
         not exist in the original TFT.

      4) When the TFT operation is "Delete packet filters from existing TFT" and the packet filter to be deleted does
         not exist in the original TFT.

      5) When the TFT operation is "Delete packet filters from existing TFT" with a packet filter list also including
         packet filters in addition to the packet filter identifiers.

      6) When there are other types of syntactical errors in the coding of the TFT IE, such as a mismatch between the
         number of packet filters subfield, and the number of packet filters in the packet filter list.

      7) When the TFT operation is "No TFT operation" with an empty parameters list.

      In case 3) the network shall not diagnose an error, further process the replace request and, if no error according
      to list items c) and d) was detected, include the packet filters received to the existing TFT.

      In case 4) the network shall not diagnose an error, further process the deletion request and, if no error according
      to list items c) and d) was detected, consider the respective packet filter as successfully deleted.

      Otherwise the network shall reject the modification request with cause "syntactical error in the TFT operation".

      In case 3) the MS shall not diagnose an error, further process the replace request and, if no error according to list
      items c) and d) was detected, include the packet filters received to the existing TFT.

      In case 4) the MS shall not diagnose an error, further process the deletion request and, if no error according to
      list items c) and d) was detected, consider the respective packet filter as successfully deleted.

      Otherwise the MS shall reject the modification request with cause "syntactical error in the TFT operation".

   c) Semantic errors in packet filters:

      1) When a packet filter consists of conflicting packet filter components which would render the packet filter
         ineffective, i.e. no IP packet will ever fit this packet filter. How the receiver determines a semantic error in a
         packet filter is outside the scope of the present document.

      2) When the resulting TFT, which is not assigned to the default PDP context, does not contain any packet filter
         applicable for the uplink direction.

   NOTE 3: When BCM is 'MS only', the MS is allowed to include a TFT with packet filters without any explicit
           direction information, i.e. with value "00", and such packet filters are applicable for both uplink and
           downlink directions.

      The network shall reject the modification request with cause "semantic errors in packet filter(s)".

      The MS shall reject the modification request with cause "semantic errors in packet filter(s)".

   d) Syntactical errors in packet filters:

      1) When the TFT operation is "Create a new TFT" or "Add packet filters to existing TFT" and two or more
         packet filters in the resultant TFT would have identical packet filter identifiers.

      2) When the TFT operation is "Create a new TFT" or "Add packet filters to existing TFT" or "Replace packet
         filters in existing TFT" and two or more packet filters in all TFTs associated with this PDP address and APN
         would have identical packet filter precedence values.

      3) When there are other types of syntactical errors in the coding of packet filters, such as the use of a reserved
         value for a packet filter component identifier.

      In case 1), if two or more packet filters with identical packet filter identifiers are contained in the new request,
      the network shall reject the modification request with cause "syntactical errors in packet filter(s)". Otherwise, the
      network shall not diagnose an error, further process the new request and, if it was processed successfully, delete
      the old packet filters which have the identical packet filter identifiers.

      In case 2) the network shall not diagnose an error, further process the new request and, if it was processed
      successfully, delete the old packet filters which have identical filter precedence values. Furthermore, by means
      of explicit peer-to-peer signalling between the MS and the network, the network shall deactivate the PDP
      context(s) for which it has deleted the packet filters.

      Otherwise the network shall reject the modification request with cause "syntactical errors in packet filter(s)".

      In case 1), if two or more packet filters with identical packet filter identifiers are contained in the new request,
      the MS shall reject the modification request with cause "syntactical errors in packet filter(s)". Otherwise, the MS
      shall not diagnose an error, further process the new request and, if it was processed successfully, delete the old
      packet filters which have the identical packet filter identifiers.

      In case 2) the MS shall not diagnose an error, further process the new request and, if it was processed
      successfully, delete the old packet filters which have identical filter precedence values. Furthermore, the MS
      shall deactivate the PDP context(s) for which it has deleted the packet filters by means of explicit peer-to-peer
      signalling between the MS and the network,.

      Otherwise, the MS shall reject the modification request with cause "syntactical errors in packet filter(s)".

6.1.3.4           PDP context deactivation procedure
The purpose of this procedure is to deactivate an existing PDP context between the MS and the network. The PDP
context deactivation may be initiated by the MS or by the network. The tear down indicator information element may
be included in the DEACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message in order to indicate whether only the PDP
context associated with this specific TI or all active PDP contexts sharing the same PDP address and APN as the PDP
context associated with this specific TI shall be deactivated. If the tear down is requested, all other active PDP contexts
sharing the same PDP address and APN as the PDP context associated with this specific TI shall be deactivated locally
without peer-to-peer signalling. In this case, the network should not include WLAN offload indication in the
DEACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message, and if the UE receives the WLAN offload indication, the UE
shall ignore the indication. If the tear down indicator information element is not included in the DEACTIVATE PDP
CONTEXT REQUEST message, only the PDP context associated with this specific TI shall be deactivated. For an
exception when the PDP context is a default PDP context and there are other active PDP contexts sharing the same PDP
address and APN, see subclause 6.1.3.4.3.

An MS supporting S1 mode shall always include the tear down indicator when deactivating the default PDP context. An
MS not supporting S1 mode should apply the same behavior (see 3GPP TS 23.060 [74]).

Local deactivation of a NBIFOM multi-access PDN connection can be triggered by an NBIFOM procedure
(see 3GPP TS 24.161 [158]). If such a trigger is received then the associated PDP contexts mentioned in this
specification shall be deactivated locally without peer-to-peer signalling.

After successful PDP context deactivation, the associated NSAPI and TI values are released and can be reassigned to
another PDP context.

If one or more MBMS contexts are linked to a PDP context that has been deactivated, the MS shall deactivate all those
MBMS contexts locally (without peer to peer signalling between the MS and the network).

The MS is allowed to initiate the PDP context deactivation procedure even if the timer T3396 is running.

6.1.3.4.1            PDP context deactivation initiated by the MS
In order to deactivate a PDP context, the MS sends a DEACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message to the
network, enters the state PDP-INACTIVE-PENDING and starts timer T3390. The message contains the transaction
identifier (TI) in use for the PDP context to be deactivated and a cause code that typically indicates one of the following
causes:

   # 25: LLC or SNDCP failure (A/Gb mode only);

   # 26: insufficient resources;

   # 36: regular deactivation; or

   # 37: QoS not accepted.

The network shall reply with the DEACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT ACCEPT message. Upon receipt of the
DEACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT ACCEPT message, the MS shall stop timer T3390.



                                                           ETSI
3GPP TS 24.008 version 15.8.0 Release 15                   357                        ETSI TS 124 008 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


In A/Gb mode, both the MS and the network shall initiate local release of the logical link if it is not used by another
PDP context.

In Iu mode, the network shall initiate the release of Radio Access Bearer associated with this PDP context.

If the selected Bearer Control Mode is 'MS/NW' the MS should not deactivate a PDP context, if it is the only PDP
context without TFT within a group of active PDP contexts sharing the same PDP address and APN.

   NOTE 1: A configuration with more than one PDP context without TFT within a group of active PDP contexts
           sharing the same PDP address and APN can occur during a network initiated PDP context modification
           due to asynchronous TFT states in the MS and in the network (see e.g. subclause 6.1.3.3.4 bullet a.3 in
           the description of the TFT checks).

   NOTE 2: If the MS deactivates the last remaining PDP context without TFT within a group of active PDP contexts
           sharing the same PDP address and APN, a network implementing this version of the protocol will
           deactivate all other active PDP contexts sharing the same PDP address and APN by explicit peer-to-peer
           signalling; a network compliant with earlier versions of the protocol can initiate the re-establishment of
           this PDP context using the network requested secondary PDP context activation procedure.



6.1.3.4.2            PDP context deactivation initiated by the network
In order to deactivate a PDP context, the network sends a DEACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message to the
MS and starts timer T3395. The message contains the transaction identifier in use for the PDP context to be deactivated
and a cause code that typically indicates one of the following causes:

   # 8:   Operator Determined Barring;

   # 25: LLC or SNDCP failure (A/Gb mode only);

   # 26: insufficient resources;

   # 36: regular deactivation;

   # 38: network failure;

   # 39: reactivation requested.

   #112: APN restriction value incompatible with active PDP context; or

   #113: Multiple accesses to a PDN connection not allowed.

The MS shall, upon receipt of this message, reply with a DEACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT ACCEPT message. Upon
receipt of the DEACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT ACCEPT message, the network shall stop the timer T3395.

If the DEACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message includes the cause #39 "reactivation requested", the PDP
context was activated by the MS, and the MS sent an APN for the establishment of the PDN connection, the MS shall
stop timer T3396 if it is running for the APN sent by the MS. The MS should then re-activate the PDP context. If the
MS did not send an APN for the establishment of the PDN connection and the request type was different from
"emergency", the MS shall stop the timer T3396 associated with no APN if it is running, and should re-activate the PDP
context without including an APN. Additionally, the MS should re-activate the PDP contexts that were originally
activated by the MS and released by the network as a result of this PDP context deactivation procedure. If the
DEACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message was received for an emergency PDN connection, the MS shall
not stop the timer T3396 associated with no APN if it is running. The MS should then re-initiate the PDP context
activation procedure for the emergency PDN connection.

   NOTE:      User interaction is necessary in some cases when the MS cannot re-activate the PDP context(s)
              automatically.

If a detach is requested by the HLR for an MS that has PDP contexts for emergency services, the SGSN shall send a
DEACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message to the MS for all the PDP contexts that are not PDP contexts for
emergency services.

If the network operates in network operation mode I, ISR is activated and the MS has indicated support of EMM
combined procedures in MS network capability, when the SGSN receives the request from the Serving GW for
deactivating the last remaining PDP context, then the SGSN shall perform a detach procedure for non-GPRS services
only as described in subclause 4.7.4.2.

In A/Gb mode, both the MS and the network shall initiate local release of the logical link if it is not used by another
PDP context.

In Iu mode, the network shall initiate the release of Radio Access Bearer associated with this PDP context.

If the SM cause value is #26 "insufficient resources", the network may include a value for timer T3396 in the
DEACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message.

If the SM cause value is #26 "insufficient resources" and T3396 value IE is included:

   -   the MS shall take different actions depending on the timer value received for timer T3396 (if the MS is
       configured for dual priority, exceptions are specified in subclause 6.1.3.12; if the MS is an MS configured to use
       AC11 – 15 in selected PLMN, exceptions are specified in subclause 6.1.3.11):

       i) if the timer value indicates neither zero nor deactivated, the MS shall stop the timer T3396 associated with
          the corresponding APN, if it is running. The MS shall start timer T3396 with received value and not send
          another ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST, ACTIVATE SECONDARY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST
          or MODIFY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message with exception of those identified in subclause 6.1.3.3, for
          the same APN until timer T3396 expires or the timer T3396 is stopped. If the MS did not send an APN for
          the establishment of the PDN connection and the request type was different from "emergency", the MS shall
          stop timer T3396 associated with no APN, if it is running. The MS shall then start timer T3396 with the value
          provided in the Back-off timer value IE and not send another ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST
          without an APN and with request type different from "emergency", or another ACTIVATE SECONDARY
          PDP CONTEXT REQUEST or MODIFY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message with exception of those
          identified in subclause 6.1.3.3, for a non-emergency PDN connection established without an APN sent by the
          MS, until timer T3396 expires or timer T3396 is stopped. The MS shall not stop timer T3396 upon a PLMN
          change or inter-system change;

       ii) if the timer value indicates that this timer is deactivated, the MS shall not send another ACTIVATE PDP
           CONTEXT REQUEST, ACTIVATE SECONDARY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST or MODIFY PDP
           CONTEXT REQUEST message with exception of those identified in subclause 6.1.3.3, for the same APN
           until the MS is switched off or the SIM/USIM is removed or the MS receives a REQUEST PDP CONTEXT
           ACTIVATION, REQUEST SECONDARY PDP CONTEXT ACTIVATION or MODIFY PDP CONTEXT
           REQUEST message with exception of those identified in subclause 6.1.3.3, for the same APN from the
           network or a DEACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message including SM cause #39 "reactivation
           requested" for a PDP context which was activated by the MS for the same APN from the network. If the MS
           did not send an APN for the establishment of the PDN connection and the request type was different from
           "emergency", the MS shall not send another ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST without an APN and
           with request type different from "emergency", or another ACTIVATE SECONDARY PDP CONTEXT
           REQUEST or MODIFY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST with exception of those identified in subclause 6.1.3.3,
           for a non-emergency PDN connection established without an APN sent by the MS, until the MS is switched
           off or the SIM/USIM is removed or the MS receives any of the following messages: a REQUEST PDP
           CONTEXT ACTIVATION without an APN, a REQUEST SECONDARY PDP CONTEXT ACTIVATION
           or MODIFY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message for a non-emergency PDN connection established without
           an APN sent by the MS, or a DEACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message including SM cause #39
           "reactivation requested" for a PDP context which was activated by the MS for a non-emergency PDN
           connection established without APN sent by the MS. The timer T3396 remains deactivated upon a PLMN
           change or inter-system change; and

       iii) if the timer value indicates that this timer is zero, the MS:

          -   shall stop timer T3396 associated with the corresponding APN, if running, and may send another
              ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST, ACTIVATE SECONDARY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST or
              MODIFY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message for the same APN; and

          -   if the MS did not send an APN for the establishment of the PDN connection and the request type was
              different from "emergency", the MS shall stop timer T3396 associated with no APN, if running, and may

   -   If the timer T3396 is running when the MS enters state GMM-DEREGISTERED, the MS remains switched on,
       and the SIM/USIM in the MS remains the same, then timer T3396 is kept running until it expires or it is stopped.

   -   if the MS is switched off when the timer T3396 is running, the MS shall behave as follows when the MS is
       switched on and the SIM/USIM in the MS remains the same:

       -   let t1 be the time remaining for T3396 timeout at switch off and let t be the time elapsed between switch off
           and switch on. If t1 is greater than t, then the timer shall be restarted with the value t1 – t. If t1 is equal to or
           less than t, then the timer need not be restarted. If the MS is not capable of determining t, then the MS shall
           restart the timer with the value t1; and

       -   if prior to switch off, timer T3396 was running because an ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST,
           ACTIVATE SECONDARY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST or MODIFY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message
           containing the low priority indicator set to "MS is configured for NAS signalling low priority" was rejected
           with timer T3396, and if timer T3396 is restarted at switch on, then the MS configured for dual priority shall
           handle session management requests as indicated in subclause 6.1.3.12.

If the T3396 value IE is not included, the MS shall proceed with deactivation procedure and then send DEACTIVATE
PDP CONTEXT ACCEPT message.

6.1.3.4.3             Abnormal cases
The following abnormal cases can be identified:

   a) Expiry of timers

       In the mobile station:

           On the first expiry of timer T3390, the MS shall resent the message DEACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT
           REQUEST and shall reset and restart the timer T3390. This retransmission is repeated four times, i.e. on the
           fifth expiry of timer T3390, the MS shall release all resources allocated and shall erase the PDP context
           related data.

       On the network side:

           On the first expiry of timer T3395, the network shall resent the message DEACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT
           REQUEST and shall reset and restart timer T3395. This retransmission is repeated four times, i.e. on the fifth
           expiry of timer T3395, the network shall erase the PDP context related data for that MS.

   b) Collision of MS and network initiated PDP context deactivation requests

       If the MS and the network initiated PDP context deactivation requests collide, the MS and the network shall each
       reply with the messages DEACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT ACCEPT and shall stop timer T3390 and T3395,
       respectively.

   c) Network initiated PDP context deactivation request without tear down indicator information element for a
      default PDP context

           If an MS supporting S1 mode receives a DEACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message without tear
           down indicator information element, and the PDP context associated with the specific TI is a default PDP
           context, the MS shall deactivate the default PDP context as specified in subclause 6.1.3.4.2. Additionally the
           MS shall deactivate all other active PDP contexts sharing the same PDP address and APN as the default PDP
           context locally without peer-to-peer signalling.

           An MS not supporting S1 mode may apply the same behaviour.

6.1.3.5a          Notification procedure

6.1.3.5a.1           General
The network can use the notification procedure to inform the MS about events which are relevant for the upper layer
which is using a PDP context or has requested a session management procedure.

If the MS has indicated that it supports the notification procedure, the network may initiate the procedure at any time
while a PDP context is activated or another session management procedure is ongoing.

6.1.3.5a.2           Notification procedure initiation by the network
The network initiates the notification procedure by sending a NOTIFICATION message to the MS (see example in
figure 6.9a/3GPP TS 24.008).

6.1.3.5a.3             Notification procedure in the MS
When the MS receives a NOTIFICATION message, the SM protocol entity in the MS shall provide the notification
indicator to the upper layer.

The notification indicator can have the following value:

   #1:      SRVCC handover cancelled, IMS session re-establishment required.

6.1.3.6            Receiving a SM STATUS message by a SM entity
If the SM entity of the MS receives an SM STATUS message the MS shall take different actions depending on the
received SM cause value:

   #81      Invalid transaction identifier value

         The MS shall abort any ongoing SM procedure related to the received transaction identifier value, stop any
         related timer, and deactivate the corresponding PDP or MBMS context locally (without peer to peer signalling
         between the MS and the network).

         If one or more MBMS contexts are linked to a PDP context that has been deactivated, the MS shall deactivate all
         those MBMS Contexts locally (without peer to peer signalling between the MS and the network).

   #97      Message type non-existent or not implemented

         The MS shall abort any ongoing SM procedure related to the received transaction identifier value and stop any
         related timer.

If the SM entity of the MS receives a SM STATUS message with any other SM cause value no state transition and no
specific action shall be taken as seen from the radio interface, i.e. local actions are possible.

If the SM entity of the network receives an SM STATUS message the network shall take different actions depending on
the received SM cause value:

   #81      Invalid transaction identifier value

         The network shall abort any ongoing SM procedure related to the received transaction identifier value, stop any
         related timer, and deactivate the corresponding PDP or MBMS context locally (without peer to peer signalling
         between the MS and the network).

       If one or more MBMS contexts are linked to a PDP context that has been deactivated, the MS shall deactivate all
       those MBMS Contexts locally (without peer to peer signalling between the MS and the network).

   #97    Message type non-existent or not implemented

       The network shall abort any ongoing SM procedure related to the received transaction identifier value and stop
       any related timer.

The actions to be taken in the network on receiving a SM STATUS message with any other SM cause value are an
implementation dependent option.

6.1.3.7           Protocol configuration options
The MS and the GGSN may communicate parameters by means of the protocol configuration options information
element or extended protocol configuration options information element when activating, modifying or deactivating a
PDP context. Such parameters can e.g. be used to convey information from external protocols between the MS and the
GGSN. An overview of how the protocol configuration options information element is used is specified in 3GPP TS
27.060 [36a].

The protocol configuration options information element and the extended protocol configuration options information
element is transparent to the SGSN.

   NOTE 1: The MS and the network negotiate support of the extended protocol configuration options IE end-to-end
           for each PDN connection, as the information element can only be used if it is supported also by the
           GGSN/PDN GW.

If supported by the network and the MS end-to-end for a PDN connection, protocol configuration options shall be
exchanged via the extended protocol configuration options IE. Otherwise the protocol configuration options IE is used.

For the MS, the extended protocol configuration options is supported by the network and the MS end-to-end for a PDN
connection if the network has indicated support of the extended protocol configuration options IE in the last ATTACH
ACCEPT or ROUTING AREA UPDATING ACCEPT message, and

   -   the PDP Type requested for the default PDP context is non-IP; or

   -   the network has included the extended protocol configuration options IE in at least one session management
       message received by the MS for this PDN connection.

For the SGSN, the extended protocol configuration options is supported by the network and the MS end-to-end for a
PDN connection if the MS has indicated support of the extended protocol configuration options IE in the last ATTACH
REQUEST or ROUTING AREA UPDATING REQUEST message, and

   -   the PDP Type requested for the default PDP context is non-IP; or

   -   the SGSN has received the extended protocol configuration options IE in at least one message sent by the GGSN
       or PDN GW towards the MS for this PDN connection (for details see 3GPP TS 29.274 [16D]).

   NOTE 2: For the GGSN or PDN GW, the extended protocol configuration options is supported by the network and
           the MS end-to-end for a PDN connection if:

              -   the GGSN initiates a network requested PDP context activation with offered PDP Type non-IP; or

              -   the last support indication received from the SGSN or S-GW indicates that extended protocol
                  configuration options is supported for this PDN connection (for details see 3GPP TS 29.274 [16D]).

6.1.3.8           MBMS context activation
The purpose of this procedure is to establish an MBMS context in the MS and in the network for a specific IP Multicast
Address using a specific NSAPI for MBMS user plane transmission. The MS shall only initiate the MBMS context
activation when requested by the network. However, the trigger for the activation request by the network is initiated by
the MS at the application layer (see 3GPP TS 23.246 [106]).

6.1.3.8.1            Successful MBMS context activation
In order to request an MBMS context activation, the network sends a REQUEST MBMS CONTEXT ACTIVATION
message to the MS, enters the state MBMS-ACTIVE-PENDING and starts timer T3385. The message shall contain the
IP multicast address, the APN and the Linked NSAPI.

Upon receipt of a REQUEST MBMS CONTEXT ACTIVATION message, the MS shall validate the message by
verifying the NSAPI given in the Linked NSAPI IE to be one of the active PDP context(s), stop the timer T3396 if it is
running for the APN indicated in the message and send an ACTIVATE MBMS CONTEXT REQUEST, enter state
MBMS-ACTIVE-PENDING and start timer T3380. The message shall contain an IP multicast address and an APN,
which shall be the same as the IP multicast address and the APN requested by the network in the REQUEST MBMS
CONTEXT ACTIVATION message. Furthermore, the MS shall include the Supported MBMS bearer capabilities, i.e.
the maximum downlink bit rate the MS can handle.

Upon receipt of the ACTIVATE MBMS CONTEXT REQUEST message, the network shall stop timer T3385. If the
network accepts the request, it shall reply with an ACTIVATE MBMS CONTEXT ACCEPT message.

Upon receipt of the message ACTIVATE MBMS CONTEXT ACCEPT the MS shall stop timer T3380 and shall enter
the state MBMS-ACTIVE.

6.1.3.8.2            Unsuccessful MBMS context activation requested by the MS

6.1.3.8.2.1             General

Upon receipt of an ACTIVATE MBMS CONTEXT REQUEST message the network may reject the MS initiated
MBMS context activation by sending an ACTIVATE MBMS CONTEXT REJECT message to the MS. The sender of
the message shall include the same TI as included in the ACTIVATE MBMS CONTEX REQUEST and an additional
cause code that typically indicates one of the following causes:

   # 8:   Operator Determined Barring;

   # 24: MBMS bearer capabilities insufficient for the service;

   # 26: insufficient resources;

   # 27: missing or unknown APN;

   # 29: user authentication failed;

   # 30: activation rejected by GGSN, Serving GW or PDN GW;

   # 31: activation rejected, unspecified;

   # 32: service option not supported;

   # 33: requested service option not subscribed;

   # 34: service option temporarily out of order; or

   # 95 - # 111: protocol errors.

The network may include a Back-off timer value IE in the ACTIVATE MBMS CONTEXT REJECT message.

If the Back-off timer value IE is included and the SM cause value is different from #26 "insufficient resources", the
network may include the Re-attempt indicator IE to indicate whether the MS is allowed to attempt an MBMS context
activation procedure in an equivalent PLMN.

Upon receipt of an ACTIVATE MBMS CONTEXT REJECT message, the MS shall stop timer T3380 and enter/remain
in state PDP-INACTIVE.

6.1.3.8.2.2             Handling of network rejection due to SM cause #26

If the SM cause value is #26 "insufficient resources" and the Back-off timer value IE is included, the MS shall ignore
the Re-attempt indicator IE provided by the network, if any, and take different actions depending on the timer value

received for timer T3396 in the Back-off timer value IE (if the MS is configured for dual priority, exceptions are
specified in subclause 6.1.3.12):

   i) if the timer value indicates neither zero nor deactivated, the MS shall stop timer T3396 associated with the
      corresponding APN, if it is running. The MS shall then start timer T3396 with the value provided in the Back-off
      timer value IE and shall not send another ACTIVATE MBMS CONTEXT REQUEST message for the same
      APN that was sent by the MS until timer T3396 expires or timer T3396 is stopped. The MS shall not stop timer
      T3396 upon a PLMN change or inter-system change;

   ii) if the timer value indicates that this timer is deactivated, the MS shall not send another ACTIVATE MBMS
       CONTEXT REQUEST message for the same APN that was sent by the MS, until the MS is switched off or the
       SIM/USIM is removed or the MS receives REQUEST MBMS CONTEXT ACTIVATION message for the same
       APN from the network. The timer T3396 remains deactivated upon a PLMN change or inter-system change; and

   iii) if the timer value indicates that this timer is zero, the MS may send another ACTIVATE MBMS CONTEXT
        REQUEST message for the same APN.

If the Back-off timer value IE is not included, then the MS may send another ACTIVATE MBMS CONTEXT
REQUEST message for the same APN.

If the MS is switched off when the timer T3396 is running, the MS shall behave as follows when the MS is switched on
and the SIM/USIM in the MS remains the same:

   -   let t1 be the time remaining for T3396 timeout at switch off and let t be the time elapsed between switch off and
       switch on. If t1 is greater than t, then the timer shall be restarted with the value t1 – t. If t1 is equal to or less than
       t, then the timer need not be restarted. If the MS is not capable of determining t, then the MS shall restart the
       timer with the value t1; and

   -   if prior to switch off, timer T3396 was running because an ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST,
       ACTIVATE SECONDARY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST, MODIFY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST or
       ACTIVATE MBMS CONTEXT REQUEST message containing the low priority indicator set to "MS is
       configured for NAS signalling low priority" was rejected with timer T3396, and if timer T3396 is restarted at
       switch on, then the MS configured for dual priority shall handle session management requests as indicated in
       subclause 6.1.3.12.

6.1.3.8.2.3               Handling of network rejection due to SM cause other than SM cause #26

If the SM cause value is different from #26 "insufficient resources", and the Back-off timer value IE is included, the MS
shall take different actions depending on the timer value received in the Back-off timer value IE:

   i) if the timer value indicates neither zero nor deactivated, the MS shall start the back-off timer with the value
      provided in the Back-off timer value IE for the MBMS context activation procedure and PLMN and APN
      combination. The MS shall not send another ACTIVATE MBMS CONTEXT REQUEST message in the PLMN
      for the same APN that was sent by the MS until the back-off timer expires, the MS is switched off or the
      SIM/USIM is removed;

   ii) if the timer value indicates that this timer is deactivated, the MS shall not send another ACTIVATE MBMS
       CONTEXT REQUEST message in the PLMN for the same APN that was sent by the MS until the MS is
       switched off or the SIM/USIM is removed; and

   iii) if the timer value indicates that this timer is zero, the MS may send an ACTIVATE MBMS CONTEXT
        REQUEST message in the PLMN for the same APN.

If the Back-off timer value IE is not included, then the MS shall ignore the Re-attempt indicator IE provided by the
network, if any.

   i) Additionally, if the SM cause value is #8 "operator determined barring", #27 "missing or unknown APN", #32
      "service option not supported", or #33 "requested service option not subscribed", the MS shall proceed as
      follows:

       -   if the MS is registered in its HPLMN or in a PLMN that is within the EHPLMN list, the MS shall behave as
           described above in the present subclause, using the configured SM_RetryWaitTime value as specified in
           3GPP TS 24.368 [135] or in USIM file NASCONFIG as specified in 3GPP TS 31.102 [112], if available, as
           back-off timer value; and

3GPP TS 24.008 version 15.8.0 Release 15                  365                       ETSI TS 124 008 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


       -   otherwise, if the MS is not registered in its HPLMN or in a PLMN that is within the EHPLMN list, or if the
           SM_RetryWaitTime value is not configured, the MS shall behave as described above in the present subclause
           using the default value of 12 minutes for the back-off timer.

   ii) For SM cause values different from #8 "operator determined barring", #27 "missing or unknown APN", #32
       "service option not supported", or #33 "requested service option not subscribed", the MS behaviour regarding the
       start of a back-off timer is unspecified.

The MS shall not stop any back-off timer upon a PLMN change or inter-system change. If the network indicates that a
back-off timer for the MBMS context activation procedure and PLMN and APN combination is deactivated, then it
remains deactivated upon a PLMN change or inter-system change.

   NOTE 1: This means the back-off timer can still be running or be deactivated for the given SM procedure and
           PLMN and APN combination when the MS returns to the PLMN or when it performs inter-system
           change back from S1 mode to A/Gb or Iu mode. Thus the MS can still be prevented from sending another
           ACTIVATE MBMS CONTEXT REQUEST message in the PLMN for the same APN.

If the back-off timer is started upon receipt of an ACTIVATE MBMS CONTEXT REJECT message (i.e. the timer
value was provided by the network, a configured value is available or the default value is used as explained above) or
the back-off timer is deactivated, the MS behaves as follows:

   i) after a PLMN change the MS may send an ACTIVATE MBMS CONTEXT REQUEST message for the same
      APN in the new PLMN, if the back-off timer is not running and is not deactivated for the MBMS context
      activation procedure and the combination of new PLMN and APN;

       Furthermore as an implementation option, for the SM cause values #8 "operator determined barring", #27
       "missing or unknown APN", #32 "service option not supported" or #33 "requested service option not
       subscribed", if the network does not include a Re-attempt indicator IE, the MS may decide not to automatically
       send another ACTIVATE MBMS CONTEXT REQUEST message for the same APN, if the MS registered to a
       new PLMN which is in the list of equivalent PLMNs.

   ii) if the network includes the Re-attempt indicator IE, the MS shall ignore any indication provided in the IE
       regarding whether re-attempt in S1 mode is allowed. If the Re-attempt indicator IE indicates that re-attempt in an
       equivalent PLMN is not allowed, then depending on the timer value received in the Back-off timer value IE, for
       each combination of a PLMN from the equivalent PLMN list and the APN the MS shall start a back-off timer for
       the MBMS context activation procedure with the value provided by the network, or deactivate the respective
       back-off timer.

   NOTE 2: The back-off timer is used to describe a logical model of the required MS behaviour. This model does not
           imply any specific implementation, e.g. as a timer or timestamp.

   NOTE 3: Reference to back-off timer in this section can either refer to use of timer T3396 or to use of a different
           packet system specific timer within the MS. Whether the MS uses T3396 as a back-off timer or it uses
           different packet system specific timers as back-off timers is left up to MS implementation. This back-off
           timer is stopped when the MS is switched off or the SIM/USIM is removed.

6.1.3.8.3            Unsuccessful MBMS context activation requested by the network
Upon receipt of the REQUEST MBMS CONTEXT ACTIVATION message, the MS may reject the network requested
MBMS context activation by sending the REQUEST MBMS CONTEXT ACTIVATION REJECT message to the
network. The sender of the message shall include the same TI as included in the REQUEST MBMS CONTEXT
ACTIVATION and an additional cause code that typically indicates one of the following causes:

   # 26: insufficient resources;

   # 31: activation rejected, unspecified;

   # 40: feature not supported; or

   # 95 - # 111: protocol errors.

The network shall stop timer T3385 and enter in state PDP-INACTIVE.

6.1.3.8.4            Abnormal cases
The following abnormal cases can be identified:

   a) Expiry of timers in the mobile station: On the first expiry of the timer T3380, the MS shall resend the
      ACTIVATE MBMS CONTEXT REQUEST and shall reset and restart timer T3380. This retransmission is
      repeated four times, i.e. on the fifth expiry of timer T3380, the MS shall release all resources possibly allocated
      for this invocation and shall abort the procedure; no automatic MBMS context activation re-attempt shall be
      performed.

   b) Expiry of timers on the network side: On the first expiry of the timer T3385, the network shall resend the
      message REQUEST MBMS CONTEXT ACTIVATION and shall reset and restart timer T3385. This
      retransmission is repeated four times, i.e. on the fifth expiry of timer T3385, the network shall release possibly
      allocated resources for this activation and shall abort the procedure.

   c) MBMS context activation request for an already activated MBMS context (on the mobile station side): If the MS
      receives a REQUEST MBMS CONTEXT ACTIVATION message with the same combination of APN and IP
      multicast address (i.e. PDP type and PDP address) as an already activated MBMS context, the MS shall
      deactivate the existing MBMS context locally without notification to the network and proceed with the requested

   d) MBMS context activation request for an already activated MBMS context (on the network side): If the network
      receives an ACTIVATE MBMS CONTEXT REQUEST message with the same combination of APN and IP
      multicast address (i.e. PDP type and PDP address) as an already activated MBMS context, the network shall

6.1.3.9          MBMS context deactivation
The purpose of this procedure is to deactivate an existing MBMS context in the MS and the network. The MS shall only
initiate the MBMS context deactivation when requested by the network, however the trigger for the deactivation request
by the network may be initiated by the MS at application layer or by the network, see 3GPP TS 23.246 [106].

After a successful MBMS context deactivation, the associated MBMS NSAPI and TI values shall be released in both
the MS and the network and can be reassigned to another MBMS context.

The MBMS context deactivation procedure makes use of the messaging and signalling of the PDP context deactivation
procedure as described in the subclauses 6.1.3.9.1 and 6.1.3.9.2.

6.1.3.9.1            MBMS context deactivation initiated by the network
In order to request an MBMS context deactivation, the network sends a DEACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST
message to the MS, enters the state MBMS-INACTIVE-PENDING and starts timer T3395. The message contains the
transaction identifier (TI) in use for the MBMS context to be deactivated and a cause code that typically indicates one
of the following causes:

   # 36: regular deactivation;

   # 38: network failure;

   # 47: multicast group membership time-out.

The MS shall reply with a DEACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT ACCEPT message and enter the state PDP-INACTIVE.
Upon receipt of the DEACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT ACCEPT message, the network shall stop the timer T3395 and
enter the state PDP-INACTIVE.

6.1.3.9.2            Abnormal cases
The following abnormal cases can be identified:

   a) Expiry of timers:

          On the first expiry of the timer T3395, the network shall resend the message DEACTIVATE PDP
          CONTEXT REQUEST and shall reset and restart the timer T3395. This retransmission is repeated, i.e. on the
          fifth expiry of the timer T3395, the network shall erase the MBMS context related data for that MS.


                              MS                                                    Network

6.1.3.10         MBMS protocol configuration options
The MS and the GGSN may communicate parameters related to the MBMS bearer by means of the MBMS protocol
configuration options information element when activating or deactivating an MBMS context. For example, such
parameters can be used to convey information between the MS and the GGSN.

The MBMS protocol configuration options information element is transparent to the SGSN.

6.1.3.11         Handling of APN based congestion control
The network may detect and start performing the APN based congestion control when one or more APN congestion
criteria as specified in 3GPP TS 23.060 [74] are met. The network may store an APN congestion back-off time on a per
MS and congested APN basis. If the MS does not provide an APN for the PDP context activation, then the SGSN uses
the APN which is used in GGSN/PDN GW selection procedure as congested APN. When APN based congestion
control is active, the network may reject session management requests except the modify PDP context requests from
UEs or deactivate existing PDP contexts with SM cause value #26 "insufficient resources".

In the MS, session management timers T3396 for APN based congestion control are started and stopped on a per APN
basis. The APN associated with T3396 is the APN sent by the MS when the PDN connection is established. If no APN
is included in the ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message, then T3396 is associated with no APN. For this
purpose the MS shall memorize the APN provided to the network during the PDP context activation. The timer T3396

associated with no APN will never be started due to any SM procedure related to an emergency PDN connection. If the
timer T3396 associated with no APN is running, it does not affect the ability of the MS to request an emergency PDN
connection.

If timer T3396 is running or is deactivated, and the MS is an MS configured to use AC11 – 15 in selected PLMN, then
the MS is allowed to initiate any session management procedure for the respective APN.

6.1.3.11A        Handling of group specific session management congestion control
The network may detect and start performing the group specific session management congestion control when one or
more group congestion criteria as specified in 3GPP TS 23.060 [74] are met. When group specific session management
congestion control is active, the mechanism for APN based congestion control as specified in subclause 6.1.3.11 shall
be followed.

6.1.3.12         Handling session management request for MS configured for dual priority
If timer T3396 is running for a specific APN due to one of the following reasons:

   -   an ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST, ACTIVATE SECONDARY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST,
       MODIFY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST or ACTIVATE MBMS CONTEXT REQUEST message containing the
       low priority indicator set to "MS is configured for NAS signalling low priority" was rejected with a timer value
       for timer T3396 and SM cause value #26 "insufficient resources";

   -   a DEACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message was received with a timer value for timer T3396 and
       SM cause value #26 "insufficient resources" for a PDP context established with the low priority indicator set to
       "MS is configured for NAS signalling low priority", or

   -   because the MS received a DEACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message containing a timer value for
       timer T3396 and SM cause value #26 "insufficient resources" for a PDP context established with the low priority
       indicator set to "MS is configured for NAS signalling low priority";

upon request of the upper layers the MS can:

   -   send an ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST or ACTIVATE MBMS CONTEXT REQUEST message to
       the same APN, with low priority indicator set to "MS is not configured for NAS signalling low priority"; or,

   -   send an ACTIVATE SECONDARY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST or MODIFY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST
       message, with low priority indicator set to "MS is not configured for NAS signalling low priority", for an active
       PDP context established with low priority indicator set to "MS is not configured for NAS signalling low priority"
       exists.

If timer T3396 is running, because any of the following messages containing the low priority indicator set to "MS is
configured for NAS signalling low priority" was rejected with a timer value for timer T3396 and SM cause value #26
"insufficient resources":

   -   an ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST without an APN and with request type different from "emergency";
       or

   -   an ACTIVATE SECONDARY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST or MODIFY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message
       for a non-emergency PDN connection established without APN sent by the MS,

or because the MS received a DEACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message containing a timer value for timer
T3396 and SM cause value #26 "insufficient resources" for a non-emergency PDN connection established without an
APN and established with the low priority indicator set to "MS is configured for NAS signalling low priority", then
upon request of the upper layers the MS can:

   -   send an ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message without an APN and with low priority indicator set to
       "MS is not configured for NAS signalling low priority" for establishment an non-emergency PDN connection; or

   -   send an ACTIVATE SECONDARY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST or MODIFY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST
       message, with low priority indicator set to "MS is not configured for NAS signalling low priority", for an active
       non-emergency PDP context established without an APN and with low priority indicator set to "MS is not
       configured for NAS signalling low priority".

3GPP TS 24.008 version 15.8.0 Release 15                  369                       ETSI TS 124 008 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


For requests with low priority indicator set to "MS is configured for NAS signalling low priority", the MS shall follow
the procedures specified in subclause 6.1.3.1.3.

6.1.3.13         Handling of network rejection not due to APN based congestion control
The network may include a back-off timer value in a session management reject message to regulate the time interval at
which the MS may retry the same procedure. For SM cause values other than #26 "insufficient resources", the network
may also include the re-attempt indicator to indicate whether the MS is allowed to re-attempt the corresponding EPS
session management procedure for the same APN in S1 mode after inter-system change.

   NOTE 1: If the network includes this back-off timer value, then the MS is blocked from sending another SM
           request for the same procedure for the same PLMN and APN combination for the specified duration.
           Therefore, the operator needs to exercise caution in determining the use of this timer value.

   NOTE 2: If the re-attempt indicator is not provided by the network, an MS registered in its HPLMN or in an
           EHPLMN can use the configured SM_RetryAtRATChange value specified in the NAS configuration MO
           or in the USIM NASCONFIG file to derive the re-attempt indicator as specified in subclauses 6.1.3.1.3.3,
           6.1.3.2.2.3, and 6.1.3.3.3.3.

If re-attempt in S1 mode is allowed, the MS shall consider the back-off timer to be applicable only to the GPRS session
management in A/Gb and Iu mode for the rejected session management procedure and the given PLMN and APN
combination. If re-attempt in S1 mode is not allowed, the MS shall consider the back-off timer to be applicable to both
NAS protocols, i.e. applicable to the GPRS session management in A/Gb and Iu mode for the rejected session
management procedure and to the EPS session management in S1 mode for the corresponding EPS session management
procedure and the given PLMN and APN combination.

The APN of the PLMN and APN combination associated with the back-off timer is the APN sent by the MS when the
PDN connection is established. If no APN is included in the ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message, then
the back-off timer is associated with the combination of the PLMN and no APN. For this purpose the MS shall
memorize the APN provided to the network during the PDP context activation. The back-off timer associated with the
combination of a PLMN with no APN will never be started due to any SM procedure related to an emergency PDN
connection. If the back-off timer associated with the combination of a PLMN with no APN is running, it does not affect
the ability of the MS to request an emergency PDN connection.

The network may additionally indicate in the re-attempt indicator that a command to back-off is applicable not only for
the PLMN in which the MS received the session management reject message, but for each PLMN included in the
equivalent PLMN list at the time when the session management reject message was received.

If the back-off timer is running or is deactivated for a given PLMN and APN combination, and the MS is an MS
configured to use AC11 – 15 in selected PLMN, then the MS is allowed to initiate any GPRS session management
procedure for this PLMN and APN combination.

6.1.3.14         Handling of WLAN offload control
In networks that support offloading of traffic to WLAN, as specified in 3GPP TS 25.331 [23c], a permission to offload
is determined for the MS and the PDP context in accordance with 3GPP TS 23.060 [74] subclause 5.3.21.


6.2           void

6.3           Coordination between SM and GMM for supporting ISR
The MS with its TIN set as "RAT-related TMSI" for which ISR is activated shall change its TIN to "P-TMSI" to locally
deactivate ISR and stop the periodic tracking area update timer T3412 or T3423, if running:

   -   upon modification of any PDP context which was activated before the ISR is activated in the MS;

   -   upon deactivation of the last remaining PDP context in the MS;

   -   at the time when the MS performs intersystem change from A/Gb mode to S1 mode or from Iu mode to S1 mode
       if any PDP context activated after the ISR was activated in the MS exists, and the MS is in EMM-IDLE mode on
       completion of intersystem change; or

    -   upon deactivation of last non-emergency PDP context in the MS, if the MS has only a PDN connection for
        emergency bearer services remaining.

ISR remains activated on the network side in the above cases.


6.4           MSISDN notification procedure
The MSISDN notification procedure allows the MS to query the network for its MSISDN for the purpose of user
information. In order to request the MSISDN, the MS shall encode the protocol configuration options information
element (subclause 10.5.6.3) in the MS to network direction to indicate MSISDN query. The network shall then provide
the MSISDN, if available, in the protocol configuration options information element in the network to MS direction.
Querying the network and handling of the provided MSISDN by the MS is implementation dependent, in a similar way
to the USSD notification or application mode defined in 3GPP TS 23.090 [132].

    NOTE:      The MS might store the provided MSISDN in the corresponding USIM file (see 3GPP TS 31.102 [112]
               subclause 4.2.26) and such an MS could check this USIM file to determine whether to query the network.

The network shall provide only one MSISDN. As a result, a provided MSISDN shall supercede any MSISDN that was
previously provided in the protocol configuration options information element. The MSISDN provided is for user
information only, and the MS shall not use the MSISDN in any NAS signalling procedure. If the MSISDN is stored in
the ME, the ME shall retain the MSISDN at power off. The MSISDN stored in the ME, if any, can only be used if the
IMSI from the USIM matches the IMSI stored in non-volatile memory, else the MS shall delete the MSISDN.

See 3GPP TS 23.108 [9a].



8             Handling of unknown, unforeseen, and erroneous
              protocol data

8.1           General
The procedures specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 and call-related supplementary service handling in 3GPP TS 24.010 [21]
apply to those messages which pass the checks described in this subclause.

This subclause also specifies procedures for the handling of unknown, unforeseen, and erroneous protocol data by the
receiving entity. These procedures are called "error handling procedures", but in addition to providing recovery
mechanisms for error situations they define a compatibility mechanism for future extensions of the protocols.

Error handling concerning the value part of the Facility IE and of the SS Version Indicator IE are not in the scope of the
present document. It is defined in 3GPP TS 24.010 [21] and the 3GPP TS 24.08x series.

Sub subclauses 8.1 to 8.8 shall be applied in order of precedence.

Most error handling procedures are mandatory for the mobile station.

Detailed error handling procedures in the network are implementation dependent and may vary from PLMN to PLMN.
However, when extensions of this protocol are developed, networks will be assumed to have the error handling that is
indicated in this subclause as mandatory ("shall") and that is indicated as strongly recommended ("should").
Subclauses 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5 and 8.7.2 do not apply to the error handling in the network applied to the receipt of initial
layer 3 message: If the network diagnoses an error described in one of these subclauses in the initial layer 3 message
received from the mobile station, it shall either:

    -   try to recognize the classmark and then take further implementation dependent actions; or

    -   release the RR-connection.

Also, the error handling of the network is only considered as mandatory or strongly recommended when certain
thresholds for errors are not reached during a dedicated connection.

For definition of semantical and syntactical errors see 3GPP TS 24.007 [20], subclause 11.4.2.


8.2           Message too short
When a message is received that is too short to contain a complete message type information element, that message
shall be ignored, cf. 3GPP TS 24.007 [20].


8.3           Unknown or unforeseen transaction identifier
8.3.1         Call Control
The mobile station and the network shall ignore a Call Control message received with TI EXT bit = 0. Otherwise, if the
TI EXT bit =1 or no extension is used, the behaviour described below shall be followed.

The mobile station and network shall reject a SETUP, EMERGENCY SETUP or START CC message received with
octet 1 part of the TI value coded as "111" by sending RELEASE COMPLETE with cause #81 "Invalid transaction
identifier value" The TI value in RELEASE COMPLETE shall be the complete TI value including the extension octet
from the message that caused the rejection.

Any message other than SETUP, EMERGENCY SETUP or START CC received with octet 1 part of the TI value
coded as "111" shall be ignored.

For a call control message received with octet 1 part of the TI value not coded as "111", the following procedures shall
apply:

   a) For a network that does not support the "Network initiated MO call" option and for all mobile stations:

       Whenever any call control message except EMERGENCY SETUP, SETUP or RELEASE COMPLETE is
       received specifying a transaction identifier which is not recognized as relating to an active call or to a call in
       progress, the receiving entity shall send a RELEASE COMPLETE message with cause #81 "invalid transaction
       identifier value" using the received transaction identifier value and remain in the Null state.

       For a network that does support the "Network initiated MO call" option $(CCBS)$:

       Whenever any call control message except EMERGENCY SETUP, SETUP, START CC or RELEASE
       COMPLETE is received specifying a transaction identifier which is not recognized as relating to an active call or
       to a call in progress, the receiving entity shall send a RELEASE COMPLETE message with cause #81 "invalid
       transaction identifier value" using the received transaction identifier value and remain in the Null state.

   b) When a RELEASE COMPLETE message is received specifying a transaction identifier which is not recognized
      as relating to an active call or to a call in progress, the MM connection associated with that transaction identifier
      shall be released.

   c) For a network that does not support the "Network initiated MO call" option and for all mobile stations:

       When an EMERGENCY SETUP or, a SETUP message is received specifying a transaction identifier which is
       not recognized as relating to an active call or to a call in progress, and with a transaction identifier flag
       incorrectly set to "1", this message shall be ignored.

       For a network that does support the "Network initiated MO call" option $(CCBS)$:

       When an EMERGENCY SETUP, a START CC or, a SETUP message is received specifying a transaction
       identifier which is not recognised as relating to an active call or to a call in progress, and with a transaction
       identifier flag incorrectly set to "1", this message shall be ignored.

   d) When a SETUP message is received by the mobile station specifying a transaction identifier which is recognized
      as relating to an active call or to a call in progress, this SETUP message shall be ignored.

   e) For a network that does not support the "Network initiated MO call" option:

      When an EMERGENCY SETUP message or a SETUP message is received by the network specifying a
      transaction identifier which is recognized as relating to an active call or to a call in progress, this message need
      not be treated and the network may perform other actions.

      For a network that does support the "Network initiated MO call" option $(CCBS)$:

      When an EMERGENCY SETUP message or a START CC message is received by the network specifying a
      transaction identifier which is recognised as relating to an active call or to a call in progress, this message need
      not be treated and the network may perform other actions.

      The same applies to a SETUP message unless the transaction has been established by a START_CC message
      and the network is in the "recall present" state (N0.6).


8.3.2        Session Management
The mobile station and network shall ignore a session management message with TI EXT bit = 0. Otherwise, the
following procedures shall apply:

   a) Whenever any session management message except ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST, ACTIVATE
      SECONDARY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST, or SM-STATUS is received by the network specifying a
      transaction identifier which is not recognized as relating to an active PDP context or MBMS context,or to a PDP
      context or MBMS context that is in the process of activation or deactivation, the network shall send a SM-
      STATUS message with cause #81 "invalid transaction identifier value" using the received transaction identifier
      value including the extension octet and remain in the PDP-INACTIVE state.

   b) Whenever any session management message except REQUEST PDP CONTEXT ACTIVATION, REQUEST
      SECONDARY PDP CONTEXT ACTIVATION, REQUEST MBMS CONTEXT ACTIVATION, or SM-
      STATUS is received by the MS specifying a transaction identifier which is not recognized as relating to an
      active context or to a context that is in the process of activation or deactivation, the MS shall send a SM-
      STATUS message with cause #81 "invalid transaction identifier value" using the received transaction identifier
      value including the extension octet and remain in the PDP-INACTIVE state.

   c) When a REQUEST PDP CONTEXT ACTIVATION message, REQUEST SECONDARY PDP CONTEXT
      ACTIVATION message or REQUEST MBMS CONTEXT ACTIVATION message is received by the MS with

   d) When an ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message is received by the network specifying a transaction
      identifier which is not recognized as relating to a PDP context that is in the process of activation, and with a
      transaction identifier flag set to "1", this message shall be ignored.

   e) Whenever an ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST or ACTIVATE SECONDARY PDP CONTEXT
      REQUEST message is received by the network specifying a transaction identifier relating to a PDP context or
      MBMS context not in state PDP-INACTIVE, the network shall deactivate the old PDP context or MBMS
      context relating to the received transaction identifier without notifying the MS. Furthermore, the network shall
      continue with the activation procedure of a new PDP context as indicated in the received message. Whenever an
      ACTIVATE MBMS CONTEXT REQUEST message is received by the network specifying a transaction
      identifier relating to an MBMS context not in state PDP-INACTIVE, the network shall deactivate the old MBMS
      context relating to the received transaction identifier without notifying the MS. Furthermore, the network shall
      continue with the activation procedure of a new MBMS context as indicated in the received message.

   f) Whenever a REQUEST PDP CONTEXT ACTIVATION message or REQUEST SECONDARY PDP
      CONTEXT ACTIVATION message is received by the MS specifying a transaction identifier relating to a PDP
      context or MBMS context not in state PDP-INACTIVE, the MS shall locally deactivate the old PDP context or
      MBMS context relating to the received transaction identifier. Furthermore, the MS shall continue with the
      activation procedure of a new PDP context as indicated in the received message.

      Whenever a REQUEST MBMS CONTEXT ACTIVATION message is received by the MS specifying a
      transaction identifier relating to a PDP context or MBMS context not in state PDP-INACTIVE, the MS shall
      locally deactivate the old PDP context or MBMS context relating to the received transaction identifier.
      Furthermore, the MS shall continue with the activation procedure of a new MBMS context as indicated in the
      received message.

8.4           Unknown or unforeseen message type
If a mobile station receives an RR, MM or CC message with message type not defined for the PD or not implemented
by the receiver in unacknowledged mode, it shall ignore the message.

If a mobile station receives an RR, MM or CC message with message type not defined for the PD or not implemented
by the receiver in acknowledged mode, it shall return a status message (STATUS, MM STATUS depending on the
protocol discriminator) with cause # 97 "message type non-existent or not implemented".

If a mobile station receives a GMM message or SM message with message type not defined for the PD or not
implemented by the receiver, it shall return a status message (GMM STATUS or SM STATUS depending on the
protocol discriminator) with cause # 97 "message type non-existent or not implemented".

If the network receives an MM message with message type not defined for the PD or not implemented by the receiver in
a protocol state where reception of an unsolicited message with the given PD from the mobile station is not foreseen in
the protocol, the network actions are implementation dependent. Otherwise, if the network receives a message with
message type not defined for the PD or not implemented by the receiver, it shall ignore the message except that it
should return a status message (STATUS, MM STATUS, GMM STATUS or SM STATUS depending on the protocol
discriminator) with cause #97 "message type non-existent or not implemented".

   NOTE:      A message type not defined for the PD in the given direction is regarded by the receiver as a message
              type not defined for the PD, see 3GPP TS 24.007 [20].

If the mobile station receives a message not compatible with the protocol state, the mobile station shall ignore the
message except for the fact that, if an RR connection exists, it returns a status message (STATUS, MM STATUS
depending on the protocol discriminator) with cause #98 "Message type not compatible with protocol state". When the
message was a GMM message the GMM-STATUS message with cause #98 "Message type not compatible with
protocol state" shall be returned. When the message was a SM message the SM-STATUS message with cause #98
"Message type not compatible with protocol state" shall be returned.

If the network receives a message not compatible with the protocol state, the network actions are implementation
dependent.

   NOTE:      The use by GMM and SM of unacknowledged LLC may lead to messages "not compatible with the
              protocol state".


8.5           Non-semantical mandatory information element errors
When on receipt of a message,

   -   an "imperative message part" error; or

   -   a "missing mandatory IE" error;

is diagnosed or when a message containing:

   -   a syntactically incorrect mandatory IE; or

   -   an IE unknown in the message, but encoded as "comprehension required" (see 3GPP TS 24.007 [20]); or

   -   an out of sequence IE encoded as "comprehension required" (see 3GPP TS 24.007 [20]) is received,

       the mobile station shall proceed as follows:

       If the message is not one of the messages listed in subclauses 8.5.1, 8.5.2, 8.5.3, 8.5.4 and 8.5.5 a), b) , f) or h),
       the mobile station shall ignore the message except for the fact that, if an RR connection exists, it shall return a
       status message (STATUS, MM STATUS depending on the protocol discriminator) with cause # 96 "Invalid
       mandatory information". If the message was a GMM message the GMM-STATUS message with cause #96 "

          When the message is not one of the messages listed in subclause 8.5.3 b), c), d) or e) and 8.5.5 a), c), d), e) or
          g), the network shall either:

          -   try to treat the message (the exact further actions are implementation dependent), or

          -   ignore the message except that it should return a status message (STATUS, or MM STATUS (depending
              on the protocol discriminator), GMM STATUS, or SM STATUS) with cause # 96 "Invalid mandatory

      "invalid mandatory information" and subclause 5.4. "call clearing" applies as normal.

   c) If the message is a RELEASE message, a RELEASE COMPLETE message shall be returned with cause value #
      96 "invalid mandatory information".

   d) If the message is a RELEASE COMPLETE message, it shall be treated as a normal RELEASE COMPLETE
      message.

   e) If the message is a HOLD REJECT or RETRIEVE REJECT message, it shall be treated as a normal HOLD
      REJECT or RETRIEVE REJECT message.

   f) If the message is a STATUS message and received by the network, a RELEASE COMPLETE message may be

8.6           Unknown and unforeseen IEs in the non-imperative
              message part
8.6.1         IEIs unknown in the message
The MS shall ignore all IEs unknown in a message which are not encoded as "comprehension required" (see
3GPP TS 24.007 [20]).

The network shall take the same approach.


8.6.2         Out of sequence IEs
The MS shall ignore all out of sequence IEs in a message which are not encoded as "comprehension required" (see
3GPP TS 24.007 [20]).

The network should take the same approach.


8.6.3         Repeated IEs
If an information element with format T, TV, or TLV is repeated in a message in which repetition of the information
element is not specified in clause 9 of the present document, only the contents of the information element appearing
first shall be handled and all subsequent repetitions of the information element shall be ignored. When repetition of
information elements is specified, only the contents of specified repeated information elements shall be handled. If the
limit on repetition of information elements is exceeded, the contents of information elements appearing first up to the
limit of repetitions shall be handled and all subsequent repetitions of the information element shall be ignored.

The network should follow the same procedures.


8.7           Non-imperative message part errors
This category includes:

   -   syntactically incorrect optional IEs;

   -   conditional IE errors.


8.7.1         Syntactically incorrect optional IEs
The MS shall treat all optional IEs that are syntactically incorrect in a message as not present in the message.

The network shall take the same approach.


8.7.2         Conditional IE errors
When the MS upon receipt of an RR, MM or CC message diagnoses a "missing conditional IE" error or an "unexpected
conditional IE" error or when it receives an RR, MM or CC message containing at least one syntactically incorrect
conditional IE, it shall ignore the message except for the fact that, if an RR connection exists, it shall return a status
message (STATUS, or MM STATUS depending on the PD) with cause value # 100 "conditional IE error".

When the MS upon receipt of a GMM or SM message diagnoses a "missing conditional IE" error or an "unexpected
conditional IE" error or when it receives a GMM or SM message containing at least one syntactically incorrect
conditional IE, it shall ignore the message and it shall return a status message (GMM STATUS or SM STATUS
depending on the PD) with cause value # 100 "conditional IE error".

When the network receives a message and diagnose a "missing conditional IE" error or an "unexpected conditional IE"
error or when it receives a message containing at least one syntactically incorrect conditional IE, the network shall
either

    -   try to treat the message (the exact further actions are implementation dependent), or

    -   ignore the message except that it should return a status message (STATUS, MM STATUS, GMM STATUS or
        SM STATUS depending on the protocol discriminator) with cause # 100 "conditional IE error".


8.8            Messages with semantically incorrect contents
When a message with semantically incorrect contents is received, the foreseen reactions of the procedural part of 3GPP
TS 24.008 (i.e. of clauses 3, 4, 5, 6) are performed. If however no such reactions are specified, the MS shall ignore the
message except for the fact that, if an RR connection exists, it returns a status message (STATUS, or MM STATUS
depending on the PD) with cause value # 95 "semantically incorrect message". If the message was a GMM message the
GMM-STATUS message with cause #95 "semantically incorrect message" shall be returned. If the message was an SM
message the SM-STATUS message with cause # 95 "semantically incorrect message" shall be returned.

The network should follow the same procedure except that a status message is not normally transmitted.

Semantic checking of the Facility information element value part (defined in 3GPP TS 24.080 [24]) is the subject of the
technical specifications 3GPP TS 24.010 [21] and the 3GPP TS 24.08x series.



9              Message functional definitions and contents
This clause defines the structure of the messages of those layer 3 protocols defined in 3GPP TS 24.008. These are
standard L3 messages as defined in 3GPP TS 24.007 [20].

Each definition given in the present clause includes:

    a) a brief description of the message direction and use, including whether the message has:

        1. Local significance, i.e. relevant only on the originating or terminating access;

        2. Access significance, i.e. relevant in the originating and terminating access, but not in the network;

        3. Dual significance, i.e. relevant in either the originating or terminating access and in the network; or

        4. Global significance, i.e. relevant in the originating and terminating access and in the network.

    b) a table listing the information elements known in the message and their order of their appearance in the message.
       In messages for circuit-switched call control also a shift information element shall be considered as known even
       if not included in the table. All information elements that may be repeated are explicitly indicated. (V and LV
       formatted IEs, which compose the imperative part of the message, occur before T, TV, and TLV formatted IEs
       which compose the non-imperative part of the message, cf. 3GPP TS 24.007 [20].) In a (maximal) sequence of
       consecutive information elements with half octet length, the first information element with half octet length
       occupies bits 1 to 4 of octet N, the second bits 5 to 8 of octet N, the third bits 1 to 4 of octet N+1 etc. Such a
       sequence always has an even number of elements.

        For each information element the table indicates:

        1. the information element identifier, in hexadecimal notation, if the IE has format T, TV, or TLV. Usually,
           there is a default IEI for an information element type; default IEIs of different IE types of the same protocol
           are different. If the IEI has half octet length, it is specified by a notation representing the IEI as a
           hexadecimal digit followed by a "-" (example: B-).

   NOTE 1: The same IEI may be used for different information element types in different messages of the same
           protocol.

   NOTE 2: In the CC protocol the IEI of the locking shift and non-locking shift information elements is the same in
           all messages and is not used for any other information elements.

      2. the name of the information element (which may give an idea of the semantics of the element). The name of
         the information element (usually written in italics) followed by "IE" or "information element" is used in
         3GPP TS 24.008 as reference to the information element within a message.

      3. the name of the type of the information element (which indicates the coding of the value part of the IE), and
         generally, the referenced subclause of clause 10 of 3GPP TS 24.008 describing the value part of the
         information element.

      4. the presence requirement indication (M, C, or O) for the IE as defined in 3GPP TS 24.007 [20].

      5. The format of the information element (T, V, TV, LV, TLV) as defined in 3GPP TS 24.007 [20].

      6. The length of the information element (or permissible range of lengths), in octets, in the message, where "?"
         means that the maximum length of the IE is only constrained by link layer protocol, and in the case of the
         Facility IE by possible further conditions specified in 3GPP TS 24.010 [21]. This indication is non-
         normative.

   c.) subclauses specifying, where appropriate, conditions for IEs with presence requirement C or O in the relevant
       message which together with other conditions specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 define when the information
       elements shall be included or not, what non-presence of such IEs means, and - for IEs with presence requirement
       C - the static conditions for presence and/or non-presence of the IEs (see 3GPP TS 24.007 [20]).

9.3.2.1            Repeat indicator
The repeat indicator information element shall be included if bearer capability 1 information element and bearer
capability 2 IE are both included in the message.

9.3.2.2            Bearer capability 1 and bearer capability 2
The bearer capability 1 information element shall be included if and only if at least one of the following six cases
holds:

     -   the mobile station wishes another bearer capability than that given by the bearer capability 1 information
         element of the incoming SETUP message;

     -   the bearer capability 1 information element is missing or not fully specified in the SETUP message;

     -   the bearer capability 1 information element received in the SETUP message is accepted and the "radio channel
         requirement" of the mobile station is other than "full rate support only mobile station";

     -   the bearer capability 1 information element received in the SETUP message indicates speech and is accepted
         and the mobile station supports CTM text telephony;

     -   the bearer capability 1 information element received in the SETUP message indicates speech and is accepted
         and the mobile station supports other codecs for GERAN than GSM speech version 1;

     -   the bearer capability 1 information element received in the SETUP message included the "fixed network user
         rate" parameter.

When the bearer capability 1 information element is followed by the bearer capability 2 IE in the SETUP, the above
rules apply to both bearer capability 1 IE and bearer capability 2 IE. Except those cases identified in 3GPP TS
27.001 [36], if either bearer capability needs to be included, both shall be included.

Furthermore, both bearer capability information elements may be present if the mobile station wishes to reverse the
order of occurrence of the bearer capability information elements (which is referred to in the repeat indicator
information element, see subclause 10.5.4.22) in cases identified in 3GPP TS 27.001 [36].

If the mobile station wishes to indicate capability for an alternative call mode, which can be entered during the call
through in-call modification, this is indicated by adding a bearer capability information element (bearer capability 2
information element, see subclause 5.3.6).

9.3.23.1.2           Bearer capability 1 and bearer capability 2
The bearer capability 1 information element may be omitted in the case where the mobile subscriber is allocated only
one directory number for all services (ref.: 3GPP TS 29.007 [38]). The bearer capability 2 IE is missing at least if the
bearer capability 1 IE is missing.

If the MSC wishes to indicate capability for an altenative call mode, which can be entered through fallback, this is
indicated by adding a bearer capability information element (bearer capability) 2 element (see subclause 5.3.6).

9.3.23.1.3           Facility
This information element may be included for functional operation of supplementary services.

9.3.23.1.4           Progress indicator
This information element is included by the network

   -   in order to pass information about the call in progress e.g. in the event of interworking and/or

   -   to make the MS attach the user connection for speech.

For all bands except for PCS1900, the maximum length of this IE sent by the network shall be 13 octets

9.3.23.1.5           Called party subaddress
Included in the Network-to-mobile station direction if the calling user includes a called party subaddress information
element in the SETUP message.

9.3.23.1.6           LLC repeat indicator
The LLC repeat indicator information element is included if and only if both following conditions hold:

   -   The BC repeat indicator IE is contained in the message.

   -   The low layer compatibility I IE is contained in the message.

If included, the LLC repeat indicator shall specify the same repeat indication as the BC repeat indicator IE.

9.3.23.1.7           Low layer compatibility I
Included in the network-to-mobile station direction if the calling user specified a low layer compatibility.

Included if and only if the HLC repeat indicator information element is contained in the message.

9.3.23.1.12           User-user
May be included in the network to called mobile station direction when the calling remote user included a user-user
information element in the SETUP message.

9.3.23.1.13           Redirecting party BCD number
May be included in the network to called mobile station direction when the call has been redirected.

9.3.23.1.14           Redirecting party subaddress
May be included in the network to called mobile station direction when the calling remote user included a called party
subaddress in the SETUP message and the call has been redirected

9.3.23.1.15           Priority
May be included by the network to indicate the priority of the incoming call if eMLPP is used.

9.3.23.1.16           Alert $(Network Indication of Alerting in the MS)$
May be included by the network to give some indication about alerting (category or level). If supported in the MS, this
optional indication is to be used by the MS as specified in 3GPP TS 22.101 [8].

9.3.23.1.17           Network Call Control Capabilities
This information shall be included by the network to indicate its call control capabilities if the network supports
multicall.and there are no other ongoing calls to the MS.

9.3.23.1.18           Cause of No CLI
This IE may be included by the network as defined by 3GPP TS 24.081 [25].

When both Calling Party BCD number IE and Cause of No CLI IE are included in SETUP message then the Cause of
No CLI IE provides additional information on why the number digits are not present.

9.3.23.1.19           Backup bearer capability
The backup bearer capability IE may be included by the network only if there are no bearer capability IEs contained in
the message.

   NOTE:        The MSC may use the backup bearer capability IE if it is not able to provide a complete bearer
                capability IE.




9.3.23.2           Setup (mobile originating call establishment)

9.3.31.1             User-user
Some networks may only support a maximum length of 35 octets. Procedures for interworking are not currently defined
and are for further study.

R98 and earlier versions of this protocol specified a minimum length of 3 octets for this information element (not
counting the IEI). To avoid interworking problems with mobile stations supporting only R98 or earlier versions of the
protocol, the network shall deliver the User information message to these mobile stations only if the length of the User-
user IE is greater or equal to 3 octets (not counting the IEI).

10            General message format and information elements
              coding
The figures and text in this clause describe the Information Elements contents.


10.1          Overview
Within the Layer 3 protocols defined in 3GPP TS 24.008, every message is a standard L3 message as defined in 3GPP
TS 24.007 [20]. This means that the message consists of the following parts:

       a) protocol discriminator;

       b) transaction identifier;

       c) message type;

       d) other information elements, as required.

This organization is illustrated in the example shown in figure 10.1/3GPP TS 24.008.




                    Figure 10.1/3GPP TS 24.008 General message organization example

Unless specified otherwise in the message descriptions of clause 9, a particular information element shall not be present
more than once in a given message.

The term "default" implies that the value defined shall be used in the absence of any assignment, or that this value
allows negotiation of alternative values in between the two peer entities.

When a field extends over more than one octet, the order of bit values progressively decreases as the octet number
increases. The least significant bit of the field is represented by the lowest numbered bit of the highest numbered octet
of the field.


10.2          Protocol Discriminator
The Protocol Discriminator (PD) and its use are defined in 3GPP TS 24.007 [20].


10.3          Skip indicator and transaction identifier
10.3.1        Skip indicator
Bits 5 to 8 of the first octet of every Mobility Management message and GPRS MobilityManagement message contains
the skip indicator.

With the exception of the following cases for a shared GERAN network in A/Gb mode,

   -   when the MS is sending a LOCATION UPDATING REQUEST, CM SERVICE REQUEST, IMSI DETACH
       INDICATION or CM RE-ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message; or




                                                           ETSI
3GPP TS 24.008 version 15.8.0 Release 15                     485                       ETSI TS 124 008 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


   -     when the network is receiving a LOCATION UPDATING REQUEST, PAGING RESPONSE, CM SERVICE
         REQUEST, IMSI DETACH INDICATION or CM RE-ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message,

the skip indicator field shall be handled as follows:

   a) A message received with skip indicator different from 0000 shall be ignored. A message received with skip
      indicator encoded as 0000 shall not be considered an error that causes the message to be ignored.

   b) A protocol entity sending a Mobility Management message or a GPRS Mobility Management message shall
      encode the skip indicator as 0000.

In a shared GERAN network in A/Gb mode:

   a) When the MS is sending a LOCATION UPDATING REQUEST, CM SERVICE REQUEST, IMSI DETACH
      INDICATION or CM RE-ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message,

         -   if the MS is a GERAN network sharing supporting MS, the MS shall encode the skip indicator IE to indicate
             the chosen PLMN identity from the PLMN identities in the broadcast system information (see
             3GPP TS 44.018 [84]) according to table 10.3.1;

         -   otherwise, the MS shall encode the skip indicator as 0000.

   b) When the network is receiving a LOCATION UPDATING REQUEST, PAGING RESPONSE, CM SERVICE
      REQUEST, IMSI DETACH INDICATION or CM RE-ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message,

         -   if the skip indicator is encoded as 0000, the message shall not be considered an error that causes the message
             to be ignored;

         -   if the skip indicator is different from 0000, the message shall not be considered an error and shall be
             processed by the receiving MM entity. The MS shall be considered as GERAN network sharing supporting
             MS.

   NOTE:         The skip indicator handling of PAGING RESPONSE message on the MS and the BSS is specified in
                 3GPP TS 44.018 [84].

  All other values shall be interpreted as "Skip Indicator without indication of selected PLMN".

  Value 0000 indicates no indication of selected PLMN from the MS, which happens in UTRAN, or non-
  shared GERAN or Multi-Operator Core Network (MOCN) with common GERAN configurations or in a
  shared GERAN if the MS does not support GERAN network sharing.

10.3.2        Transaction identifier
Bits 5 to 8 of the first octet of every message belonging to the protocols "Call Control; call related SS messages" and
"Session Management"contain the transaction identifier (TI). The transaction identifier and its use are defined in 3GPP
TS 24.007 [20].

For the session management protocol, the extended TI mechanism may be used (see 3GPP TS 24.007 [20]).

For the call control protocol, the extended TI mechanism shall be supported for the purpose of protocol error handling
as specified in subclause 8.3.1


10.4          Message Type
The message type IE and its use are defined in 3GPP TS 24.007 [20]. Tables 10.3/3GPP TS 24.008,
10.4/3GPP TS 24.008, and 10.4a/3GPP TS 24.008 define the value part of the message type IE used in the Mobility
Management protocol, the Call Control protocol, and Session management protocol.

10.5          Other information elements
The different formats (V, LV, T, TV, TLV) and the four categories of information elements (type 1, 2, 3, and 4) are
defined in 3GPP TS 24.007 [20].

The first octet of an information element in the non-imperative part contains the IEI of the information element. If this
octet does not correspond to an IEI known in the message, the receiver shall determine whether this IE is of type 1 or 2
(i.e. it is an information element of one octet length) or an IE of type 4 (i.e. that the next octet is the length indicator
indicating the length of the remaining of the information element) (see 3GPP TS 24.007 [20]).

This allows the receiver to jump over unknown information elements and to analyse any following information
elements.

The information elements which are common for at least two of the three protocols Radio Resources management,
Mobility Management and Call Control, are listed in subclause 10.5.1.

The information elements for the protocols Mobility Management and Call Control are listed in subclauses 10.5.3 and
10.5.4 respectively. Default information element identifiers are listed in annex K.




                                                              ETSI
3GPP TS 24.008 version 15.8.0 Release 15                       490                      ETSI TS 124 008 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


   NOTE:      Different information elements may have the same default information element identifier if they belong to
              different protocols.

The descriptions of the information element types in subclauses 10.5.1, 10.5.3, and 10.5.4 are organized in alphabetical
order of the IE types. Each IE type is described in one subclause.

The subclause may have an introduction:

   -   possibly explaining the purpose of the IE;

   -   possibly describing whether the IE belongs to type 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5;

   -   possibly indicating the length that the information element has if it is either type 5 or if it is used in format TV
       (type 1 and 3) or TLV (type 4).

A figure of the subclause defines the structure of the IE indicating:

   -   possibly the position and length of the IEI. (However it depends on the message in which the IE occurs whether
       the IE contains an IEI.);

   -   the fields the IE value part is composed of;

   -   possibly the position and length of the length indicator. (However it depends on the IE type whether the IE
       contains a length indicator or not.);

   -   possibly octet numbers of the octets that compose the IE (see clause a) below).

Finally, the subclause contains tables defining the structure and value range of the fields that compose the IE value part.
The order of appearance for information elements in a message is defined in clause 9.

The order of the information elements within the imperative part of messages has been chosen so that information
elements with 1/2 octet of content (type 1) go together in succession. The first type 1 information element occupies bits
1 to 4 of octet N, the second bits 5 to 8 of octet N, the third bits 1 to 4 of octet N + 1 etc. If the number of type 1
information elements is odd then bits 5 to 8 of the last octet occupied by these information elements contains a spare
half octet IE in format V.

Where the description of information elements in the present document contains bits defined to be "spare bits", these
bits shall set to the indicated value (0 or 1) by the sending side, and their value shall be ignored by the receiving side.
With few exceptions, spare bits are indicated as being set to "0" in 3GPP TS 24.008.


10.5.1        Common information elements.

10.5.1.1          Cell identity
The purpose of the Cell Identity information element is to identify a cell within a location area.

The Cell Identity information element is coded as shown in figure 10.5.1/3GPP TS 24.008 and table 10.5.1/3GPP TS
24.008.

The Cell Identity is a type 3 information element with 3 octets length.

                  least significant bit.

                  The coding of the cell identity is the responsibility of each administration. Coding
                  using full hexadecimal representation may be used.
                  The cell identity consists of 2 octets.




10.5.1.2         Ciphering Key Sequence Number
In a GSM authentication challenge, the purpose of the Ciphering Key Sequence Number information element is to make
it possible for the network to identify the ciphering key Kc which is stored in the mobile station without invoking the
authentication procedure.

The ciphering key sequence number is allocated by the network and sent with the AUTHENTICATION REQUEST or
AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING REQUEST message to the mobile station where it is stored together with the
calculated keys, e.g. Kc, CK, IK, Kc128, Kint.

The Ciphering Key Sequence Number information element is coded as shown in figure 10.5.2/3GPP TS 24.008 and
table 10.5.2/3GPP TS 24.008.

In a UMTS authentication challenge, the purpose of the Ciphering Key Sequence Number information element is to
make it possible for the network to identify the ciphering key CK and integrity key IK which are stored in the MS
without invoking the authentication procedure. CK and IK form a Key Set Identifier (KSI) (see 3GPP TS 33.102 [5a])
which is encoded the same as the CKSN and is therefore included in the CKSN field.

The ciphering key sequence number is a type 1 information element.

10.5.1.3         Location Area Identification
The purpose of the Location Area Identification information element is to provide an unambiguous identification of
location areas within the area covered by the 3GPP system.

The Location Area Identification information element is coded as shown in figure 10.5.3/3GPP TS 24.008 and
table 10.5.3/3GPP TS 24.008.

                   MCC, Mobile country code (octet 2 and 3)
                   The MCC field is coded as in ITU-T Rec. E212, Annex A.

                   If the LAI is deleted the MCC and MNC shall take the value from the deleted LAI.

                   In abnormal cases, the MCC stored in the mobile station can contain elements not
                   in the set {0, 1 ... 9}. In such cases the mobile station should transmit the stored
                   values using full hexadecimal encoding. When receiving such an MCC, the network
                   shall treat the LAI as deleted.

                   MNC, Mobile network code (octet 3 bits 5 to 8, octet 4)
                   The coding of this field is the responsibility of each administration but BCD coding
                   shall be used. The MNC shall consist of 2 or 3 digits. For PCS 1900 for NA, Federal
                   regulation mandates that a 3-digit MNC shall be used. However a network operator
                   may decide to use only two digits in the MNC in the LAI over the radio interface. In
                   this case, bits 5 to 8 of octet 3 shall be coded as "1111". Mobile equipment shall
                   accept LAI coded in such a way.

                   NOTE 1: In earlier versions of this protocol, the possibility to use a one digit MNC
                           in LAI was provided on the radio interface. However as this was not used
                           this possibility has been deleted.

                   NOTE 2: In earlier versions of this protocol, bits 5 to 8 of octet 3 were coded as
                           "1111". Mobile equipment compliant with these earlier versions of the
                           protocol may be unable to understand the 3-digit MNC format of the LAI,
                           and therefore unable to register on a network broadcasting the LAI in this
                           format.

                   In abnormal cases, the MNC stored in the mobile station can have:
                   - digit 1 or 2 not in the set {0, 1 ... 9}, or
                   - digit 3 not in the set {0, 1 ... 9, F} hex.
                   In such cases the mobile station shall transmit the stored values using full
                   hexadecimal encoding. When receiving such an MNC, the network shall treat the
                   LAI as deleted.

                   The same handling shall apply for the network, if a 3-digit MNC is sent by the
                   mobile station to a network using only a 2-digit MNC.

                   LAC, Location area code (octet 5 and 6)
                   In the LAC field bit 8 of octet 5 is the most significant bit and bit 1 of octet 6 the
                   least significant bit.
                   The coding of the location area code is the responsibility of each administration
                   except that two values are used to mark the LAC, and hence the LAI, as deleted.
                   Coding using full hexadecimal representation may be used. The location area code
                   consists of 2 octets.
                   If a LAI has to be deleted then all bits of the location area code shall be set to one
                   with the exception of the least significant bit which shall be set to zero. If a
                   SIM/USIM is inserted in a Mobile Equipment with the location area code containing
                   all zeros, then the Mobile Equipment shall recognise this LAC as part of a deleted
                   LAI




10.5.1.4         Mobile Identity
The purpose of the Mobile Identity information element is to provide either the international mobile subscriber identity,
IMSI, the temporary mobile subscriber identity, TMSI/P-TMSI/M-TMSI, the international mobile equipment identity,
IMEI, the international mobile equipment identity together with the software version number, IMEISV, or the
temporary mobile group identity (TMGI), associated with the optional MBMS Session Identity.

The IMSI shall not exceed 15 digits, the TMSI/P-TMSI/M-TMSI is 4 octets long, and the IMEI is composed of 15
digits, the IMEISV is 16 digits (see 3GPP TS 23.003 [10]). The TMGI is at maximum 6 octets long and is defined in
subclause 10.5.6.13. The MBMS Session Identity, if included, is 1 octet long (see 3GPP TS 48.018 [86]).

For packet paging the network shall select the mobile identity type with the following priority:

       1- P-TMSI: The P-TMSI shall be used if it is available.

       2- IMSI: The IMSI shall be used in cases where no P-TMSI is available.

For MBMS (pre-)notification (see 3GPP TS 44.018 [84] and 3GPP TS 44.060 [76]) the network shall select the mobile
identity type "TMGI and optional MBMS Session Identity".

   NOTE 1: The type of identity "TMGI and optional MBMS Session Identity" is only used by the MBMS
           (pre-)notification procedure in of A/Gb mode.

For all other transactions with the following exceptions:

   -   emergency call establishment, emergency call re-establishment, mobile terminated call establishment, the
       identification procedure, the GMM identification procedure, the GMM authentication, GPRS attach, routing area
       updating, and ciphering procedure and the ciphering mode setting procedure; and

   -   location updating when the MS is configured for "AttachWithIMSI" as specified in 3GPP TS 24.368 [135] or
       3GPP TS 31.102 [112] and the selected PLMN is neither the registered PLMN nor in the list of equivalent
       PLMNs;

the mobile station and the network shall select the mobile identity type with the following priority:

       1- TMSI: The TMSI shall be used if it is available.

       2- IMSI: The IMSI shall be used in cases where no TMSI is available.

For mobile terminated call establishment the mobile station shall select the same mobile identity type as received from
the network in the PAGING REQUEST message. In case of enhanced DTM CS establishment (see 3GPP TS 44.018
[84]) the mobile station shall select the mobile identity type with the following priority in the PAGING RESPONSE
message:

       1- TMSI: The TMSI shall be used if it is available.

       2- IMSI: The IMSI shall be used in cases where no TMSI is available.

For the PAGING RESPONSE message sent as a response to a paging for CS fallback, the MS shall:

   -   select the TMSI as mobile identity type if the network has, in E-UTRAN,

       -   paged the MS for CS fallback using the S-TMSI; or

       -   indicated TMSI in the CS SERVICE NOTIFICATION message (see 3GPP TS 24.301 [120]);

   -   select the IMSI as mobile identity type if the network has, in E-UTRAN,

       -   paged the MS for CS fallback using the IMSI; or

       -   indicated IMSI in the CS SERVICE NOTIFICATION message (see 3GPP TS 24.301 [120]).

For emergency call establishment and re-establishment the mobile station shall select the mobile identity type with the
following priority:

       1- TMSI: The TMSI shall be used if it is available and if the location update status is UPDATED, and the stored
          LAI is equal to the one received on the BCCH from the current serving cell.

       2- IMSI: The IMSI shall be used in cases where no TMSI is available or TMSI is available but either the update
          status is different from UPDATED, or the stored LAI is different from the one received on the BCCH from
          the current serving cell.

       3- IMEI: The IMEI shall be used in cases where no SIM/USIM is available or the SIM/USIM is considered as
          not valid by the mobile station or no IMSI or TMSI is available.

In the identification procedure and in the GMM identification procedure the mobile station shall select the mobile
identity type which was requested by the network, if available. If the requested identity is not available, then the mobile
station shall indicate the identity type "No Identity".

                Identity digits (octet 3 etc)

                For the IMSI, IMEI and IMEISV this field is coded using BCD coding. If the number
                of identity digits is even then bits 5 to 8 of the last octet shall be filled with an end
                mark coded as "1111".

                For Type of identity "No Identity", the Identity digit bits shall be encoded with all 0s
                and the Length of mobile identity contents parameter shall be set to one of the
                following values:
                - "1" if the identification procedure is used (see subclause 9.2.11);
                - "3" if the GMM identification procedure is used (see subclause 9.4.13)
                - "3" if the EMM identification procedure is used (see 3GPP TS 24.301 [120])

                If the mobile identity is the TMSI/P-TMSI/M-TMSI then bits 5 to 8 of octet 3 are
                coded as "1111" and bit 8 of octet4 is the most significant bit and bit 1 of the last
                octet the least significant bit. The coding of the TMSI/P-TMSI is left open for each
                administration.

                For type of identity "TMGI and optional MBMS Session Identity" the coding of octet
                3 etc is as follows:

                MCC/MNC indication (octet 3)
                Bit
                5
                0      MCC/MNC is not present
                1      MCC/MNC is present

                Bit
                6
                0      MBMS Session Identity is not present
                1      MBMS Session Identity is present
                MBMS Service ID (octet 4, 5 and 6)

                The contents of the MBMS Service ID field are coded as octets 3 to 5 of the
                Temporary Mobile Group Identity IE in Figure 10.5.154/3GPP TS 24.008.
                Therefore, bit 8 of octet 4 is the most significant bit and bit 1 of octet 6 the least
                significant bit. The coding of the MBMS Service ID is the responsibility of each
                administration. Coding using full hexadecimal representation may be used. The
                MBMS Service ID consists of 3 octets.

                MCC, Mobile country code (octet 6a, octet 6b bits 1 to 4)

                The MCC field is coded as in ITU-T Rec. E.212 [46], Annex A.

                  MNC, Mobile network code (octet 6b bits 5 to 8, octet 6c)

                  The coding of this field is the responsibility of each administration but BCD coding
                  shall be used. The MNC shall consist of 2 or 3 digits. If a network operator decides
                  to use only two digits in the MNC, bits 5 to 8 of octet 6b shall be coded as "1111".

                  The contents of the MCC and MNC digits are coded as octets 6 to 8 of the
                  Temporary Mobile Group Identity IE in Figure 10.5.154/3GPP TS 24.008.

                  MBMS Session Identity (octet 7)

                  The MBMS Session Identity field is encoded as the value part of the MBMS
                  Session Identity IE as specified in 3GPP TS 48.018 [86].

                  NOTE 1: This can be used in the case when a fill paging message without any
                          valid identity has to be sent on the paging subchannel and when the
                          requested identity is not available at the mobile station during the identity
                          request procedure.



10.5.1.5          Mobile Station Classmark 1
The purpose of the Mobile Station Classmark 1 information element is to provide the network with information
concerning aspects of high priority of the mobile station equipment. This affects the manner in which the network
handles the operation of the mobile station. The Mobile Station Classmark information indicates general mobile station
characteristics and it shall therefore, except for fields explicitly indicated, be independent of the frequency band of the
channel it is sent on.

The Mobile Station Classmark 1 information element is coded as shown in figure 10.5.5/3GPP TS 24.008 and
table 10.5.5/3GPP TS 24.008.

The Mobile Station Classmark 1 is a type 3 information element with 2 octets length.

10.5.1.6           Mobile Station Classmark 2
The purpose of the Mobile Station Classmark 2 information element is to provide the network with information
concerning aspects of both high and low priority of the mobile station equipment. This affects the manner in which the
network handles the operation of the mobile station. The Mobile Station Classmark information indicates general
mobile station characteristics and it shall therefore, except for fields explicitly indicated, be independent of the
frequency band of the channel it is sent on.

The Mobile Station Classmark 2 information element is coded as shown in figure 10.5.6/3GPP TS 24.008,
table 10.5.6a/3GPP TS 24.008 and table 10.5.6b/3GPP TS 24.008.

The Mobile Station Classmark 2 is a type 4 information element with 5 octets length.

10.5.1.7           Mobile Station Classmark 3
The purpose of the Mobile Station Classmark 3 information element is to provide the network with information
concerning aspects of the mobile station. The contents might affect the manner in which the network handles the
operation of the mobile station. The Mobile Station Classmark information indicates general mobile station
characteristics and it shall therefore, except for fields explicitly indicated, be independent of the frequency band of the
channel it is sent on.

The Mobile Station Classmark 3 is a type 4 information element with a maximum of 34 octets length.

The value part of a Mobile Station Classmark 3 information element is coded as shown in figure 10.5.1.7/3GPP TS
24.008 and table 10.5.1.7/3GPP TS 24.008.

   NOTE:        The 34 octet limit is so that the CLASSMARK CHANGE message will fit in up to two layer 2 frames.

SEMANTIC RULE: a multiband mobile station shall provide information about all frequency bands it can support. A
single band mobile station shall not indicate the band it supports in the Multiband Supported, GSM 400 Bands
Supported, GSM 710 Associated Radio Capability, GSM 750 Associated Radio Capability, T-GSM 810 Associated
Radio Capability, GSM 850 Associated Radio Capability or GSM 1900 Associated Radio Capability fields in the
Mobile Station Classmark 3. Due to shared radio frequency channel numbers between GSM 1800 and GSM 1900, the
mobile should indicate support for either GSM 1800 band OR GSM 1900 band.

SEMANTIC RULE: a mobile station shall include the MS Measurement Capability field if the Multi Slot Class field
contains a value of 19 or greater (see 3GPP TS 45.002 [32]).

Typically, the number of spare bits at the end is the minimum to reach an octet boundary. The receiver may add any
number of bits set to "0" at the end of the received string if needed for correct decoding.

    The indication of support of P-GSM band or E-GSM or R-GSM band is mutually exclusive.

    When the 'Band 2 supported' bit indicates support of E-GSM or R-GSM, the presence of the <R Support> field,
    see below, indicates if the E-GSM or R-GSM band is supported.

    In this version of the protocol, the sender indicates in this field either none, one or two of these 3 bands
    supported.

    For single band mobile station or a mobile station supporting none of the GSM 900 bands(P-GSM, E-GSM and
    R-GSM) and GSM 1800 bands, all bits are set to 0.

    Associated Radio capability 1 and 2 (4 bit fields)

    If either of P-GSM or E-GSM or R-GSM is supported, the radio capability 1 field indicates the radio capability for
    P-GSM, E-GSM or R-GSM, and the radio capability 2 field indicates the radio capability for GSM 1800 if
    supported, and is spare otherwise.

    If none of P-GSM or E-GSM or R-GSM are supported, the radio capability 1 field indicates the radio capability
    for GSM 1800, and the radio capability 2 field is spare.

    The radio capability contains the binary coding of the power class associated with the band indicated in
    multiband support bits (see 3GPP TS 45.005 [33]).

ISO/IEC 10646 [72] are received in the text string, the MS shall use the MCC of the PLMN from which it received the
network name information element to determine the language for those CJKV ideographs as specified in
table 10.5.93a/3GPP TS 24.008:

   NOTE:     This is due to CJKV ideograph language ambiguity in UCS2, in the sense that the same hexadecimal code
             can be mapped to different character displays dependent on the used language. The coding of CJKV
             ideographs itself does not allow to discriminate the CJKV ideograph language.

The Network Name is a type 4 information element with a minimum length of 3 octets. No upper length limit is
specified except for that given by the maximum number of octets in a L3 message (see 3GPP TS 44.006 [19]).

                  1 1 1 value indicates that the timer is deactivated.

                  Other values shall be interpreted as multiples of 1 minute in this version of the
                  protocol.

                  The value indicated is contructed by multiplying the value in bits 5 to 1 with the timer
                  value unit in bits 8 to 6, unless the timer value unit indicates the timer being
                  deactivated.




10.5.4        Call control information elements

10.5.4.1          Extensions of codesets
There is a certain number of possible information element identifier values using the formatting rules described in
subclause 10.5: 128 from the type 3 & 4 information element format and at least 8 from the type 1 & 2 information
element format.

One value in the type 1 format is specified for shift operations described below. One other value in both the type 3 & 4
and type 1 format is reserved. This leaves 133 information element identifier values available for assignment.

It is possible to expand this structure to eight codesets of 133 information element identifier values each. One common
value in the type 1 format is employed in each codeset to facilitate shifting from one codeset to another. The contents of
this shift information element identifies the codeset to be used for the next information element or elements. The
codeset in use at any given time is referred to as the "active codeset". By convention, codeset 0 is the initially active
codeset.

Two codeset shifting procedures are supported: locking shift and non-locking shift.

Codeset 5 is reserved for information elements reserved for national use.

Codeset 6 is reserved for information elements specific to the local network (either public or private).

Codeset 7 is reserved for user-specific information elements.

The coding rules specified in subclause 10.5 shall apply for information elements belonging to any active codeset.




                                                           ETSI
3GPP TS 24.008 version 15.8.0 Release 15                         542                          ETSI TS 124 008 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


The mobile station and the network shall not apply the "comprehension required" scheme (see 3GPP TS 24.007 [20]) to
information elements belonging to codesets different from codeset 0.

IEIs with bits 5, 6, 7 and 8 all set to zero should not be allocated for new optional information elements in codesets
different from codeset 0, because there are legacy mobile stations that apply the "comprehension required" scheme also
to these information elements, e.g. if such a mobile station receives a SETUP message containing an unknown
information element from codeset 5 with an IEI with bits 5, 6, 7 and 8 all set to zero, then the mobile station will release
the call.

Transitions from one active codeset to another (i.e. by means of the locking shift procedure) may only be made to a
codeset with a higher numerical value than the codeset being left.

An information element belonging to codeset 5, 6 or 7 may appear together with information elements belonging to
codeset 0, by using the non-locking shift procedure (see subclause 10.5.4.3).

A user or network equipment shall have the capability to recognize a shift information element and to determine the
length of the following information element, although the equipment need not be able to interpret and act on the content
of the information element. This enables the equipment to determine the start of the subsequent information element.

10.5.4.2          Locking shift procedure
The locking shift procedure employs an information element to indicate the new active codeset. The specified codeset
remains active until another locking shift information element is encountered which specifies the use of another codeset.
For example, codeset 0 is active at the start of message content analysis. If a locking shift to codeset 5 is encountered,
the next information elements will be interpreted according to the information element identifiers assigned in codeset 5,
until another shift information element is encountered. This procedure is used only to shift to a higher order codeset
than the one being left.

The locking shift is valid only within that message which contains the locking shift information element. At the start of
every message content analysis, the active codeset is codeset 0.

The locking shift information element uses the type 1 information element format and coding shown in
figure 10.5.85/3GPP TS 24.008 and table 10.5.98/3GPP TS 24.008.

10.5.4.3          Non-locking shift procedure
The non-locking shift procedure provides a temporary shift to the specified lower or higher codeset. The non-locking
shift procedure uses a type 1 information element to indicate the codeset to be used to interpret the next information



                                                                ETSI

element. After the interpretation of the next information element, the active codeset is again used for interpreting any
following information elements. For example, codeset 0 is active at the beginning of message content analysis. If a non-
locking shift to codeset 6 is encountered, only the next information element is interpreted according to the information
element identifiers assigned in codeset 6. After this information element is interpreted, codeset 0 will again be used to
interpret the following information elements. A non-locking shift information element indicating the current codeset
shall not be regarded as an error.

A locking shift information element shall not follow directly a non-locking shift information element. If this
combination is received, it shall be interpreted as though a locking shift information element had been received.

The non-locking shift information element uses the type 1 information format and coding shown in figure 10.5.86/3GPP

10.5.4.4a        Backup bearer capability
The purpose of the backup bearer capability IE is to indicate a requested service to a MS in case a complete description
of the bearer service by a bearer capability IE is not available. The backup bearer capability information element is not
subject to compatibility checking as described in annex B.

The backup bearer capability IE is coded as shown in figure 10.5.87a/3GPP TS 24.008 and
tables 10.5.101a/3GPP TS 24.008 to 10.5.101m/3GPP TS 24.008.

The backup bearer capability is a type 4 information element with a minimum length of 3 octets and a maximum length
of 15 octets.

   NOTE 1: The coding of the octets of the bearer capability information element is not conforming to
           ITU Recommendation Q.931 [53].

An MS shall encode the Bearer Capability infomation element according to A/Gb mode call control requirements also if
it is requesting for a service in Iu mode, with the following exceptions:

   1. A mobile station not supporting A/Gb mode and GERAN Iu mode for the requested bearer service shall set the
      following parameters to the value "0":
      - Maximum number of traffic channels (octet 6e, bits 1-3)
      - Acceptable Channel coding(s) (octet 6e, bits 4, 5 and 7)

   2. Furthermore, a mobile station not supporting A/Gb mode and GERAN Iu mode for the requested bearer service
      shall also set the following parameters to the value "0", if the respective octets have to be included in the bearer
      capability information element according to subclause 10.5.4.5.1 and 3GPP TS 27.001 [36]:
      - UIMI, User initiated modification indication (octet 6f, bits 5-7)
      - Acceptable Channel Codings extended (octet 6g, bits 5-7)

For UTRAN Iu mode the following parameters are irrelevant for specifying the radio access bearer, because multiple
traffic channels (multislot) are not deployed, see 3GPP TS 23.034 [104]. However, the parameters if received, shall be
stored in the MSC, and used for handover to A/Gb or GERAN Iu mode:
- Maximum number of traffic channels (octet 6e, bits 1-3)
- Acceptable Channel coding(s) (octet 6e, bits 4, 5 and 7)
- UIMI, User initiated modification indication (octet 6f, bits 5-7)
- Acceptable Channel Codings extended (octet 6g, bits 5-7)

   NOTE 2: The following parameters are relevant in UTRAN Iu mode for non transparent data calls for deciding
           which RLP version to negotiate in order to avoid renegotiation of RLP version in case of inter-system
           handover from UTRAN Iu mode to A/Gb or GERAN Iu mode, see 3GPP TS 24.022 [141]:
           - Maximum number of traffic channels (octet 6e, bits 1-3)
           - Wanted air interface user rate (octet 6f, bits 1- 4)
           - UIMI, User initiated modification indication (octet 6f, bits 5-7).

                 NOTE 1: The odd/even indicator is used when the type of subaddress is "user
                         specified" and the coding is BCD.

                 Subaddress information (octet 4, etc...)
                 The NSAP X.213/ISO8348AD2 address shall be formatted as specified by octet 4
                 which contains the Authority and Format Identifier (AFI). The encoding is made
                 according to the "preferred binary encoding" as defined in X.213 [144]/ISO8348AD2.
                 For the definition of this type of subaddress, see ITU-T Rec. I.334 [145].

                 A coding example is given in ANNEX A.

                 For User-specific subaddress, this field is encoded according to the user specification,
                 subject to a maximum length of 20 octets.

                 NOTE 2: It is recommended that users apply NSAP subaddress type since this
                         subaddress type allows the use of decimal, binary and IA5 characters in a
                         standardised manner.



10.5.4.9         Calling party BCD number
The purpose of the calling party BCD number information element is to identify the origin of a call.

The calling party BCD number information element is coded as shown in figure 10.5.93/3GPP TS 24.008 and
table 10.5.120/3GPP TS 24.008.

The calling party BCD number is a type 4 information element. In the network to mobile station direction it has a
minimum length of 3 octets and a maximum length of 14 octets. (This information element is not used in the mobile
station to network direction.).

10.5.4.10         Calling party subaddress
The purpose of the Calling party subaddress is to identify a subaddress associated with the origin of a call. For the
definition of a subaddress see ITU-T Rec. I.330 [48].

The Calling party subaddress information element is coded as shown in figure 10.5.94/3GPP TS 24.008 and
table 10.5.121/3GPP TS 24.008.

The calling party subaddress is a type 4 information element with a minimum length of 2 octets and a maximum length
of 23 octets.

                Subaddress information (octet 4, etc...)
                The NSAP X.213/ISO8348AD2 address shall be formatted as specified by octet 4
                which contains the Authority and Format Identifier (AFI). The encoding is made
                according to the "preferred binary encoding" as defined in ITU-
                T Rec. X.213 [144]/ISO8348AD2. For the definition of this type of this type of
                subaddress, see ITU-T Rec. I.334 [145].

                A coding example is given in annex A.

                For User-specific subaddress, this field is encoded according to the user specification,
                subject to a maximum length of 20 octets.

                NOTE:      It is recommended that users apply NSAP subad dress type since this
                           subaddress type allows the use of decimal, binary and IA5 characters in a
                           standardised manner.



10.5.4.11        Cause
The purpose of the cause information element is to describe the reason for generating certain messages, to provide
diagnostic information in the event of procedural errors and to indicate the location of the cause originator.

The cause information element is coded as shown in figure 10.5.95/3GPP TS 24.008 and tables 10.5.122 and
10.5.123/3GPP TS 24.008.

The cause is a type 4 information element with a minimum length of 4 octets and a maximum length of 32 octets.

The cause information element may be repeated in a message.

   NOTE 1: Diagnostics for supplementary services are handled as follows:

             octet 5, bit 8:

                   This is an extension bit as defined in the preliminary part of subclause 10.5. In this version of this
                   protocol, this bit shall be set to 1. If it is set to zero, the contents of the following octets shall be ignored.

             octet 5, bit 7-1:

                         0000001 - Outgoing calls barred within CUG

                         0000010 - No CUG selected

                         0000011 - Unknown CUG index

                         0000100 - CUG index incompatible with requested basic service

                         0000101 - CUG call failure, unspecified

                         0000110 - CLIR not subscribed

3GPP TS 24.008 version 15.8.0 Release 15                       580                   ETSI TS 124 008 V15.8.0 (2020-01)


                 0000111 - CCBS possible

                 0001000 - CCBS not possible

                 All other values shall be ignored.

   NOTE 2: The incompatible parameter is composed of the incompatible information element identifier.

   NOTE 3: The format of the diagnostic field for cause numbers 57, 58 and 65 is as shown in figure 10.5.88/3GPP
           TS 24.008 and tables 10.5.102/3GPP TS 24.008 to 10.5.115/3GPP TS 24.008.

   NOTE 4: The user supplied diagnostics field is encoded according to the user specification, subject to the
           maximum length of the cause information element. The coding of user supplied diagnostics should be
           made in such a way that it does not conflict with the coding described in note 9 below.

   NOTE 5: The new destination is formatted as the called party BCD number information element, including
           information element identifier.

   NOTE 6: Locking and non-locking shift procedures described in subclause 10.5.4.2 and clause 3 are applied. In
           principle, information element identifiers are ordered in the same order as the information elements in the
           received message.

   NOTE 7: When only the locking shift information element is included and no information element identifier
           follows, it means that the codeset in the locking shift itself is not implemented.

   NOTE 8: The timer number is coded in IA5 characters, e.g., T308 is coded as "3" "0" "8". The following coding is
           used in each octet:

             bit 8: spare "0"

             bits 7-1: IA5 character

             Octet 5 carries "3", octet 5a carries "0", etc.

   NOTE 9: The following coding is used for octet 5:

             bit 8     :1

             bits 7-3: 00000

             bits 2-1: condition as follows:

                 00 - unknown

                 01 - permanent

                 10 - transient

10.5.4.16         High layer compatibility
The purpose of the high layer compatibility information element is to provide a means which should be used by the
remote user for compatibility checking. See annex B.

The high layer compatibility information element is coded as shown in figure 10.5.102/3GPP TS 24.008 and
table 10.5.125/3GPP TS 24.008.

The high layer compatibility is a type 4 information element with a minimum length of 2 octets and a maximum length
of 5 octets.

   NOTE:      The high layer compatibility information element is transported transparently by a PLMN between a call
              originating entity (e.g. a calling user) and the addressed entity (e.g. a remote user or a high layer function
              network node addressed by the call originating entity). However, if explicitly requested by the user (at
              subscription time), a network which provides some capabilities to realize teleservices may interpret this
              information to provide a particular service.

   NOTE:       In the 3GPP system this information element is only used to transfer one DTMF digit (0, 1, ... , 9, A, B,
               C, D, *, #) as one IA5 character.

10.5.4.18         Low layer compatibility
The purpose of the low layer compatibility information element is to provide a means which should be used for
compatibility checking by an addressed entity (e.g., a remote user or an interworking unit or a high layer function
network node addressed by the calling user). The low layer compatibility information element is transferred
transparently by a PLMN between the call originating entity (e.g. the calling user) and the addressed entity.

Except for the information element identifier, the low layer compatibility information element is coded as in ITU
recommendation Q.931.

For backward compatibility reasons coding of the modem type field according to ETS 300 102-1 (12-90) shall also be
supported.

The low layer compatibility is a type 4 information element with a minimum length of 2 octets and a maximum length
of 18 octets.

10.5.4.25        User-user
The purpose of the user-user information element is to convey information between the mobile station and the remote
ISDN user.

The user-user information element is coded as shown in figure 10.5.114/3GPP TS 24.008 and table 10.5.131/
3GPP TS 24.008. There are no restrictions on the content of the user-user information field.

The user-user is a type 4 information element with a minimum length of 3 octets and a maximum length of either 35 or
131 octets. In the SETUP message the user-user information element has a maximum size of 35 octets in a
GSM PLMN. In the USER INFORMATION, ALERTING, CONNECT, DISCONNECT, PROGRESS, RELEASE and
RELEASE COMPLETE messages the user-user information element has a maximum size of 131 octets in a
GSM PLMN.

In other networks than GSM PLMNs the maximum size of the user-user information element is 35 or 131 octets in the
messages mentioned above. The evolution to a single maximum value is the long term objective; the exact maximum
value is the subject of further study.

   NOTE:      The user-user information element is transported transparently through a GSM PLMN.

Emergency Service Category Value (octet 3)
The meaning of the Emergency Category Value is derived from the following settings (see 3GPP TS 22.101 [8] clause
10):
Bit 1 Police
Bit 2 Ambulance
Bit 3 Fire Brigade
Bit 4 Marine Guard
Bit 5 Mountain Rescue
Bit 6 manually initiated eCall
Bit 7 automatically initiated eCall
Bit 8 is spare and set to "0"


A mobile station not initiating an eCall shall set bit 6 and bit 7 to "0" and may set one or more of bit 1, bit 2, bit 3, bit 4 or
bit 5 to "1". If more than one of these bits is set to "1", routing to a combined emergency centre (e.g. ambulance and fire
brigade in Japan) is required.

A mobile station initiating an eCall shall set either bit 6 or bit 7 to "1" and shall set all other bits to "0". A MSC supporting
eCall shall use the information indicated in bit 6 and bit 7 to route the manually or automatically initiated eCall to an
operator defined emergency call centre.

If the MSC can not match the received service category to any of the emergency centres, or if no bit is set to "1", the
MSC shall route the emergency call to an operator defined default emergency centre.

The MS Radio Access capability information element is coded as shown in figure 10.5.128a/3GPP TS 24.008 and table
10.5.146/3GPP TS 24.008.

For the indication of the radio access capabilities the following conditions shall apply:

   -   Among the three Access Type Technologies GSM 900-P, GSM 900-E and GSM 900-R only one shall be
       present.

   -   Due to shared radio frequency channel numbers between GSM 1800 and GSM 1900, the mobile station should
       provide the relevant radio access capability for either GSM 1800 band OR GSM 1900 band, not both.

   -   The MS shall indicate its supported Access Technology Types during a single MM procedure.

   -   If the alternative coding by using the Additional access technologies struct is chosen by the mobile station, the
       mobile station shall indicate its radio access capability for the serving BCCH frequency band in the first included
       Access capabilities struct, if this information element is not sent in response to an Access Technologies Request
       from the network or if none of the requested Access Technology Types is supported by the MS. Otherwise, the
       mobile station shall include the radio access capabilities for the frequency bands it supports in the order of
       priority requested by the network (see 3GPP TS 44.060 [76]).

   -   The first Access Technology Type shall not be set to "1111".

For error handling the following shall apply:

   − If a received Access Technology Type is unknown to the receiver, it shall ignore all the corresponding fields.

   − If within a known Access Technology Type a receiver recognizes an unknown field it shall ignore it.

   − For more details about error handling of MS radio access capability see 3GPP TS 48.018 [86].

   NOTE:      The requirements for the support of the A5 algorithms in the MS are specified in 3GPP TS 43.020 [13].

   MCC, Mobile country code (octet 2 and 3)

   The MCC field is coded as in ITU-T Rec. E212, Annex A.
   If the RAI is deleted, the MCC and MNC shall take the value from the deleted RAI.

   In abnormal cases, the MCC stored in the mobile station can contain elements not in the set {0, 1 ... 9}. In such
   cases the mobile station should transmit the stored values using full hexadecimal encoding. When receiving such
   an MCC, the network shall treat the RAI as deleted.

   MNC, Mobile network code (octet 3 bits 5 to 8, octet 4)

   The coding of this field is the responsibility of each administration but BCD coding shall be used. The MNC shall
   consist of 2 or 3 digits. For PCS 1900 for NA, Federal regulation mandates that a 3-digit MNC shall be used.
   However a network operator may decide to use only two digits in the MNC in the RAI over the radio interface. In
   this case, bits 5 to 8 of octet 3 shall be coded as "1111". Mobile equipment shall accept RAI coded in such a way.

   NOTE 1: In earlier versions of this protocol, the possibility to use a one digit MNC in RAI was provided on the
           radio interface. However as this was not used this possibility has been deleted.

   NOTE 2: In earlier versions of this protocol, bits 5 to 8 of octet 3 were coded as "1111". Mobile equipment
           compliant with these earlier versions of the protocol may be unable to understand the 3-digit MNC
           format of the RAI, and therefore unable to register on a network broadcasting the RAI in this format.

   In abnormal cases, the MNC stored in the mobile station can have:
   - digit 1 or 2 not in the set {0, 1 ... 9}, or
   - digit 3 not in the set {0, 1 ... 9, F} hex.
   In such cases the mobile station shall transmit the stored values using full hexadecimal encoding. When
   receiving such an MNC, the network shall treat the RAI as deleted.

   The same handling shall apply for the network, if a 3-digit MNC is sent by the mobile station to a network using
   only a 2-digit MNC.

   LAC, Location area code (octet 5 and 6)

   In the LAC field bit 8 of octet 5 is the most significant bit and bit 1 of octet 6 the least significant bit.
   The coding of the location area code is the responsibility of each administration except that two values are used
   to mark the LAC, and hence the RAI, as deleted. Coding using full hexadecimal representation may be used. The
   location area code consists of 2 octets.
   If a RAI has to be deleted then all bits of the location area code shall be set to one with the exception of the least
   significant bit which shall be set to zero. If a SIM/USIM is inserted in a Mobile Equipment with the location area
   code containing all zeros, then the Mobile Equipment shall recognise this LAC as part of a deleted RAI.

   RAC, Routing area code (octet 7)

   In the RAC field bit 8 of octet 7 is the most significant. The coding of the routing area code is the responsibility of
   each administration. Coding using full hexadecimal representation may be used. The routing area code consists
   of 1 octet.

                Configuration protocol (octet 3)
                Bits
                321
                0 0 0 PPP for use with IP PDP type or IP PDN type (see 3GPP TS 24.301 [120])


                All other values are interpreted as PPP in this version of the protocol.

                After octet 3, i.e. from octet 4 to octet z, two logical lists are defined:

                -   the Configuration protocol options list (octets 4 to w), and

                -   the Additional parameters list (octets w+1 to z).

                Configuration protocol options list (octets 4 to w)

                The configuration protocol options list contains a variable number of logical units,
                they may occur in an arbitrary order within the configuration protocol options list.

                Each unit is of variable length and consists of a:

                -   protocol identifier (2 octets);
                -   the length of the protocol identifier contents of the unit (1 octet); and
                -   the protocol identifier contents itself (n octets).

                The protocol identifier field contains the hexadecimal coding of the configuration
                protocol identifier. Bit 8 of the first octet of the protocol identifier field contains the
                most significant bit and bit 1 of the second octet of the protocol identifier field
                contains the least significant bit.

                If the configuration protocol options list contains a protocol identifier that is not
                supported by the receiving entity the corresponding unit shall be ignored.

                The length of the protocol identifier contents field contains the binary coded
                representation of the length of the protocol identifier contents field of a unit. The first
                bit in transmission order is the most significant bit.

                The protocol identifier contents field of each unit contains information specific to the
                configuration protocol specified by the protocol identifier.

                At least the following protocol identifiers (as defined in RFC 3232 [103]) shall be
                supported in this version of the protocol:

                -   C021H (LCP);
                -   C023H (PAP);
                -   C223H (CHAP); and
                -   8021H (IPCP).

                The support of other protocol identifiers is implementation dependent and outside
                the scope of the present document.

                The protocol identifier contents field of each unit corresponds to a “Packet” as
                defined in RFC 1661 [102] that is stripped off the “Protocol” and the “Padding”
                octets.

                The detailed coding of the protocol identifier contents field is specified in the RFC
                that is associated with the protocol identifier of that unit.

                Additional parameters list (octets w+1 to z)

                The additional parameters list is included when special parameters and/or requests
                (associated with a PDP context) need to be transferred between the MS and the
                network. These parameters and/or requests are not related to a specific
                configuration protocol (e.g. PPP), and therefore are not encoded as the "Packets"
                contained in the configuration protocol options list.

                The additional parameters list contains a list of special parameters, each one in a
                separate container. The type of the parameter carried in a container is identified by
                a specific container identifier. In this version of the protocol, the following container
                identifiers are specified:

                the QoS rules is specified in 3GPP TS 24.501 [167].

                When the container identifier indicates Session-AMBR, the container identifier
                contents field contains the Session-AMBR for the PDU session corresponding to the
                PDN connection. The Session-AMBR is coded as the value part of Session-AMBR
                information element as specified in subclause 9.11.4.14 of 3GPP TS 24.501 [167].
                The usage of the Session-AMBR is specified in 3GPP TS 24.501 [167].

                When the container identifier indicates PDU session address lifetime, the length of
                container identifier contents indicates a length equal to two. The container identifier
                contents field contains the binary coded representation of how long the network is
                willing to maintain the PDU session in units of seconds. Bit 8 of the first octet of the
                container identifier contents field contains the most significant bit and bit 1 of the
                second octet of the container identifier contents field contains the least significant
                bit. If the length of container identifier contents is different from two octets, then it
                shall be ignored by the receiver.

                When the container identifier indicates QoS flow descriptions, the container identifier
                contents field contains the QoS flow descriptions for the QoS flow corresponding to
                the EPS bearer of the PDN connection. The QoS flow descriptions is coded as the
                value part of QoS flow descriptions information element as specified in
                subclause 9.11.4.12 of 3GPP TS 24.501 [167]. The usage of the QoS flow
                descriptions is specified in 3GPP TS 24.501 [167].

                When the container identifier indicates Ethernet Frame Payload MTU Request, the
                container identifier contents field is empty and the length of container identifier
                contents indicates a length equal to zero. If the container identifier contents field is
                not empty, it shall be ignored. This information indicates that the MS requests link
                MTU for an Ethernet PDU session.

                When the container identifier indicates Ethernet Frame Payload MTU, the length of
                container identifier contents indicates a length equal to two. The container identifier
                contents field contains the binary coded representation of Ethernet frame payload
                MTU size, i.e. the maximum size of a payload of an Ethernet frame which can be
                sent via an Ethernet PDU session in octets. Bit 8 of the first octet of the container
                identifier contents field contains the most significant bit and bit 1 of the second octet
                of the container identifier contents field contains the least significant bit. If the length
                of container identifier contents is different from two octets, then it shall be ignored by
                the receiver.

                When the container identifier indicates Unstructured Link MTU Request, the
                container identifier contents field is empty and the length of container identifier
                contents indicates a length equal to zero. If the container identifier contents field is
                not empty, it shall be ignored. This information indicates that the MS requests link
                MTU for an Unstructured PDU session.

                When the container identifier indicates Unstructured Link MTU, the length of
                container identifier contents indicates a length equal to two. The container identifier
                contents field contains the binary coded representation of unstructured link MTU
                size, i.e. the maximum size of a message which can be sent via an Unstructured
                PDU session in octets. Bit 8 of the first octet of the container identifier contents field
                contains the most significant bit and bit 1 of the second octet of the container
                identifier contents field contains the least significant bit. If the length of container
                identifier contents is different from two octets, then it shall be ignored by the
                receiver.

                When the container identifier indicates 5GSM cause value, the container identifier
                contents field contains a 5GSM cause value. The encoding of the 5GSM cause
                value and its usage are specified in 3GPP TS 24.501 [167].

                When the container identifier indicates QoS rules with the length of two octets
                support indicator, the container identifier contents field is empty and the length of
                container identifier contents indicates a length equal to zero. If the container
                identifier contents field is not empty, it shall be ignored. The length of container
                identifier contents field consists of one octet. This information indicates that the MS
                supports receiving QoS rules with the length of two octets.

                When the container identifier indicates QoS flow descriptions with the length of two
                octets support indicator, the container identifier contents field is empty and the

                 length of container identifier contents indicates a length equal to zero. If the
                 container identifier contents field is not empty, it shall be ignored. The length of
                 container identifier contents field consists of one octet. This information indicates
                 that the MS supports receiving QoS flow descriptions with the length of two octets.

                 When the container identifier indicates QoS rules with the length of two octets, the
                 container identifier contents field contains the QoS rules for the QoS flow
                 corresponding to the EPS bearer of the PDN connection if the MS has indicated the
                 support of receiving QoS rules with the length of two octets. The QoS rules with the
                 length of two octets is coded as the value part of QoS rules information element as
                 specified in subclause 9.11.4.13 of 3GPP TS 24.501 [167]. The usage of the QoS
                 rules is specified in 3GPP TS 24.501 [167]. See NOTE 2.

                 When the container identifier indicates QoS flow descriptions with the length of two
                 octets, the container identifier contents field contains the QoS flow descriptions for
                 the QoS flow corresponding to the EPS bearer of the PDN connection if the MS has
                 indicated the support of receiving QoS flow descriptions with the length of two
                 octets. The QoS flow descriptions with the length of two octets is coded as the value
                 part of QoS flow descriptions information element as specified in
                 subclause 9.11.4.12 of 3GPP TS 24.501 [167]. The usage of the QoS flow
                 descriptions is specified in 3GPP TS 24.501 [167]. See NOTE 2.

                 When the container identifier indicates operator specific use, the Container contents
                 starts with MCC and MNC of the operator providing the relevant application and can
                 be followed by further application specific information. The coding of MCC and MNC
                 is as in octet 2 to 4 of the Location Area Identification information element in
                 subclause 10.5.1.3.

                 NOTE 1: The additional parameters list and the configuration protocol options list
                          are logically separated since they carry different type of information. The
                          beginning of the additional parameters list is marked by a logical unit,
                          which has an identifier (i.e. the first two octets) equal to a container
                          identifier (i.e. it is not a protocol identifier).
                 NOTE 2: If the QoS rules with the length of two octets or the QoS flow descriptions
                          with the length of two octets is included, then extended protocol
                          configuration options as specified in the subclause 10.5.6.3A shall be
                          used.

10.5.6.5          Quality of service
The purpose of the quality of service information element is to specify the QoS parameters for a PDP context.

The QoS IE is defined to allow backward compatibility to earlier version of Session Management Protocol.

The quality of service is a type 4 information element with a minimum length of 14 octets and a maximum length of 18
octets. The QoS requested by the MS shall be encoded both in the QoS attributes specified in octets 3-5 and in the QoS
attributes specified in octets 6-14.

In the MS to network direction and in the network to MS direction the following applies:

   -   Octets 15-22 are optional. If octet 15 is included, then octet 16 shall also be included, and octets 17-22may be
       included.

   -   If octet 17 is included, then octet 18 shall also be included and octets 19-22 may be included.

   -   If octet 19 is included, then octet 20 shall also be included, and octets 21 and 22 may be included.

   -   If octet 21 is included, then octet 22 shall also be included.

   -   A QoS IE received without octets 6-22, without octets 14-22, without octets 15-22, without octets 17-22, without
       octets 19-22 or without octets 21-22 shall be accepted by the receiving entity.

   NOTE:      This behavior is required for interworking with entities supporting an earlier version of the protocol, or
              when the Maximum bit rate for downlink or for downlink and uplink is negotiated to a value lower than
              8700 kbps.

The quality of service information element is coded as shown in figure 10.5.138/3GPP TS 24.008 and
table 10.5.156/3GPP TS 24.008.

10.5.6.12         Traffic Flow Template
The purpose of the traffic flow template information element is to specify the TFT parameters and operations for a PDP
context. In addition, this information element may be used to transfer extra parameters to the network (e.g. the
Authorization Token; see 3GPP TS 24.229 [95]). The TFT may contain packet filters for the downlink direction, the
uplink direction or packet filters that are applicable to both directions. The packet filters determine the traffic mapping
to PDP contexts. The downlink packet filters shall be used by the network and the uplink packet filters shall be used by
the MS. A packet filter that is applicable to both directions shall be used by the network as a downlink packet filter and
by the MS as an uplink packet filter.

The traffic flow template is a type 4 information element with a minimum length of 3 octets. The maximum length for
the IE is 257 octets.

   NOTE 1: The IE length restriction is due to the maximum length that can be encoded in a single length octet.

   NOTE 2: A maximum size IPv4 packet filter can be 32 bytes. Therefore, 7 maximum size IPv4 type packet filters,
           plus the last packet filter which can contain max 30 octets can fit into one TFT IE, i.e. if needed not all
           packet filter components can be defined into one message. A maximum size IPv6 packet filter can be 60
           bytes. Therefore, only 4 maximum size IPv6 packet filters can fit into one TFT IE. However, using "Add
           packet filters to existing TFT", it's possible to create a TFT data structure including 16 maximum size
           IPv4 or IPv6 filters.

The traffic flow template information element is coded as shown in figure 10.5.144/3GPP TS 24.008 and table
10.5.162/3GPP TS 24.008.

   NOTE 3: The 3GPP TS 24.301 [120] reuses the traffic flow template information element for the purpose of the
           traffic flow aggregate description, where the use of individual TFT parameters, e.g. the packet filter
           identifier in the parameter list, can differ from this specification.

                1 1 1 Reserved

                The TFT operation code "No TFT operation" shall be used if a parameters list is
                included but no packet filter list is included in the traffic flow template information
                element.

                The TFT operation code "Ignore this IE" shall be used by the MS if the Traffic flow
                aggregate information element has presence requirement "M" in a message, but the
                information element does not serve any useful purpose in the specific procedure for
                which the message is sent (see 3GPP TS 24.301 [120], subclauses 6.5.3.2 and
                6.5.4.2). If the TFT operation code indicates "Ignore this IE", the MS shall also set
                the E bit and the number of packet filters to zero.

                If the TFT operation code is set to "Ignore this IE" and the the E bit and the number
                of packet filters to zero, then the network shall ignore the contents of the traffic flow
                template information element.

                E bit (bit 5 of octet 3)
                The E bit indicates if a parameters list is included in the TFT IE and it is encoded as
                follows:
                0 parameters list is not included
                1 parameters list is included

                Number of packet filters (octet 3)
                The number of packet filters contains the binary coding for the number of packet
                filters in the packet filter list. The number of packet filters field is encoded in bits 4
                through 1 of octet 3 where bit 4 is the most significant and bit 1 is the least
                significant bit. For the "delete existing TFT" operation and for the "no TFT
                operation", the number of packet filters shall be coded as 0. For all other operations,
                the number of packet filters shall be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 15.

                Packet filter list (octets 4 to z)
                The packet filter list contains a variable number of packet filters. For the "delete
                existing TFT" operation and the "no TFT operation", the packet filter list shall be
                empty.
                For the "delete packet filters from existing TFT" operation, the packet filter list shall
                contain a variable number of packet filter identifiers. This number shall be derived
                from the coding of the number of packet filters field in octet 3.

                For the "create new TFT", "add packet filters to existing TFT" and "replace packet
                filters in existing TFT" operations, the packet filter list shall contain a variable
                number of packet filters. This number shall be derived from the coding of the
                number of packet filters field in octet 3.

                Each packet filter is of variable length and consists of
                - a packet filter identifier and direction (1 octet);
                - a packet filter evaluation precedence (1 octet);
                - the length of the packet filter contents (1 octet); and
                - the packet filter contents itself (v octets).

                The packet filter identifier field is used to identify each packet filter in a TFT. The
                least significant 4 bits are used.

                The packet filter direction is used to indicate, in bits 5 and 6, for what traffic direction
                the filter applies:

                00 - pre Rel-7 TFT filter

                01 - downlink only
                10 - uplink only
                11 - bidirectional
                Bits 8 through 7 are spare bits.

                The packet filter evaluation precedence field is used to specify the precedence for
                the packet filter among all packet filters in all TFTs associated with this PDP
                address. Higher the value of the packet filter evaluation precedence field, lower the
                precedence of that packet filter is. The first bit in transmission order is the most
                significant bit.

                The length of the packet filter contents field contains the binary coded
                representation of the length of the packet filter contents field of a packet filter. The
                first bit in transmission order is the most significant bit.

                The packet filter contents field is of variable size and contains a variable number (at
                least one) of packet filter components. Each packet filter component shall be
                encoded as a sequence of a one octet packet filter component type identifier and a
                fixed length packet filter component value field. The packet filter component type
                identifier shall be transmitted first.

                In each packet filter, there shall not be more than one occurrence of each packet
                filter component type. Among the "IPv4 remote address type" and "IPv6 remote
                address type" packet filter components, only one shall be present in one packet
                filter. Among the "single local port type" and "local port range type" packet filter
                components, only one shall be present in one packet filter. Among the "single
                remote port type" and "remote port range type" packet filter components, only one
                shall be present in one packet filter.

                The term local refers to the MS and the term remote refers to an external network
                entity.

                a packet filter are defined in 3GPP TS 23.060 [74] subclause 15.3.2.

                For "IPv4 remote address type", the packet filter component value field shall be
                encoded as a sequence of a four octet IPv4 address field and a four octet IPv4
                address mask field. The IPv4 address field shall be transmitted first.

                For "IPv4 local address type", the packet filter component value field shall be
                encoded as defined for "IPv4 remote address type".
                Both the MS and network indication for support of the Local address in TFTs are
                required to use this packet filter component.

                For "IPv6 remote address type", the packet filter component value field shall be
                encoded as a sequence of a sixteen octet IPv6 address field and a sixteen octet
                IPv6 address mask field. The IPv6 address field shall be transmitted first.

                For "IPv6 remote address/prefix length type", the packet filter component value field
                shall be encoded as a sequence of a sixteen octet IPv6 address field and one octet

                prefix length field. The IPv6 address field shall be transmitted first.
                This parameter shall be used, instead of IPv6 remote address type, when both the
                MS and network indication for support of the Local address in TFT are present.

                For "IPv6 local address/prefix length type", the packet filter component value field
                shall be encoded as defined for "IPv6 remote address /prefix length".
                Both the MS and network indication for support of the Local address in TFTs are
                required to use this packet filter component.

                NOTE:      Local IP address and mask can be used when IPv6 prefix delegation is
                           used (see 3GPP TS 23.060 [74] subclause 9.2.1.2).

                For "Protocol identifier/Next header type", the packet filter component value field
                shall be encoded as one octet which specifies the IPv4 protocol identifier or IPv6
                next header.

                For "Single local port type" and "Single remote port type", the packet filter
                component value field shall be encoded as two octet which specifies a port number.

                For "Local port range type" and "Remote port range type", the packet filter
                component value field shall be encoded as a sequence of a two octet port range low
                limit field and a two octet port range high limit field. The port range low limit field
                shall be transmitted first.

                For "Security parameter index", the packet filter component value field shall be
                encoded as four octet which specifies the IPSec security parameter index.

                For "Type of service/Traffic class type", the packet filter component value field shall
                be encoded as a sequence of a one octet Type-of-Service/Traffic Class field and a
                one octet Type-of-Service/Traffic Class mask field. The Type-of-Service/Traffic
                Class field shall be transmitted first.

                For "Flow label type", the packet filter component value field shall be encoded as
                three octet which specifies the IPv6 flow label. The bits 8 through 5 of the first octet
                shall be spare whereas the remaining 20 bits shall contain the IPv6 flow label.
                Parameters list (octets z+1 to v)

                The parameters list contains a variable number of parameters that may be
                transferred. If the parameters list is included, the E bit is set to 1; otherwise, the E bit
                is set to 0.

                Each parameter included in the parameters list is of variable length and consists of:
                - a parameter identifier (1 octet);
                - the length of the parameter contents (1 octet); and
                - the parameter contents itself (v octets).

                The parameter identifier field is used to identify each parameter included in the
                parameters list and it contains the hexadecimal coding of the parameter identifier.
                Bit 8 of the parameter identifier field contains the most significant bit and bit 1
                contains the least significant bit. In this version of the protocol, the following
                parameter identifiers are specified:
                - 01H (Authorization Token);
                - 02H (Flow Identifier); and
                - 03H (Packet Filter Identifier).

                If the parameters list contains a parameter identifier that is not supported by the
                receiving entity the corresponding parameter shall be discarded.
                The length of parameter contents field contains the binary coded representation of
                the length of the parameter contents field. The first bit in transmission order is the
                most significant bit.

                When the parameter identifier indicates Authorization Token, the parameter
                contents field contains an authorization token, as specified in 3GPP TS 29.207
                [100]. The first octet is the most significant octet of the authorization token and the
                last octet is the least significant octet of the authorization token.
                The parameters list shall be coded in a way that an Authorization Token (i.e. a
                parameter with identifier 01H) is always followed by one or more Flow Identifiers
                (i.e. one or more parameters with identifier 02H).

                  If the parameters list contains two or more consecutive Authorization Tokens without
                  any Flow Identifiers in between, the receiver shall treat this as a semantical TFT
                  error.

                  When the parameter identifier indicates Flow Identifier, the parameter contents field
                  contains the binary representation of a flow identifier. The Flow Identifier consists of
                  four octets. Octets 1 and 2 contains the Media Component number as specified in
                  3GPP TS 29.207 [100]. Bit 1 of octet 2 is the least significant bit, and bit 8 of octet 1
                  is the most significant bit. Octets 3 and 4 contains the IP flow number as specified in
                  3GPP TS 29.207 [100]. Bit 1 of octet 4 is the least significant bit, and bit 8 of octet 3
                  is the most significant bit.

                  When the parameter identifier indicates Packet Filter Identifier, the parameter
                  contents field contains the binary representation of one or more packet filter
                  identifiers. Each packet filter identifier is encoded in one octet, in the 4 least
                  significant bits. This parameter is used by the MS and the network to identify one or
                  more packet filters in a TFT when modifying the QoS of a PDP context without
                  modifying the packet filter itself.

10.5.6.14         MBMS bearer capabilities
The purpose of the MBMS bearer capabilities information element is to indicate the maximum bit rate for downlink
supported by the MS for an MBMS context.

   NOTE:      The information element indicates the static physical capabilities of the MS, independent of the radio
              access (UTRAN or GERAN), the radio conditions, or other CS or PS services possibly activated by the
              MS.

The MBMS bearer capabilities is a type 4 information element with a maximum length of 4 octets.

Maximum bit rate for downlink, octet 3 (see 3GPP TS 23.107 [81])

The coding is identical to that of the maximum bit rate for downlink, octet 9, in the Quality of service information element
(see subclause 10.5.6.5).

If the sending entity wants to indicate a maximum bit rate for downlink higher than 8640 kbps, it shall set octet 3 to
”11111110”, i.e. 8640 kbps, and shall encode the value for the maximum bit rate in octet 4.

Maximum bit rate for downlink (extended), octet 4

The coding is identical to that of the maximum bit rate for downlink (extended), octet 15, in the Quality of service
information element (see subclause 10.5.6.5).



10.5.6.15         MBMS protocol configuration options
The purpose of the MBMS protocol configuration options information element is to:

   -   transfer protocol options associated with the bearer level of an MBMS context activation, and

   -   transfer additional MBMS bearer related (protocol) data (e.g. configuration parameters, error codes or
       messages/events).

The MBMS protocol configuration options is a type 4 information element with a minimum length of 3 octets and a
maximum length of 253 octets.

The MBMS protocol configuration options information element is coded as shown in figure 10.5.156/3GPP TS 24.008
and table 10.5.170/3GPP TS 24.008.

                  GPRS Timer 3 value (octet 3)

                  Bits 5 to 1 represent the binary coded timer value.

                  Bits 6 to 8 defines the timer value unit for the GPRS timer as follows:
                  Bits
                  876
                  0 0 0 value is incremented in multiples of 10 minutes
                  0 0 1 value is incremented in multiples of 1 hour
                  0 1 0 value is incremented in multiples of 10 hours
                  0 1 1 value is incremented in multiples of 2 seconds
                  1 0 0 value is incremented in multiples of 30 seconds
                  1 0 1 value is incremented in multiples of 1 minute
                  1 1 0 value is incremented in multiples of 320 hours (NOTE 1)
                  1 1 1 value indicates that the timer is deactivated (NOTE 2).

                  NOTE 1: This timer value unit is only applicable to the T3312 extended value IE
                          and the T3412 extended value IE (see 3GPP TS 24.301 [120]). If the UE
                          receives the IE in an integrity protected message, then it shall interpret
                          the value as multiples of 320 hours. Otherwise it shall interpret the value
                          as multiples of 1 hour.
                          If the network receives the IE in S1 mode, the network shall interpret the
                          value as multiples of 320 hours, regardless whether the IE is received in
                          an integrity protected message (e.g., an ATTACH REQUEST message or
                          TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message (see
                          3GPP TS 24.301 [120])) or not. Otherwise it shall interpret the value as
                          multiples of 1 hour.

                  NOTE 2: This timer value unit is not applicable to the T3412 extended value IE. If
                          this timer value is received, the T3412 extended value IE shall be
                          considered as not included in the message (see 3GPP TS 24.301 [120]).



10.5.7.5      Radio priority 2
The purpose of the radio priority 2 information element is to specify the priority level that the MS shall use at the lower

NOTE 1:    The timeout value is broadcasted in a SYSTEM INFORMATION message or received in a LOCATION
           UPDATING ACCEPT message.
NOTE 2:    The MS starts the timer with a random value, uniformly drawn from the range between 12h and 24h.
NOTE 3:    The timer value is provided by the network in a LOCATION UPDATING REJECT or a CM SERVICE
           REJECT message or as an "Extended wait time" value by the lower layers, or chosen randomly from a
           default value range of 15 – 30 minutes.
NOTE 4:    The MS starts the timer with a random value, uniformly drawn from the range between 30 minutes and 60
           minutes.
NOTE 5:    If the timer is started by an eCall only MS capable of eCall over IMS due to performing intersystem change
           from S1 mode to Iu or A/Gb mode while timer T3444 (see 3GPP TS 24.301 [120]) is running, the MS starts
           the timer with a value set to the time left on timer T3444. Otherwise the MS starts the timer with a value set
           to 12 hours.
NOTE 6:    If the timer is started by an eCall only MS capable of eCall over IMS due to performing intersystem change
           from S1 mode to Iu or A/Gb mode while timer T3445 (see 3GPP TS 24.301 [120]) is running, the MS starts
           the timer with a value set to the time left on timer T3445. Otherwise the MS starts the timer with a value set
           to 12 hours.

11.2.1        Timer T3240 and Timer T3241
Timer T3240 is started in the mobile station when:

   -   the mobile station receives a LOCATION UPDATING ACCEPT message completing a location updating
       procedure in the cases specified in subclauses 4.4.4.6 and 4.4.4.8;

   -   the mobile station receives a LOCATION UPDATING REJECT message in the cases specified in
       subclause 4.4.4.7;

   -   the mobile station has sent a CM SERVICE ABORT message as specified in subclause 4.5.1.7;

   -   the mobile station has released or aborted all MM connections in the cases specified in 4.3.2.5, 4.3.5.2, 4.5.1.1,
       and 4.5.3.1;

   -   the mobile station receives the paging message from network and enter the MM state 9 (WAIT FOR
       NETWORK COMMAND).

Timer T3240 is stopped, reset, and started again at receipt of an MM message.

Timer T3240 is stopped and reset (but not started) at receipt of a CM message that initiates establishment of an CM
connection (an appropriate SETUP, REGISTER, or CP-DATA message as defined in 3GPP TS 24.008, 3GPP TS
24.010 [21] or 3GPP TS 24.011 [22]).

If timer T3240 expires, the MS shall abort the RR connection and enter the MM state MM IDLE.

Timer T3241 is started in the mobile station when entering MM state RR CONNECTION RELEASE NOT
ALLOWED.

Timer T3241 is stopped and reset (but not started) when the MM state RR CONNECTION RELEASE NOT
ALLOWED is left.

If timer T3241 expires, the MS shall abort the RR connection and enter the MM state MM IDLE.

NOTE 1: The default value of this timer is used if the network does not indicate another value in a GMM signalling
         procedure.
NOTE 2: The default value of this timer is used if neither the MS nor the Network send another value, or if the Network
         sends this value, in a signalling procedure.
NOTE 3: Typically, the procedures are aborted on the fifth expiry of the relevant timer. Exceptions are described in the
         corresponding procedure description.
NOTE 4: The purpose of this timer is to prevent the MS from repeating the SERVICE REQUEST message with service
         type "data" too early in case the request to setup the radio access bearer is queued by the radio access
         network.
NOTE 5: The cases in which the default value of this timer is used are described in subclause 4.7.2.7.
NOTE 6: The value of this timer may be provided by the network to the MS in the ATTACH ACCEPT message and
         ROUTING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message. The default value of this timer is identical to the value of
         timer T3312.
NOTE 7: The timer value is provided by the network in an ATTACH REJECT, ROUTING AREA UPDATE REJECT,
         TRACKING AREA UPDATE REJECT or SERVICE REJECT message or as a "Extended wait time" value by
         the lower layers, or chosen randomly from a default value range of 15 – 30 minutes. In this release, receipt of
         the "Extended wait time" as part of 5GMM from the lower layers is not defined.
NOTE 8: The cases in which the default value of this timer is used are described in subclause 4.7.2.2.
NOTE 9: The timer value is provided by the network in an ATTACH ACCEPT, ROUTING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT or
         TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message.
NOTE 10: The value of this timer is UE implementation specific, with a minimum value of 60 seconds.

NOTE 1: The value of this timer is network dependent.
NOTE 2: The default value of this timer is used if neither the MS nor the Network send another value, or if the Network
        sends this value, in a signalling procedure. The value of this timer should be slightly shorter in the network
        than in the MS, this is a network implementation issue.
NOTE 3: Typically, the procedures are aborted on the fifth expiry of the relevant timer. Exceptions are described in the
        corresponding procedure description.
NOTE 4: The default value of this timer is 4 minutes greater than T3312. If T3346 is larger than T3312 and the SGSN
        includes timer T3346 in the ROUTING AREA UPDATE REJECT message or the SERVICE REJECT
        message, the value of the mobile reachable timer and implicit detach timer is set such that the sum of the
        timer values is greater than T3346. If the MS is attached for emergency bearer services, the value of this
        timer is set equal to T3312.
NOTE 5: The value of this timer is network dependent. If ISR is activated, the default value of this timer is 4 minutes
        greater than T3323.
NOTE 6: If the network includes timer T3324 in the ATTACH ACCEPT message or ROUTING AREA UPDATE
        ACCEPT message and if the MS is not attached for emergency bearer services and has no PDN connection
        for emergency bearer services, the value of this timer is equal to the value of timer T3324.
NOTE 7: The value of this timer is smaller than the value of timer T3-RESPONSE (see 3GPP TS 29.274 [16D]).
NOTE 8: If the SGSN supports EC-GSM-IoT and if the MS is using EC-GSM-IoT, the timer value is calculated as
        described in subclause 4.7.2.12.
NOTE 9: If the SGSN supports EC-GSM-IoT and if the MS is using EC-GSM-IoT, then the timer value shall be
        calculated by using a multiplier which value is network dependent.

                                           timer value as specified in
                                           3GPP TS 24.301 [120]
NOTE 1: The value of this timer or the value of this timer unit can be provided by the network operator when:
              -   a request to activate a PDP context, a request to activate a MBMS context or a request to modify a
                  PDP context is rejected by the network with a certain SM cause;

              -   a request to deactivate a PDP context is received with a certain SM cause value;

              -   a request to establish a PDN connection, a request to allocate bearer resources or a request to modify
                  bearer resources (defined in 3GPP TS 24.301 [120]) is rejected by the network with a certain ESM
                  cause;

              -   a request to deactivate a EPS bearer context is received with a certain ESM cause value;

              -   a request to establish a PDU session or a request to modify a PDU session (defined in
                  3GPP TS 24.501 [167]) is rejected by the network:

                  1) with a certain 5GSM cause; or

                  2) indication that the 5GSM message was not forwarded due to DNN based congestion control; or

              -   a command to release a PDU session is received with a certain 5GSM cause value.
        If the timer unit is not set to indicate that the timer is deactivated, the value of the timer when included with
        SM cause, ESM cause, 5GSM cause #26, or due to DNN based congestion control is zero or the timer value
        is taken randomly from an operator dependent range not greater than 70 hours. If the PDN CONNECTIVITY
        REJECT was sent together with an ATTACH REJECT message and the ATTACH REJECT message was not
        integrity protected, MS uses a random value from a default range of 10mins to 30mins.
NOTE 2: The default value of 12 minutes applies only for certain (E) SM cause values as specified in
        subclauses 6.1.3.1.3.3, 6.1.3.2.2.3, and 6.1.3.3.3.3, in 3GPP TS 24.301 [120].
NOTE 3: If the MS is using EC-GSM-IoT, the timer value shall be calculated as described in subclause 4.7.2.12.

   NOTE 1: Typically, the procedures are aborted on the fifth expiry of the relevant timer. Exceptions are described in
           the corresponding procedure description.

   NOTE 2: The back-off timer is used to describe a logical model of the required MS behaviour. This model does not
           imply any specific implementation, e.g. as a timer or timestamp.

   NOTE 3: Reference to back-off timer in this section can either refer to use of timer T3396 or to use of a different
           packet system specific timer within the MS. Whether the MS uses T3396 as a back-off timer or it uses
           different packet system specific timers as back-off timers is left up to MS implementation.

   NOTE 1: The network may already have applied an internal alerting supervision function; e.g. incorporated within
           call control. If such a function is known to be operating on the call, then timer T301 is not used.

   NOTE 2: These time values are set by the network operator.

   NOTE 3: When applied to the supplementary service CCBS, the timer T334 can either represent the recall timer T4
           or the notification timer T10 (see 3GPP TS 23.093 [88a]). Thus the timer T334 can take two different
           values. 3GPP TS 23.093 [88a] defines the range of these values.

Annex B (normative):
Compatibility checking

B.1           Introduction
This annex describes the various compatibility checks which shall be carried out to ensure that the best matched MS and
network capabilities are achieved on a call between a PLMN and the ISDN.

Three different processes of compatibility checking shall be performed:

   i) at the user-to-network interface on the calling side (see B.2);

   ii) at the network-user interface on the called side (see B.3.2);

   iii) user-to-user (see B 3.3).

   NOTE:      In this context and throughout this annex the term "called user" is the end point entity which is explicitly
              addressed.

For details on the coding of the information required for compatibility checking, see annex C.



B.2           Calling side compatibility checking

B.2.1         Compatibility checking of the CM SERVICE REQUEST
              message
The network shall check if the service requested in the CM SERVICE REQUEST message is permitted for that
subscriber.


B.2.2         Compatibility/Subscription checking of the SETUP message
At the calling side the network shall check that the basic service(s) requested by the calling MS in the Bearer Capability
information element(s) match(es) with the basic services provided to that subscriber by the PLMN. If for at least one
bearer capability information element contained in the SETUP message a mismatch is detected, then the network shall
proceed as follows:

   -   if the SETUP message contained two bearer capability information elements for only one of which a mismatch is
       detected, the network shall either:

       -   under the conditions specified in 3GPP TS 27.001 [36] (e.g. TS 61 and TS 62), accept the SETUP message
           with a CALL PROCEEDING message containing the, possibly negotiated, bearer capability information
           element for which no mismatch is detected, or

       -   reject the call using one of the causes listed in annex H.

   -   otherwise the network shall reject the call using one of the causes listed in annex H.

Network services are described in 3GPP TS 22.002 [3] and 3GPP TS 22.003 [4] as bearer services and teleservices,
respectively.



B.3           Called side compatibility checking
In this clause, the word "check" means that the MS examines the contents of the specified information element.

B.3.1         Compatibility checking with addressing information
If an incoming SETUP message is offered to the MS with addressing information (i.e. sub-address or called party
number) the following shall occur:

   a) if the MS has a DDI number or a sub-address, then the information in any Called Party BCD Number or any
      Called Party subaddress information elements of the incoming SETUP message shall be checked by the MS
      against the corresponding part of the number assigned to the user (e.g. for DDI) or the user's own sub-address.

       In the cases of a mismatch, the MS shall release the call. In the case of a match, the compatibility checking
       described in B.3.2 and B.3.3 shall be performed.

   b) if the MS has no DDI number and no sub-address, then the Called Party BCD Number and Called Party Sub-
      address information element shall be ignored for the purposes of compatibility checking. The compatibility
      checking described in B.3.2 and B.3.3 shall be performed.

   NOTE:      According to the user's requirements, compatibility checking can be performed in various ways from the
              viewpoint of execution order and information to be checked, e.g. first DDI number/sub-address and then
              bearer capability or vice versa.


B.3.2         Network-to-MS compatibility checking
When the network is providing a basic service at the called side, the MS shall check that the basic service(s) offered by
the network in the Bearer Capability information element(s) match(es) the basic services that the MS is able to support.
If a mismatch is detected, then the MS shall proceed as follows:

   -   if the SETUP message contained two bearer capability information elements for only one of which a mismatch is
       detected, the MS shall either:

       -   under the conditions specified in 3GPP TS 27.001 [36] (e.g. TS 61 and TS 62), accept the SETUP message
           with a CALL CONFIRMED message containing the, possibly negotiated, bearer capability information
           element for which no mismatch is detected, or

       -   reject the call using cause No. 88 "incompatible destination".

   -   otherwise the MS shall reject the offered call using a RELEASE COMPLETE message with cause No. 88
       "incompatible destination".

   NOTE:      The backup bearer capability IE is not subject to compatibility checking.

When interworking with existing networks, limitations in network or distant user signalling (e.g. in the case of an
incoming call from a PSTN or a call from an analogue terminal) may restrict the information available to the called MS
in the incoming SETUP message (e.g. missing Bearer Capability Information Element or missing High Layer
Compatibility Information Element). For compatibility checking, and handling of such calls see 3GPP TS 27.001 [36].


B.3.3         User-to-User compatibility checking
See 3GPP TS 27.001 [36].



B.4           High layer compatibility checking
See 3GPP TS 27.001 [36].

Annex C (normative):
Low layer information coding principles

C.1           Purpose
This annex describes principles that shall be used when the calling MS specifies information during call setup regarding
low layer capabilities required in the network and by the destination terminal. Refer also to 3GPP TS 27.001 [36].

   NOTE:      In this context and throughout this annex the term "called user" is the end point entity which is explicitly
              addressed. This may also be an explicitly addressed interworking unit (IWU) (see ITU-T I.500-Series
              Recommendations and ITU-T Recommendation X.31 case a).



C.2           Principles

C.2.1         Definition of types of information
There are three different types of information that the calling PLMN user may specify during call setup to identify low
layer capabilities needed in the network and in the destination terminal:

   a) type I information is information about the calling terminal which is only used at the destination end to allow a
      decision regarding terminal compatibility. An example would be the user information layer 3 protocol. Type I
      information is encoded in octets 5 to 7 of the low layer compatibility information element;

   b) type II information is only used by the network (PLMN) to which the calling user is connected for selection of
      PLMN specific network resources, e.g. channel type or specific functionality within the interworking function
      (IWF, see 3GPP TS 23.093 [88a]). This type of information is always present. An example is the connection
      element. Type II information is coded in:

       i) octet 3 of the bearer capability information element when the information transfer capability required by the
          calling user is speech ;

       ii) octets 3, 4, 5, and optionally octet 7 of the bearer capability information element when the information
           transfer capability required by the calling user is not speech;

   c) type III information is required for selection of a basic service from the choice of basic services offered by the
      network and together with type II information for selection of an appropriate interworking function (IWF, see
      3GPP TS 29.007 [38]), as well as for terminal compatibility checking at the destination terminal. An example is
      the information transfer capability. Type III information is always present and is encoded in:

       i) octet 3 of the bearer capability information element when the information transfer capability required by the
          calling user is speech ;

       ii) octets 3, 5, 6, 6a, 6b and 6c of the bearer capability information element when the information transfer
           capability required by the calling user is not speech;


C.2.2         Examination by network
Type I information is user-to-user (i.e. at the calling side not examined by network) while type II and III information
should be available for examination by the destination user and the network.

   NOTE:      In the case of a mobile terminated call, if the type II and type III information is not sufficient for the
              selection of an appropriate interworking function, the type I information will also examined by the
              network.

C.2.3         Location of type I information
Type I information (i.e. terminal information only significant to the called user) shall, when used, be included in the low
layer compatibility information element.


C.2.4         Location of types II and III information
Type II information is included in the bearer capability information element. Type III information is also included in the
bearer capability information element. The network may use and modify type III information (e.g. to provide
interworking).

In any case a modification of the bearer capability information element has to be performed when interworking to the
fixed network (e.g. ISDN) is required, where the signalling of the radio interface has to be mapped to fixed network
signalling (e.g. mapping of GSM BCIE to ISDN BCIE, see 3GPP TS 29.007 [38]).


C.2.5         Relationship between bearer capability and low layer
              compatibility information elements
There shall be no contradiction of information between the low layer compatibility and the bearer capability at the
originating side. However, as some bearer capability code points may be modified during the transport of the call (e.g.
by the interworking function), this principle implies that there should be minimal duplication of information between
the bearer capability information element and the low layer compatibility information element.

   NOTE:      If as a result of duplication, a contradiction occurs at the terminating side between the bearer capability
              information element and the low layer compatibility information element at the terminating side, the
              receiving entity shall ignore the conflicting information in the low layer compatibility information
              element.

Annex E (informative):
Comparison between call control procedures specified in
3GPP TS 24.008 and ITU-T Recommendation Q.931
This annex summarizes a comparison of the procedures for call control as specified in ITU-T Recommendation Q.931
(blue book) and 3GPP TS 24.008.

If no comment is given, it means that the procedures specified in ITU-T Recommendation Q.931 and 3GPP TS 24.008
are similar. However, it should be noted that even in such cases the procedures may be described in slightly different
ways in the two documents.

Annex G (informative):
3GPP specific cause values for mobility management
This annex describes the cause values for the mobility management procedures for non-GPRS services (MM) and
GPRS services (GMM). Clauses G1 to G5 are valid for both MM and GMM. However, the following codes are
applicable for non-GPRS services only:

      #38 Call cannot be identified

Clause G.6 applies only for GMM procedures.



G.1          Causes related to MS identification
Cause value = 2 IMSI unknown in HLR

      This cause is sent to the MS if the MS is not known (registered) in the HLR, or if the MS has packet only
      subscription (see 3GPP TS 29.272 [150]). This cause code does not affect operation of the GPRS service,
      although is may be used by a GMM procedure.

Cause value = 3 Illegal MS

      This cause is sent to the MS when the network refuses service to the MS either because an identity of the MS is
      not acceptable to the network or because the MS does not pass the authentication check, i.e. the SRES received
      from the MS is different from that generated by the network. When used by an MM procedure, except the
      authentication procedure, this cause does not affect operation of the GPRS service.

Cause value = 4 IMSI unknown in VLR

      This cause is sent to the MS when the given IMSI is not known at the VLR.

Cause value = 5 IMEI not accepted

      This cause is sent to the MS if the network does not accept emergency call establishment using an IMEI or not
      accept attach procedure for emergency services using an IMEI.

Cause value = 6 Illegal ME

      This cause is sent to the MS if the ME used is not acceptable to the network, e.g. blacklisted. When used by an
      MM procedure, this cause does not affect operation of the GPRS service.



G.2          Cause related to subscription options
Cause value = 11 PLMN not allowed

      This cause is sent to the MS if it requests service, or if the network initiates a detach request, in a PLMN where
      the MS, by subscription or due to operator determined barring is not allowed to operate.

Cause value = 12 Location Area not allowed

      This cause is sent to the MS if it requests service, or if the network initiates a detach request, in a location area
      where the HPLMN determines that the MS, by subscription, is not allowed to operate.

   NOTE 1: If cause #12 is sent to a roaming subscriber the subscriber is denied service even if other PLMNs are
           available on which registration was possible.

Cause value = 13 Roaming not allowed in this location area

This cause indicates the channel most recently identified is not acceptable to the sending entity for use in this call.


H.1.4         Cause No. 8 "operator determined barring"
This cause indicates that the MS has tried to access a service that the MS's network operator or service provider is not
prepared to allow.


H.1.4a Cause No. 13 "call completed elsewhere"
This cause indicates that the call is being cleared by the network towards the present device because the called user has
responded to the call on another device. This cause only applies when the MSC/VLR is an MSC server enhanced for
ICS as specified in 3GPP TS 24.292 [163] and performs interworking with SIP as specified in 3GPP TS 29.292 [164].


H.1.5         Cause No.16 "normal call clearing"
This cause indicates that the call is being cleared because one of the users involved in the call has requested that the call
be cleared.

Under normal situations, the source of this cause is not the network.


H.1.6         Cause No.17 "user busy"
This cause is used when the called user has indicated the inability to accept another call.

prescribed period of time.


H.1.9         Cause No. 21 "call rejected"
       This cause indicates that the equipment sending this cause does not wish to accept this call, although it could
       have accepted the call because the equipment sending this cause is neither busy nor incompatible.


H.1.10 Cause No. 22 "number changed"
This cause is returned to a calling mobile station when the called party number indicated by the calling mobile station is
no longer assigned. The new called party number may optionally be included in the diagnostic field. If a network does
not support this capability, cause No. 1 "unassigned (unallocated) number" shall be used.


H.1.10a Cause No. 24 "call rejected due to feature at the
       destination"
This cause is returned when the call is rejected due to a feature at the destination, e.g. Anonymous Call Rejection. This
cause is only generated by the network. This cause is not generated by the MS.

Not supported. Treated as cause no. 31.


H.1.13 Cause No. 27 "destination out of order"
This cause indicates that the destination indicated by the mobile station cannot be reached because the interface to the
destination is not functioning correctly. The term "not functioning correctly" indicates that a signalling message was
unable to be delivered to the remote user; e.g., a physical layer or data link layer failure at the remote user, user
equipment off-line, etc.


H.1.14 Cause No. 28 "invalid number format (incomplete number)"
This cause indicates that the called user cannot be reached because the called party number is not a valid format or is

Annex M (normative):
Additional Requirements for backward compatibility with
PCS 1900 for NA revision 0 ME
This annex provides additional requirements to support network mechanisms for backward compatibility with PCS
1900 for NA revision 0 mobile equipments (applicable until July 1, 1998).

PCS 1900 for NA revision 0 mobile equipments are defined to understand Mobile Network Codes made of up to 2
digits. However federal regulation mandates that a 3-digit MNC shall be allocated by each administration to network
operators. Therefore each network operator is identified by a 3-digit Mobile Country Code and a 3-digit Mobile
Network Code. An operator whose network code complies to the allocation principle specified for PCS 1900 for NA
and wants to achieve for a transition period of time the backward compatibility with PCS 1900 for NA revision 0
mobile equipments shall apply the following:

   -   The network shall send over the air interface the 3-digit Mobile Country Code and only the two most significant
       digits of the Mobile Network Code (the value of the "digit" sent instead of the 3rd digit is specified in 3GPP TS
       24.008, subclause 10.5.1.3) (see note).

When a PCS 1900 for NA (revision greater than 0) mobile equipment recognizes over the air the Mobile Country Code
and the two most significant digits of the Mobile Network Code as being the HPLMN codes of the current IMSI, the
mobile equipment shall take into account the value of the sixth IMSI digit read from the SIM/USIM. If this value
matches to a value contained in the limited set of values for the least significant MNC digit assigned by the number
administration bodies for PCS 1900 for NA then the following applies for the mobile equipment:

   -   The value sent over the air instead of the 3rd MNC digit in the Location Area Identification (for coding see 3GPP
       TS 24.008, subclause 10.5.1.3) shall be interpreted as the value of the sixth IMSI digit read from the SIM/USIM.

   NOTE:      It is still a network operator option to apply this requirement after July 1, 1998. However, in this case the
              following shall be considered:

              1. Network selection considerations for overlapping networks:

              -   Networks overlapping to the HPLMN, identified over the radio interface by an identical combination
                  MCC1 MCC2 MCC3 MNC1 MNC2 (possible after July 1, 1998) may be selectable by PCS 1900 for
                  NA mobile equipments revision 0 with the same priority as the HPLMN or presented to the user as the
                  HPLMN.

              2 Roaming considerations:

              -   Roamers (SIM/USIM) from networks identified by an identical combination MCC1 MCC2 MCC3
                  MNC1 MNC2 (possible after July 1, 1998) when roaming into the operator network with PCS 1900
                  for NA mobile equipments revision 0, may cause these equipments to exhibit an unpredictable
                  behaviour (e.g. looping in the HPLMN selection and registration procedures).

              -   Home subscribers (SIM/USIM) roaming with PCS 1900 for NA mobile equipments revision 0 into
                  networks identified by an identical combination MCC1 MCC2 MCC3 MNC1 MNC2 (possible after
                  July 1, 1998), may consider being attached to the HPLMN.

Annex N (normative):
Ranking of reject causes for Location Registration (MM and
GMM) in a shared network
This annex describes how the reject cause is determined:

   -   for a network sharing non-supporting MS in a shared network with multi-operator core network (MOCN)
       configuration; or

   -   for any MS in a multi-operator core network (MOCN) with common GERAN,

when a location registration request from the MS is redirected among CN operators via the shared RAN (see 3GPP TS
23.251 [109]) and is rejected by all core networks. In the following, the term 'location registration' is used for location
area updating, GPRS attach, combined GPRS attach, routing area updating, and combined routing area updating.

   i) If the location registration request was either:

       1) accepted;

       2) rejected with a reject cause different from #11, #12, #13, #14, #15, #17, and #25; or

       3) rejected with a reject cause #17 when the MSC or the SGSN received an error not indicating "system
          failure", "data missing" or "unexpected data value" from the HLR (see 3GPP TS 29.002 [37] and
          3GPP TS 29.010 [152]),

   then one of the following actions is taken:

       -   in UTRAN Iu mode, the MSC or SGSN shall include the redirection completed information element in the
           RANAP DIRECT TRANSFER message transmitting the location registration accept message or location
           registration reject message to the RNC. According to 3GPP TS 25.413 [19c], the RNC will then forward the
           location registration accept message or the location registration reject message to the MS.

       -   in A/Gb mode, the MSC shall use DTAP message and SGSN shall use BSSGP DL-UNIDATA message to
           carry the location registration accept message or location registration reject message to the BSC. According
           to 3GPP TS 48.008 [85] and 3GPP TS 48.018 [86], the BSC will then forward the location registration accept
           message or location registration reject message to the MS.

   ii) If the location registration request was either:

       1) rejected with one of the reject causes #11, #12, #13, #14, #15, and #25; or

       2) rejected with a reject cause #17 when the MSC or the SGSN received an error indicating "system failure",
          "data missing" or "unexpected data value" from the HLR (see 3GPP TS 29.002 [37] and
          3GPP TS 29.010 [152]),

   then one of the following actions is taken:

       -   in UTRAN Iu mode, the MSC or SGSN shall include a redirection indication in the RANAP DIRECT
           TRANSFER message transmitting the location registration reject message to the RNC. According to 3GPP
           TS 25.413 [19c], the RNC will then initiate the redirection procedure towards the next CN operator and treat
           the response from the core network according to (i) and (ii).

       -    in A/Gb mode, the MSC shall use BSSMAP Reroute Command message and SGSN shall use BSSGP DL-
            UNIDATA message to transmit the location registration reject message to the BSC with a redirection
            indication. According to 3GPP TS 48.008 [85] and 3GPP TS 48.018 [86], the BSC will then initiate the
            redirection procedure towards the next CN operator and treat the response from the core network according
            to (i), (ii) and (iii).

   iii) If the location registration request was rejected including a redirection indication and with one of the reject
        causes #11, #12, #13, #14, #15, #17, and #25 by all CN operators taking part in a shared network, the RNC for
        UTRAN Iu mode or the BSC for A/Gb mode shall determine the reject cause with the highest rank from the
        received reject causes and send a location registration reject message containing this reject cause to the MS.

      The ranking of the reject causes, from the lowest rank to the highest rank, is given by:

          #11 < #12 < #13 < #14 < #15 < #25 < #17.

   iv) If the location registration request was rejected with one of the reject causes #11, #12, #13, #14, and #15 by all
       CN operators taking part in a shared network in a specific location area, but there is at least one additional CN
       operator taking part in a shared network in another location area of the shared network defined by the same
       common PLMN identity, the RNC for UTRAN Iu mode or the BSC for A/Gb mode shall send a location
       registration reject message with the reject cause #15 to the MS.

Annex O (normative):
3GPP capability exchange protocol


O.1           Scope
This annex specifies the protocol data units used by the 3GPP capability exchange protocol and procedures for the
handling of unknown, unforeseen, and erroneous protocol data by the receiving MS.

The 3GPP capability exchange protocol provides services for the end-to-end exchange of capabilities between MSs. It is
a separate protocol which uses the user-to-user signalling service 1 of the layer 3 call control protocol as a means of
transport.

Functional procedures which use the 3GPP capability exchange protocol in the context of CSI are specified in
3GPP TS 24.279 [116].



O.2           User-user protocol contents
The user-user protocol contents is included in the user-user information element described in subclause 10.5.4.25.

The user-user protocol contents is structured like the non-imperative part of a standard L3 message (see
3GPP TS 24.007 [20], subclause 11.2) and is composed of a variable number of information elements of type 1, 2, 3
and 4. The different formats (TV, TLV) and the categories of information elements (type 1, 2, 3 and 4) are defined in
3GPP TS 24.007 [20].

Within the user-user protocol contents the information elements may occur in an arbitrary order.

All information elements shall be included only once.

O.4            Information elements

O.4.1          Personal ME identifier
The purpose of the personal ME identifier is to discriminate between MEs used by the same user (see TS 24.279 [116],
subclause 4.2).

   NOTE:       As the personal ME identifier is generated randomly, it is not guaranteed that it uniquely identifies a
               specific ME used by the same user.

The personal ME identifier has the form PMI-XXXX, where XXXX is a 4-digit hexadecimal number. Only the
hexadecimal number XXXX is coded in the personal ME identifier information element.

The personal ME identifier information element is coded as shown in figure O.2/3GPP TS 24.008 and table O.2/3GPP
TS 24.008.

The personal ME identifier is a type 3 information element with 3 octets length.

O.5           Handling of unknown, unforeseen, and erroneous
              protocol data

O.5.1         General
The following subclauses specifies procedures for the handling of unknown, unforeseen, and erroneous protocol data by
the receiving MS. These procedures are called "error handling procedures", but in addition to providing recovery
mechanisms for error situations they define a compatibility mechanism for future extensions of the protocols.

Subclauses O.5.2 to O.5.5 shall be applied in order of precedence.

For the definition of semantical and syntactical errors see 3GPP TS 24.007 [20], subclause 11.4.2.

Where the description of information elements in the present document contains bits defined to be "spare bits", these
bits shall set to the indicated value (usually 0) by the sending side, and their value shall be ignored by the receiving side.


O.5.2         Not supported IEs, unknown IEIs
The MS shall ignore all information elements which are not supported and all information elements with unknown IEI.


O.5.3         Repeated IEs
If an information element, for which repetition is not specified in subclause O.2, is repeated in the user-user protocol

Annex P (normative):
Mobility management for IMS voice termination

P.1          Introduction
The present annex specifies additional requirements for GMM and EMM in the MS for the support of terminating
access domain selection for voice calls or voice sessions by the network.

Support of these mobility management procedures can be configured in the MS by a setting. Whether the mobility
management for IMS voice termination setting is stored in the IMS management object as defined in
3GPP TS 24.167 [134] (see the "Mobility Management for IMS Voice Termination" leaf) or in an alternative way in the
ME is an implementation option. If this setting is missing, then mobility management for IMS voice termination is
disabled.



P.2          Activation of mobility management for IMS voice
             termination
An MS activates mobility management for IMS voice termination when:

   1) the MS's availability for voice calls in the IMS (see 3GPP TS 24.301 [120], subclause 3.1) changes from "not
      available" to "available";

   2) the MS is enabled for mobility management for IMS voice termination;

   3) the IMS voice over PS session indicator received for Iu mode has the value

      -   "IMS voice over PS session supported in Iu mode, but not supported in A/Gb mode", or

      the IMS voice over PS session indicator received for S1 mode has the value

      -   "IMS voice over PS session in S1 mode supported"; and

   4) at least one of the two parameters voice domain preference for UTRAN and voice domain preference for
      E-UTRAN as defined in 3GPP TS 24.167 [134] is not "CS voice only".

The MS deactivates mobility management for IMS voice termination when the MS's availability for voice calls in the
IMS (see 3GPP TS 24.301 [120], subclause 3.1) changes from "available" to "not available".



P.3          Inter-system change between A/Gb mode and
             Iu mode
An MS is required to perform routing area updating for IMS voice termination if:

   1) the upper layers have indicated that the MS is available for voice calls in the IMS (see 3GPP TS 24.301 [120],
      subclause 3.1);

   2) the MS is enabled for mobility management for IMS voice termination;

   3) the "IMS voice over PS session indicator" received for Iu mode has the value "IMS voice over PS session
      supported in Iu mode, but not supported in A/Gb mode"; and

   4) the voice domain preference for UTRAN as defined in 3GPP TS 24.167 [134] is not "CS voice only".

P.4           Inter-system change between A/Gb mode and
              S1 mode
An MS is required to perform routing area updating for IMS voice termination at inter-system change from S1 mode to
A/Gb mode and tracking area updating for IMS voice termination at inter-system change from A/Gb mode to S1 mode
if:

   1) conditions 1 and 2 of annex P.3 are fulfilled;

   2) the "IMS voice over PS session indicator" received for S1 mode has the value "IMS voice over PS session in
      S1 mode supported"; and

   3) the voice domain preference for E-UTRAN as defined in 3GPP TS 24.167 [134] is not "CS voice only".



P.5           Inter-system change between Iu mode and S1 mode
An MS is required to perform routing area updating for IMS voice termination at inter-system change from S1 mode to
Iu mode and tracking area updating for IMS voice termination at inter-system change from Iu mode to S1 mode if:

   1) conditions 1 and 2 of annex P.3 are fulfilled; and

   2) any of the following conditions a, b and c is fulfilled:

      a) the IMS voice over PS session indicators received for Iu mode and S1 mode have the values

          -   "IMS voice over PS session supported in Iu mode, but not supported in A/Gb mode" and

          -   "IMS voice over PS session in S1 mode not supported", and

          the voice domain preference for UTRAN as defined in 3GPP TS 24.167 [134] is not "CS voice only";

      b) the IMS voice over PS session indicators received for Iu mode and S1 mode have the values

          -   "IMS voice over PS session in Iu mode and A/G mode not supported" and

          -   "IMS voice over PS session in S1 mode supported", and

          the voice domain preference for E-UTRAN as defined in 3GPP TS 24.167 [134] is not "CS voice only"; or

      c) the IMS voice over PS session indicators received for Iu mode and S1 mode have the values

          -   "IMS voice over PS session supported in Iu mode, but not supported in A/Gb mode" and

          -   "IMS voice over PS session in S1 mode supported", and

          exactly one of the voice domain preferences for UTRAN and E-UTRAN as defined in 3GPP TS 24.167 [134]
          is "CS voice only".

Annex Q (normative):
Application specific Congestion control for Data
Communication (ACDC) (Iu mode only)
The MS may support the procedures in this annex.

When GMM requests the establishment of a PS signalling connection, if the MS supports ACDC, the GMM layer shall
determine the ACDC category applicable to the request based on the application identifier received from the upper
layers and the configuration information in the "ACDCConf" leaf of ACDC MO as specified in 3GPP TS 24.105 [154]
or in the USIM EFACDC as specified in 3GPP TS 31.102 [112].

   NOTE 1: As an implementation option, the upper layers can determine the ACDC category and send it to the GMM
           layer. Then the GMM layer need not read the ACDC MO or USIM to determine the ACDC category.

The GMM sublayer shall indicate to the lower layers, for the purpose of access control:

   -   the ACDC category that applies to this request if only one ACDC category is applicable;

   -   the highest ranked ACDC category among the ACDC categories that applies to this request if multiple ACDC
       categories are applicable; or

   -   this request is for an uncategorized application if an application identifier received from the upper layers is not
       mapped to any ACDC category,

except for the following cases:

   -   the MS is a MS configured to use AC11 – 15 in selected PLMN;

   -   the MS is answering to paging;

   -   the RRC Establishment cause is set to "Emergency call"; or

   -   if conditions MO MMTEL voice call is started or MO MMTEL video call is started or MO SMSoIP is started, is
       satisfied.

   NOTE 2: The request from the GMM sublayer refers to either a request to establish an initial NAS signalling
           connection or a request to re-establish a NAS signalling connection.

If the MS supports ACDC and access is barred because of ACDC, the GMM layer shall keep track of the ACDC
category for which access is barred and it shall not send a request for the same ACDC category or a lower ACDC
category until access is granted.

If the MS supports ACDC and access is barred because of ACDC, the GMM layer shall not send a request for any
uncategorized application until access is granted.
