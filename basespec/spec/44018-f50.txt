         Foreword

This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP).

The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work within the TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the TSG modify the contents of the present document, it will be re-released by the TSG with an identifying change of release date and an increase in version number as follows:

  Version x.y.z

  where:

    x	the first digit:

       1	presented to TSG for information;

       2	presented to TSG for approval;

       3	or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.

    y	the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.

    z	the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been incorporated in the document.



         1	Scope

The present document specifies the procedures used at the radio interface (Reference Point Um, see 3GPP TS 24.002) for Radio Resource (RR) management.

Notation "Reserved sub-clause number" is used to indicate which sub-clauses of the specification were moved from this part of the standard to the other part when this standard was split between RAN and CN parts.

When the notations for "further study" or "FS" or "FFS" are present in this specification they mean that the indicated text is not a normative portion of this standard.

These procedures are defined in terms of messages exchanged over the control channels of the radio interface. The control channels are described in 3GPP TS 44.003.

The structured functions and procedures of this protocol and the relationship with other layers and entities are described in general terms in 3GPP TS 24.007.


1.1	Scope of the Technical Specification

The procedures currently described in the present document are for radio resource management for circuit-switched and GPRS services.

3GPP TS 24.010 contains functional procedures for support of supplementary services.

3GPP TS 24.011 contains functional procedures for support of point-to-point short message services.

3GPP TS 44.012 contains functional description of short message - cell broadcast.

3GPP TS 44.060 contains procedures for radio link control and medium access control (RLC/MAC) of packet data physical channels.

3GPP TS 44.071 contains functional descriptions and procedures for support of location services.

3GPP TS 24.008 contains the procedures for CN protocols.

  NOTE:	"layer 3" includes the functions and protocols described in this Technical Specification. The terms "data link layer" and "layer 2" are used interchangeably to refer to the layer immediately below layer 3.


1.2	Application to the interface structures

The layer 3 procedures apply to the interface structures defined in 3GPP TS 44.003. They use the functions and services provided by layer 2 defined in 3GPP TS 44.005 and 3GPP TS 44.006. 3GPP TS 24.007 gives the general description of layer 3 including procedures, messages format and error handling.


1.3	Structure of layer 3 procedures

A building block method is used to describe the layer 3 procedures.

The basic building blocks are "elementary procedures" provided by the protocol control entities of the three sublayers, i.e. radio resource management, mobility management and connection management sublayer.

Complete layer 3 transactions consist of specific sequences of elementary procedures. The term "structured procedure" is used for these sequences.


1.4	Test procedures

Test procedures of the GSM radio interface signalling are described in 3GPP TS 51.010 and 3GPP TS 51.02x series.


1.5	Use of logical channels

The logical control channels are defined in 3GPP TS 45.002. In the following those control channels are considered which carry signalling information or specific types of user packet information:

  i)	Broadcast Control CHannel (BCCH): downlink only, used to broadcast Cell specific information;

  ii)	Synchronization CHannel (SCH): downlink only, used to broadcast synchronization and BSS identification information;

  iii)	Paging CHannel (PCH): downlink only, used to send page requests to Mobile Stations (MSs);

  iv)	Random Access CHannel (RACH): uplink only, used to request a Dedicated Control CHannel;

  v)	Access Grant CHannel (AGCH): downlink only, used to allocate a Dedicated Control CHannel;

  vi)	Standalone Dedicated Control CHannel (SDCCH): bi-directional;

  vii)	Fast Associated Control CHannel (FACCH): bi-directional, associated with a Traffic CHannel;

  viii)	Slow Associated Control CHannel (SACCH): bi-directional, associated with a SDCCH or a Traffic CHannel;

  ix)	Cell Broadcast CHannel (CBCH): downlink only used for general (not point to point) short message information;

  x)	Notification CHannel (NCH): downlink only, used to notify mobile stations of VBS (Voice Broadcast Service) calls or VGCS (Voice Group Call Service) calls.

  xi)	Extended Coverage Broadcast Control CHannel (EC-BCCH): downlink only, used to broadcast Cell specific information in cells that support EC-GSM-IoT;

  xii)	Extended Coverage Synchronization CHannel (EC-SCH): downlink only, used to broadcast synchronization, BSS identification, EC-BCCH CHANGE MARK, Implicit Reject Status and RACH Access Control in cells that support EC-GSM-IoT;

  xiii)	Extended Coverage Paging CHannel (EC-PCH): downlink only, used to send page requests to EC capable Mobile Stations (MSs) in cells that support EC-GSM-IoT;

  xiv)	Extended Coverage Access Grant CHannel (EC-AGCH): downlink only, used to allocate packet resources to EC capable Mobile Stations (MSs) in cells that support EC-GSM-IoT;

  xv)	Extended Coverage Random Access CHannel (EC-RACH): uplink only, used to request uplink packet resources by EC capable Mobile Stations (MSs) in cells that support EC-GSM-IoT;

Two service access points are defined on signalling layer 2 which are discriminated by their Service Access Point Identifiers (SAPI) (see 3GPP TS 44.006):

  i)	SAPI 0: supports the transfer of signalling information including user-user information;

  ii)	SAPI 3: supports the transfer of user short messages.

Layer 3 selects the service access point, the logical control channel and the mode of operation of layer 2 (acknowledged, unacknowledged or random access, see 3GPP TS 44.005 and 3GPP TS 44.006) as required for each individual message.

1.7	Applicability of implementations

The applicability of procedures of this technical specification for the mobile station is dependent on the services and functions which are to be supported by a mobile station. For the MS, the Revision level indicating Release 1999 is linked to the full support of the RR protocol and procedures in 3GPP TS 44.018 Release 1999.


1.7.1	Voice Group Call Service (VGCS) and Voice Broadcast Service (VBS)

For mobile stations supporting the Voice Group Call Service or the Voice Broadcast Service, it is explicitly mentioned throughout this technical specification if a certain procedure is applicable only for such a service and, if necessary, how mobile stations not supporting such a service shall behave.

For VGCS and VBS, the following possible mobile station implementations exist:

  -	support of listening to voice broadcast calls (VBS listening);

  -	support of originating a voice broadcast call (VBS originating);

  -	support of listening to voice group calls (VGCS listening);

  -	support of talking in voice group calls (VGCS talking. This always includes the implementation for VGCS listening);

  -	support of originating a voice group call (VGCS originating. This always includes the implementation for VGCS talking).

Apart from the explicitly mentioned combinations, all possible combinations are optional and supported by this technical specification.

A VGCS capable mobile station shall support USIM-based VGCS ciphering.

The related terms are used in this technical specification, if information on these implementation options is required.


1.7.2	General Packet Radio Service (GPRS)

For mobile stations supporting the General Packet Radio Service (GPRS), it is explicitly mentioned throughout the technical specification if a certain procedure is applicable only for such a service and, if necessary, how mobile stations not supporting such a service shall behave.

A GPRS MS may operate in one of the following MS operation modes, see 3GPP TS 23.060:

  -	MS operation mode A;

  -	MS operation mode B; or

  -	MS operation mode C.

The MS operation mode depends on the services that the MS is attached to, i.e., only GPRS or both GPRS and non-GPRS services, and upon the MS's capabilities to operate GPRS and other GSM services simultaneously. Mobile stations that are capable to operate GPRS services are referred to as GPRS MSs.

  NOTE:	Other GSM technical specifications may refer to the MS operation modes A, B, and C as GPRS class-A MS, GPRS class-B MS, and GPRS class-C MS.

It should be noted that it is possible that for a GPRS MS, the GMM procedures currently described in the present document do not support combinations of VGCS, VBS and GPRS. The possible interactions are not studied yet.


1.7.3	Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast Service (MBMS)

For mobile stations supporting the Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast Service (MBMS) feature, it is explicitly mentioned throughout the technical specification if a certain procedure is applicable only for such a service and, if necessary, how mobile stations not supporting such a service shall behave.

The support of dedicated mode MBMS notification is mandatory for mobile stations and optional for networks supporting the Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast Service (MBMS) feature. The dedicated mode MBMS notification consists of the Service Information Sending procedure and the MBMS announcement of mobile stations in dedicated mode.


1.8	Restrictions

Independently of what is stated elsewhere in this and other 3GPP specifications, mobile station support for PBCCH and PCCCH is optional for A/Gb-mode of operation. The network shall never enable PBCCH and PCCCH.

2.1	Abbreviations

For the purposes of the present document, the abbreviations given in 3GPP TR 21.905 apply. In addition to abbreviations in 3GPP TR 21.905 the following abbreviations apply:

  ESAB	Extended Synchronization Access Burst
  EDAB	Extended Dual slot Access Burst


2.1.1	Random values

In a number of places in the present document, it is mentioned that some value must take a "random" value, in a given range, or more generally with some statistical distribution. Such cases interest only the Mobile Station.

It is required that there is a low probability that two MSs in the same conditions (including the case of two MSs of the same type from the same manufacturer) will choose the same value. Moreover, it is required that, if it happens that two MSs in similar conditions choose the same value, the probability of their choices being identical at the next occasion is the same as if their first choices had been different.

The meaning of such a specification is that any statistical test for these values, done on a series of similar events, will obtain a result statistically compatible with the specified distribution. This shall hold even in the cases where the tests are conducted with a subset of possible events, with some common parameters. Moreover, basic tests of independence of the values within the series shall pass.

Data against which correlation with the values shall not be found are the protocol state, or the IMSI, or identities or other unrelated information broadcast by the network, or the current TDMA frame number.


2.1.2	Vocabulary

The following terms are used in this Technical Specification:

  -	idle mode: In this mode, the mobile station is not allocated any dedicated channel; it listens to the CCCH and the BCCH.

  -	group receive mode: (only applicable for mobile stations supporting VGCS listening or VBS listening) In this mode, the mobile station is not allocated a dedicated channel with the network; it listens to the downlink of a voice broadcast channel or voice group call channel allocated to the cell. Occasionally, the mobile station has to listen to the BCCH of the serving cell as defined in 3GPP TS 23.022 and 3GPP TS 45.008. When talker priority is supported, and the network requires priority talker requests to be signalled on the RACH, the mobile station may temporarily leave the group receive mode, and establish a SDCCH, in order to initiate a priority uplink request. Once the priority uplink request has been sent, the SDCCH is released and the mobile returns to group receive mode.

  -	dedicated mode: In this mode, the mobile station is allocated at least two dedicated channels, only one of them being a SACCH.

  -	group transmit mode: (only applicable for mobile stations supporting VGCS talking) In this mode, one mobile station of a voice group call is allocated two dedicated channels, one of them being a SACCH. These channels can be allocated to one mobile station at a time but to different mobile stations during the voice group call. Additionally, when talker priority is supported by the network, further mobile stations may establish RR connections on the group channel in order to initiate an uplink access.

  -	packet idle mode: (only applicable for mobile stations supporting GPRS services – see 3GPP TS 23.060 [74]) In this mode, mobile station is not allocated any radio resource on a packet data physical channel; it listens to the PBCCH and PCCCH or, if those are not provided by the network, to the BCCH and the CCCH (see 3GPP TS 44.060) or, if the mobile station has enabled EC operation, to the EC-BCCH and the EC-CCCH, see sub-clause 3.10 and 3.5.1a.

  -	packet transfer mode: (only applicable for mobile stations supporting GPRS services – see 3GPP TS 23.060 [74]) In this mode, the mobile station is allocated radio resource on one or more packet data physical channels for the transfer of LLC PDUs.

  -	dual transfer mode: (only applicable for mobile stations supporting GPRS and DTM) In this mode, the mobile station is allocated radio resources providing an RR connection and one or more Temporary Block Flow (3GPP TS 44.060) on one or more physical channels. The allocation of radio resource for the RR connection and the Temporary Block Flows is co-ordinated by the network to comply with the capabilities of the mobile station in dual transfer mode.

  -	main DCCH: In Dedicated mode and group transmit mode, only two channels are used as DCCH, one being a SACCH, the other being a SDCCH or a FACCH; the SDCCH or FACCH is called here "the main DCCH".

  -	A channel is activated if it can be used for transmission, in particular for signalling, at least with UI frames. On the SACCH, whenever activated, it must be ensured that a contiguous stream of layer 2 frames is sent.

  -	A TCH is connected if circuit mode user data can be transferred. A TCH cannot be connected if it is not activated. A TCH which is activated but not connected is used only for signalling, i.e. as a DCCH.

  -	The data link of SAPI 0 on the main DCCH is called the main signalling link. Any message specified to be sent on the main signalling link is sent in acknowledged mode except when otherwise specified.

  -	The term "to establish" a link is a short form for "to establish the multiframe mode" on that data link. It is possible to send UI frames on a data link even if it is not established as soon as the corresponding channel is activated. Except when otherwise indicated, a data link layer establishment is done without an information field.

  -	"channel set" is used to identify TCHs that carry related user information flows, e.g., in a multislot configuration used to support circuit switched connection(s), which therefore need to be handled together.

  -	A temporary block flow (TBF) is a physical connection used by the two RR peer entities to support the uni-directional transfer of LLC PDUs on packet data physical channels, see 3GPP TS 44.060.

  -	RLC/MAC block: A RLC/MAC block is the protocol data unit exchanged between RLC/MAC entities, see 3GPP TS 44.060.

  -	A GMM context is established when a GPRS attach procedure is successfully completed.

  -	Network operation mode

    	The three different network operation modes I, II, and III are defined in 3GPP TS 23.060.

    	The network operation mode shall be indicated as system information. For proper operation, the network operation mode should be the same in each cell of one routing area.

  -	GPRS MS operation mode

    	The three different GPRS MS operation modes A, B, and C are defined in 3GPP TS 23.060.

  -	DTM handover is a feature used by the network to command a mobile station to move from its old (source) cell to a new (target) cell while operating in dual transfer mode and continue the operation of its ongoing circuit switched service and one or more of its ongoing packet switched services in the new cell. The mobile station is allocated one circuit switched radio resource and packet switched radio resources applicable to the new cell within a DTM HANDOVER COMMAND message.

  -	Downlink Dual Carrier is a capability of the mobile station to receive on two radio frequency channels simultaneously. It is only applicable for mobiles which support EGPRS.

  -	Downlink Multi Carrier is a feature allowing resources for a downlink TBF (and optionally an uplink TBF) to be assigned to a mobile station on two or more radio frequency channels in the same or different frequency bands using EGPRS or EGPRS2-A.

  -	CSG Cells Reporting

    	Refers to the ability of the mobile station to report measurements, CSG-ID and routing parameters of CSG cells in dedicated mode and dual transfer mode. For UTRAN cells, routing parameters include Cell Identity and optionally the PLMN-ID.

  -	Extended Access Barring (EAB) is an optional feature used by the network to control whether or not mobile stations configured for EAB are allowed to attempt system access (see 3GPP TS 22.011). When EAB is in use within a given cell a mobile station configured for EAB reads system information to acquire EAB related information which it uses in conjunction with its Access Class (i.e. a single value in the range 0,1, …9) to determine if it can attempt a system access.

  -	Selective Ciphering of Downlink SACCH, when ciphering is started between the network and the mobile station, refers to:

    -	the mechanism used by the network in downlink to cipher or not to cipher any given individual SACCH block selectively according to its content; and accordingly the ability of the mobile station to decode any given individual SACCH block whether it is ciphered or not. See sub-clause 3.4.7a.

  -	Network sharing: network sharing is an optional feature that allows different core network operators to connect to the same shared radio access network (see 3GPP TS 23.251). When network sharing is in use within a given cell, the network broadcasts within system information the PLMN identities of the PLMNs sharing the cell. A mobile station supporting network sharing uses this information for its PLMN (re)selection processes and indicates the selected PLMN to the BSS.

  -	Common PLMN: when network sharing is in use within a given cell, the Common PLMN refers to the PLMN of which the PLMN ID is broadcast in the SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 3 and SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 4 messages (as part of the Location Area Identification) and, when EC-GSM-IoT is supported in the cell (see 3GPP TS 43.064 [109], in the EC SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 2 message. See sub-clauses 9.1.35, 9.1.36, 9.1.43q and 3GPP TS 23.251, 3GPP TS 24.008.

  -	Additional PLMN: when network sharing is in use within a given cell, an Additional PLMN refers to a PLMN of which the PLMN ID is broadcast in the SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 22 message (see sub-clause 10.5.2.37n) and, when EC-GSM-IoT is supported in the cell, in the EC SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 4 message (see sub-clause 9.1.43s).

  -	Domain-specific access control: domain-specific access control is an optional feature that allows the network to send, on a PLMN specific basis, different access control information for the CS and PS domains (see 3GPP TS 22.011). A mobile station supporting domain-specific access control uses this information for its access control check process. Support of domain-specific access control is possible only if network sharing is supported.

  -	IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS)

    -	The IP Multimedia Subsystem comprises all CN elements for provision of IP multimedia services, see 3GPP TS 23.228 [104].

  -	Single Radio Voice Call Continuity (SRVCC)

    -	refers to voice call continuity between IMS over PS access and CS access for calls that are anchored in IMS when the MS is capable of transmitting/receiving on only one of those access networks at a given time; a mobile station supporting SRVCC is enhanced for IMS Service Continuity with the additional MS capabilities described in 3GPP TS 23.216 for SRVCC from E-UTRAN to UTRAN (HSPA) or GERAN or from UTRAN (HSPA) to E-UTRAN or GERAN or from GERAN to E-UTRAN or UTRAN (HSPA). SRVCC from GERAN to E-UTRAN or UTRAN (HSPA) is known also as CS to PS SRVCC.

  -	Extended EARFCNs

    -	refers to extended EARFCN value range (0 …262143) with EARFCNs coded over 18 bits. Mobile station  and network support of extended EARFCNs is mandatory when network sharing is supported; support of extended EARFCNs is optional otherwise.
       When network sharing is in use within a given cell, the network shall provide extended EARFCNs within the SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 23 message, if broadcasted in the cell; additionally when extended EARFCNs is in use within a given cell, the network may provide at least one EARFCN value > 65535 within the SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 2quater message.

3	Radio Resource management procedures


3.1	Overview/General


3.1.1	General

Radio Resource management procedures include the functions related to the management of the common transmission resources, e.g. the physical channels and the data link connections on control channels.

The general purpose of Radio Resource procedures is to establish, maintain and release RR connections that allow a point-to-point dialogue between the network and a mobile station. This includes the cell selection/reselection and the handover procedures. Moreover, Radio Resource management procedures include the reception of the uni-directional BCCH and CCCH when no RR connection is established. This permits automatic cell selection/reselection.

If VGCS listening or VBS listening are supported, the radio resource management also includes the functions for the reception of the voice group call channel or the voice broadcast channel, respectively, and the automatic cell reselection of the mobile station in Group receive mode.

If VGCS talking is supported, the radio resource management also includes the functions for the seizure and release of the voice group call channel.

If GPRS point-to-point services are supported, the radio resource management procedures includes functions related to the management of transmission resources on packet data physical channels. This includes the broadcast of system information to support a mobile station in packet idle and packet transfer modes, see also 3GPP TS 44.060.

  NOTE 1:	This chapter includes some procedures used for multislot operation and for the TCH/H + TCH/H configuration which need not be supported by simple mobile stations.

  NOTE 2:	The procedures and the information content relating to the TCH/H + TCH/H configuration in RR messages is for further study.

If dedicated mode MBMS Notification is supported, the radio resource management procedures includes functions to allow the announcement of the starting MBMS services.


3.1.2	Services provided to upper layers

A RR connection is a physical connection used by the two peer entities to support the upper layers' exchange of information flows.


3.1.2.1	Idle mode

In idle mode no RR connection exists.

The RR procedures include (on the mobile station side) those for automatic cell selection/reselection. The RR entity indicates to upper layers the unavailability of a BCCH/CCCH and the cell change when decided by the RR entity. Upper layers are advised of the BCCH broadcast information when a new cell has been selected, or when a relevant part of this information changes.

For cell-reselection the BA (list), together with the 3G Cell Reselection list and/or the E-UTRAN Neighbour Cell list for a multi-RAT MS, shall be used.

In Idle mode, upper layers can require the establishment of an RR connection.


3.1.2.2	Dedicated mode

In dedicated mode, the RR connection is a physical point-to-point bi-directional connection, and includes a SAPI 0 data link connection operating in multiframe mode on the main DCCH. If dedicated mode is established, RR procedures provide the following services:

  -	establishment/release of multiframe mode on data link layer connections other than SAPI 0, on the main DCCH or on the SACCH associated with the channel carrying the main signalling link;

  -	transfer of messages on any data link layer connection;

  -	indication of temporary unavailability of transmission (suspension, resuming);

  -	indication of loss of RR connection;

  -	automatic cell reselection and handover to maintain the RR connection;

  -	setting/change of the transmission mode on the physical channels, including change of type of channel, change of the coding/decoding/transcoding mode and setting of ciphering;

  -	allocation/release of an additional channel (for the TCH/H + TCH/H configuration);

  -	allocation/release of additional channels for multislot operation;

  -	release of an RR connection.


3.1.2.3	Group receive mode

Only applicable for mobile stations supporting VGCS listening or VBS listening.

In this mode, the RR procedures on the mobile station side provide the services:

  -	local connection to the voice broadcast channel or voice group call channel;

  -	reception of messages in unacknowledged mode;

  -	automatic cell reselection for the mobile station in Group receive mode;

  -	uplink reply procedure to indicate that the mobile station is listening to the voice group call or voice broadcast call;

  -	local disconnection from the received voice group call or broadcast call channels.

For mobile stations supporting both VGCS listening and VGCS transmit, in addition, the RR procedures on the mobile station side provide the service:

  -	uplink access procedures to establish the RR connection;

  -	priority uplink request procedures to establish the RR connection, if talker priority is supported by the mobile station.

  -	Uplink access procedures to establish the RR connection for sending application-specific data to the network


3.1.2.4	Group transmit mode

Only applicable for mobile stations supporting VGCS talking.

In group transmit mode, the RR connection is a physical point-to-point bi-directional connection, and includes a SAPI 0 and possibly a SAPI 3 data link connection(s) operating in multiframe mode on the main DCCH. If the group transmit mode is established, RR procedures provide the following services:

  -	transfer of messages on the SAPI 0 and optionally on the SAPI 3 of the data link layer connection;

  -	indication of loss of RR connection;

  -	automatic cell reselection and handover to maintain the RR connection;

  -	setting of the transmission mode on the physical channels, change of type of channel and setting of ciphering;

  -	release of the RR connection.


3.1.2.5	Packet idle mode

Only applicable for mobile stations supporting GPRS.

In packet idle mode, no temporary block flow exists (see 3GPP TS 44.060). Upper layers may require the transfer of a LLC PDU, which implicitly triggers the establishment of a temporary block flow.


3.1.2.6	Packet transfer mode

Only applicable for mobile stations supporting GPRS.

In packet transfer mode, the mobile station is allocated radio resources providing a temporary block flow on one or more packet data physical channels. If the mobile station supports Downlink Dual Carrier, these physical channels may be on different radio frequency channels for a DLMC configuration (see 3GPP TS 24.008). If the mobile station supports Downlink Multi Carrier, these physical channels may be on different radio frequency channels in the same or in different frequency bands for a DLMC configuration (see 3GPP TS 24.008). The RR sublayer provides the following services, see also 3GPP TS 44.060:

  -	transfer of LLC PDUs in acknowledged mode;

  -	transfer of LLC PDUs in unacknowledged mode.

Depending on the GPRS mode of operation (class A or B), the mobile station may leave both packet idle mode and packet transfer mode before entering dedicated mode, group receive mode or group transmit mode.

Cell reselection in packet idle and packet transfer modes is specified in 3GPP TS 45.008. The RR entity on the mobile station side indicates to the upper layers the availability of a cell and a cell change when decided by the RR sublayer. Upper layers are advised of system information broadcast in the cell when a new cell has been selected, or when a relevant part of this information changes.


3.1.2.7	Dual transfer mode (DTM)

In dual transfer mode, the mobile station is simultaneously in dedicated mode and in packet transfer mode.This feature is optional for the mobile station and the network. It is only applicable for a mobile station supporting GPRS, EGPRS or EGPRS2. Dual transfer mode is a subset of class A mode of operation, only possible if there is radio resource allocation co-ordination in the network. Simultaneous handover of resources to maintain the RR connection and the temporary block flows (see 3GPP TS 44.060) may occur in dual transfer mode if both the mobile station and the network support DTM handover (see sub-clause 3.7). DLMC configuration is not supported in DTM.


3.1.3	Services required from data link and physical layers

The RR sublayer uses the services provided by the data link layer as defined in 3GPP TS 44.005.

Moreover, the RR sublayer directly uses services provided by the physical layer such as BCCH searching and transfer of RLC/MAC blocks, as defined in 3GPP TS 44.004.


3.1.4	Change of dedicated channels


3.1.4.1	Change of dedicated channels using SAPI = 0

In case a change of dedicated channels is required using a dedicated assignment and handover procedure, respectively, the RR sublayer will request the data link layer to suspend multiple frame operation before the mobile station leaves the old channel. When the channel change has been completed, layer 3 will request the data link layer to resume multiple frame operation again. The layer 2 suspend/resume procedures are described in 3GPP TS 44.005 and 3GPP TS 44.006.

These procedures are specified in such a way that a loss of a layer 3 message cannot occur on the radio interface. However, messages sent from the mobile station to the network may be duplicated by the data link layer if a message has been transmitted but not yet completely acknowledged before the mobile station leaves the old channel (see 3GPP TS 44.006).

As the RR sublayer is controlling the channel change, a duplication of RR messages does not occur. However, there are some procedures for which a duplication is possible, e.g. DTMF procedures. For all upper layer procedures using the transport service of the GSM RR sub-layer (e.g., MM and CM procedures but not GMM or Session Management procedures), the request messages sent by the mobile station contain a sequence number in order to allow the network to detect duplicated messages, which are then ignored by the network. The same sequence number is used to protect against message duplication caused by channel changes between GSM and UTRAN and also by other UTRAN procedures (e.g. hard handover). The procedures for sequenced transmission on layer 3 are described in 3GPP TS 24.007.


3.1.4.2	Change of dedicated channels using other SAPIs than 0

For SAPIs other than 0, the data link procedures described in 3GPP TS 44.006 do not provide any guarantee against message loss or duplication.

Therefore, if an application uses a SAPI other than 0 and if this application is sensitive to message loss or duplication, then it has to define its own protection mechanism. No general protection mechanism is provided by the protocol defined in this Technical Specification.


3.1.5	Procedure for Service Request and Contention Resolution

Upon seizure of the assigned dedicated channel or group channel, the mobile station establishes the main signalling link on this channel by sending a layer 2 SABM frame containing a layer 3 service request message. The data link layer will store this message to perform the contention resolution. The service request message will be returned by the network in the UA frame.

The data link layer in the mobile station compares the content of the information field (i.e. the layer 3 service request message) received in the UA frame with the stored message and leaves the channel in case they do not match. This procedure resolves contentions in the case where several mobile stations have accessed at the same random access slot and with the same random reference and one has succeeded due to capture. The full description of the procedure is given in 3GPP TS 44.006.

  NOTE:	When this procedure is used to respond to an encapsulated IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT message or an encapsulated DTM ASSIGNMENT message (see sub-clause 3.6), random access and contention resolution are not used.

The purpose of the service request message is to indicate to the network which service the mobile station is requesting. This then allows the network to decide how to proceed (e.g. to authenticate or not).

The service request message must contain the identity of the mobile station and may include further information which can be sent without encryption.

The layer 3 service request message is typically one of the following:

  -	CM SERVICE REQUEST;

3.1.6	Preemption

The datalink layer provides the capability to assign a priority to any message transferred in dedicated mode on SAPI 0 with multiframe operation. The available message priorities defined in 3GPP TS 44.006 are "high", "normal" and "low". Messages assigned a "high" priority are enabled to preempt, in the data link layer, all preceeding untransmitted and partially transmitted messages assigned a "low" priority that are using the same data link connection (same SAPI and logical channel). Messages or message portions that are preempted are discarded without notification to higher layers except that the first 2*N201 octets of any partially transmitted message are not discarded. The following priority assignments are defined for those Radio Resource, Mobility Management and Connection Management messages that use SAPI 0.

Use of the preemption capability by layer 3 is not required in a BSS or MS that does not send any "low" priority message. In this case, all messages may be treated as having "normal" priority.

Preemption capabilities in Layer 3 is not applicable to the Uplink messages, hence all Uplink messages are treated with "normal" priority. Note that the "Suspension and Resumption of Multiple frame operation" (See 3GPP TS 44.006) will affect the order in which the layer 3 messages are delivered on the Uplink.


3.2	Idle mode procedures and general procedures in packet idle and packet transfer modes


3.2.1	Mobile Station side

In idle mode, the MS listens to the BCCH or EC-BCCH and to the paging sub-channel for the paging group the MS belongs to in idle mode (cf. 3GPP TS 43.013); it measures the radio propagation for connection with other cells.

In packet idle and packet transfer modes (applicable only to a GPRS mobile station) the mobile station listens to either the PBCCH, if that is present in the cell, or BCCH. The requirements for the monitoring of system information is further specified in 3GPP TS 45.008 [34]. An exception case is where a mobile station has enabled PEO or EC operation in which case the following applies:

  -	A MS that has enabled PEO shall monitor system information on the BCCH, when in packet idle mode, as described in sub-clause 3.9.

  -	A MS that has enabled EC operation shall monitor system information on the EC-BCCH, when in packet idle mode, as described in sub-clause 3.10.

Moreover, the mobile station measures the radio propagation for connection with other cells. A MS that has enabled PEO or EC operation shall only measure the radio propagation for connection with other cells when the serving cell is no longer determined to be suitable (see 3GPP TS 45.008 [34]).

A mobile station camping on the cell as a result of a cell change order or redirection from E-UTRAN to GERAN is not required to perform the complete acquisition of the system information of the cell on BCCH before proceeding with a RR connection establishment (see sub-clause 3.3).

The mobile station shall perform the acquisition on the BCCH of the cell of the following messages if not provided in the MobilityFromEUTRACommand or, respectively, in the E-UTRA RRCConnectionRelease message and the mobile station is not performing CS fallback (see 3GPP TS 36.331):

  -	SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 3,

  -	for a GPRS capable mobile station in a cell supporting GPRS, SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 13, and

  -	SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 1 if broadcast in the cell (see 3GPP TS 45.002).

The mobile station shall perform the acquisition on the BCCH of the cell of the following messages if not provided in the E-UTRA RRCConnectionRelease message and the mobile station is performing CS fallback (see 3GPP TS 36.331):

  -	SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 3,

  -	SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 1 if broadcast in the cell (see 3GPP TS 45.002).

If SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 3 and, for a GPRS capable mobile station in a cell supporting GPRS, SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 13 were received in the MobilityFromEUTRACommand message or in the E-UTRA RRCConnectionRelease message but SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 1 was not included, the mobile station shall assume that SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 1 is not broadcast in the cell.

In packet idle mode (applicable only to a GPRS mobile station ), a mobile station listens to the paging sub-channels on the PCCCH or CCCH. An exception case is where a mobile station has enabled PEO or EC operation in which case the following applies:

  -	A MS that has enabled PEO listens to its paging sub-channel (nominal paging group) on the CCCH as described in sub-clause 3.9.

  -	A mobile station that has enabled EC operation listens to its paging sub-channel (nominal paging group) on the EC-CCCH as described in sub-clause 3.10.

Paging sub-channels are monitored according to the paging group determined for the mobile station, its current discontinuous reception (DRX) mode and in case EC operation has been enabled, its current downlink Coverage Class. The determination of paging group for the mobile station is defined in 3GPP TS 45.002. The DRX procedures are defined in 3GPP TS 44.060 and 3GPP TS 45.002.

Mobile station support for reception of Earthquake and Tsunami Warning System (ETWS) Primary Notification messages is optional. In idle mode or in packet idle mode (applicable only to a GPRS mobile station), the mobile station may determine that an ETWS event has occurred (see sub-clause 3.2.2.3 and 9.1.22) in which case it shall leave DRX mode, start timer T3232, start reading all paging groups and attempt to acquire an ETWS Primary Notification message. The mobile station shall attempt to assemble all segments of the ETWS Primary Notification message, having the same Primary Notification Identifier (PNI) value, before delivering the complete message to the upper layers.

While attempting to acquire the ETWS Primary Notification message a mobile station shall continue to follow (packet) idle mode and connection establishment procedures. Upon initiating cell reselection or connection establishment procedures while attempting to acquire an ETWS Primary Notification message, a mobile station shall discard any partially received ETWS Primary Notification message and stop timer T3232. The mobile station shall not attempt to acquire an ETWS Primary Notification message while performing a connection establishment procedure or while performing cell reselection.

If the mobile station detects a change in the PNI value prior to acquiring a complete ETWS Primary Notification message, it shall abort the current message, restart timer T3232 and attempt to acquire the new message.

When the mobile station successfully acquires a complete ETWS Primary Notification message it shall stop timer T3232 and enter DRX mode. If timer T3232 expires the mobile station shall abort the current message and enter DRX mode.

A UTRAN capable mobile station in idle mode or packet idle mode attempts to read predefined configuration information from UTRAN Channels, as specified in 3GPP TS 45.008. This is only applicable to a mobile station supporting circuit-switched services.

Measurements are treated to assess the need of a cell change as specified in 3GPP TS 45.008. When the decision to change cells is made, the mobile station switches to the BCCH, PBCCH or EC-BCCH of the new cell. The broadcast information is then checked to verify the allowance to camp on this cell (cf. sub-clause 3.2.2). Dependent on the mobile station type and configuration, the mobile station may be required to try to read further BCCH or PBCCH or EC-BCCH information. If allowed, the cell change is confirmed, and the broadcast information is then treated for Mobility Management actions (cf. clause 4). Similarly, physical contexts are updated (list of neighbouring cells frequencies, thresholds for some actions, etc. (cf. 3GPP TS 45.008 and sub-clause 3.2.2)).

A mobile station configured for Extended Access Barring (EAB) shall read the SI3 Rest Octets IE in an attempt to determine if the SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 21 message is sent in the cell. If the SI3 Rest Octets IE does not provide this information the mobile station shall read the SI9 Rest Octets IE to make this determination (If SI 9 is sent):

  -	If the SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 21 message is sent the mobile station shall read it in an attempt to acquire EAB information (see sub-clause 10.5.2.37m).

  -	If the SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 21 message is not sent or is sent but does not include EAB information the mobile station shall consider EAB information it may have previously received to be invalid.

A mobile station that has enabled EC operation is not subject to Extended Access Barring (EAB) and shall instead use information sent in the EC SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 2 message and in the EC-SYSTEM INFORMATION type 4 message (if network sharing is supported in the cell) to determine the PLMN specific barring in effect for the serving cell. When attempting packet access it uses the PLMN specific barring and potentially the Implicit Reject Status (IRS) information sent using the EC-SCH INFORMATION message (see sub-clause 9.1.30c) to determine if packet access is allowed (see sub-clause 3.5.2a).

A mobile station supporting network sharing that has not enabled EC operation shall read the SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 3 message in an attempt to determine if the SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 22 message is sent in the cell:

  -	If the SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 22 message is sent the mobile station shall read it in an attempt to acquire network sharing information (see sub-clause 10.5.2.37n).

  -	If the SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 22 message is not sent or is sent but does not include network sharing information the mobile station shall consider network sharing as not supported in the cell and the network sharing information it may have previously received to be invalid.

A UTRAN and/or E-UTRAN capable mobile station supporting network sharing shall read the SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 22 message in an attempt to determine if the SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 23 message is sent in the cell:

  -	If the SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 23 message is sent the mobile station shall read it in an attempt to acquire UTRAN and/or E-UTRAN information for cell-reselection (as applicable) as described in sub-clause 10.5.2.37o.

  -	If the SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 23 message is sent but does not include UTRAN and/or E-UTRAN information for cell-reselection the mobile station shall consider UTRAN and/or E-UTRAN information for cell-reselection as not available in the cell and the previous information it may have received to be invalid.

  -	If the SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 23 message is not sent the mobile station shall acquire UTRAN and/or E-UTRAN information for cell-reselection from the SI2ter/SI2quater messages.

A mobile station that has enabled EC operation shall read the EC SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 3 message in an attempt to determine if the EC SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 4 message is sent in the cell:

  -	If the EC SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 4 message is sent the mobile station shall read it in an attempt to acquire network sharing information (see sub-clause 9.1.43s).

  -	If the EC SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 4 message is not sent or is sent but does not include network sharing information the mobile station shall consider network sharing as not supported in the cell and the network sharing information it may have previously received to be invalid.


3.2.2	Network side


3.2.2.1	System information broadcasting

SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 2 to 4 messages, and optionally TYPE 1, 2bis, 2ter, 7, 8, 13, 16 and 17 and further types are regularly broadcast by the network on the BCCH. Based on this information the mobile station is able to decide whether and how it may gain access to the system via the current cell. The SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 2bis message shall be sent if and only if the EXT-IND bit in the Neighbour Cell Description IE in both the TYPE 2 and TYPE 2bis messages indicates that each IE only carries part of the BA. SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 2ter message shall be sent if and only if this is indicated in SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 3 message.

A GSM 900 mobile station which only supports the primary GSM band P-GSM 900 (cf. 3GPP TS 45.005) may consider the EXT-IND bit in the Neighbour Cell Description IE in the SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 2 message as a spare bit. If it does so it shall assume that the information element carries the complete BA and it shall ignore any SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 2bis and 2ter messages.

SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 2quater messages may be sent to provide further information for Enhanced Measurement Report. It may also include UTRAN and/or E-UTRAN information for cell-reselection, measurement and reporting. A mobile station with no UTRAN capability should ignore 3G related information in this message. A mobile station with no E-UTRAN capability should ignore E-UTRAN related information in this message. SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 2quater message shall be sent if and only if this is indicated in SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 3 message.

The SI2 ter Rest Octet information element in the SI2ter message may provide information on UTRAN Cells and 3G Measurement Parameters. Information received in this message is only used for cell reselection in idle mode. The SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 2ter messages shall contain at least one 2G neighbouring cell description the ARFCN of which does not belong to the frequency band of the 2G neighbouring cells described in the SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 2 message.

When the SI2ter_MP_CHANGE_MARK parameter is changed in this information element, the MS shall re-read 3G Measurement parameters in all instances of SI2ter (by using SI2ter_INDEX and SI2ter_COUNT). When the SI2ter_3G_CHANGE_MARK is changed in this information element, the MS shall re-read UTRAN FDD Description and UTRAN TDD Description in all instances of SI2ter (by using SI2ter_INDEX and SI2ter_COUNT).

SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 2n messages may be sent to provide parameters affecting cell reselection for the neighbouring cells. SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 2n message shall be sent on BCCH (Ext) if and only if this is indicated in SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 13 message.

When the SI2n_CHANGE_MARK parameter is changed in this message, the MS shall re-read all the parameters in SI2n Rest Octets IE in a full set of SYSTEM INFORMATION 2n messages.

If the additional cell reselection parameters are broadcast then SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 3 message shall always contain these parameters. In addition to SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 3 at least either SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 4 or SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 7 and 8 messages shall contain these parameters too. SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 7 and 8 messages shall be sent if and only if this is indicated in SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 4 message.

SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 15 message is broadcast if dynamic ARFCN mapping is used in the PLMN. In this case ARFCN values are allocated and dynamically mapped to physical frequencies, see 3GPP TS 45.005. The presence of dynamic ARFCN mapping shall be indicated in Cell Options (BCCH) IE. When the value of the parameter DM_CHANGE_MARK is changed in the SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 15 message, the mobile station shall re-read information on dynamic mapping in a full set of SYSTEM INFORMATION 15 messages.

After the release of a dedicated connection, when returning to idle mode or packet idle mode, the mobile station may keep the dynamic ARFCN mapping information for the PLMN of the chosen cell under the following conditions:

  -	there has not been any handover during the connection; or

  -	the mobile station chooses the last cell (identified by the BCCH carrier and BSIC) that was used during the connection and there has not been any handover including dynamic ARFCN mapping information after reception of the dynamic ARFCN mapping information.

Otherwise, the mobile station shall acquire new dynamic ARFCN mapping information.

If additional SoLSA specific parameters are broadcast then SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 16 and 17 messages, shall always contain these parameters. In addition to SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 16 and 17 messages at least either SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 4 or SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 7 and 8 messages shall contain these SoLSA specific parameters too. SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 16 and 17 messages shall be sent if and only if this is indicated in SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 3 message. The SoLSA information of any SYSTEM INFORMATION message shall be the same.

The SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 18 and 20 messages are sent when non-GSM broadcast information must be transmitted. The scheduling and repetition rate of these messages is determined by the system operator and is indicated in SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 9 message. Mobile stations without non-GSM capabilities defined for SI 18 and SI 20 should ignore these messages. An MS with non-GSM capabilities shall decode and identify information related to the respective Non-GSM protocol by reading the Non-GSM Protocol Discriminator field.

The SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 21 message is broadcast by the network if Extended Access Barring is in use in the cell.

The SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 22 message shall be broadcast by the network if network sharing (with or without domain-specific access control) is in use in the cell. The presence of SI 22 messages shall be indicated in SI 3 message. Additionally, in this case, the network may broadcast the SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 23 message to provide PLMN-specific UTRAN and/or E-UTRAN information for cell re-selection. The presence of SI 23 messages shall be indicated in SI 22 message.

SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 19 messages shall be provided if COMPACT neighbour cells exist (see 3GPP TS 45.008). The presence of SI 19 messages shall be indicated in SI 9 message.

The support of GPRS shall be indicated in SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 3 message. In addition, the support of GPRS shall be indicated in either SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 4 or SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 7 and 8 messages. If GPRS is supported, SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 13 message shall be sent. SI 13 message shall not be sent if GPRS is not supported. Additional requirements for the broadcast of system information in a cell supporting GPRS are specified in 3GPP TS 44.060.

If EC-GSM-IoT is supported in the cell then EC SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 1, 2 and 3 messages are regularly broadcast by the network on the EC-BCCH. Based on this information a mobile station that has enabled EC operation able to decide whether and how it may gain access to the system via the current cell.

EC SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 4 message is optionally broadcast by the network if EC-GSM-IoT and network sharing is supported in the cell. The presence of EC SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 4 message shall be indicated in the EC SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 3 message.

  NOTE 1:	The allowed scheduling of SYSTEM INFORMATION messages on the BCCH and EC SYSTEM INFORMATION messages on the EC-BCCH are specified in 3GPP TS 45.002.

  NOTE 2:	The network should take into account limitations of certain mobile stations to understand SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 2bis, TYPE 2ter, the EXT-IND bit in the Neighbour Cell Description, the indication of 2ter in SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 3 and formats used in the Neighbour Cell Description IE and Cell Channel Description IE used in SYSTEM INFORMATION messages, see this sub-clause, sub-clause 10.5.2.1b, and sub-clause 10.5.2.22.

  NOTE 3:	The network should take into account the limitations of earlier versions of mobile equipment to understand the 3-digit MNC format of the location area identification, see sub-clause 10.5.1.3.

The information broadcast may be grouped in the following classes:

  -	information giving unique identification of the current network, location area and cell;

  -	information used for candidate cell measurements for handover and cell selection procedures;

  -	information describing the current control channel structure;

  -	information controlling the random access channel utilization;

  -	information defining different options supported within the cell; and

  -	information about the length of the part of the message belonging to the phase 1 protocol.

The network may send to the mobile station BCCH scheduling information as specified below:

  1)	The BCCH scheduling information may be contained in the SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 9 messages. If so, SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 3 specifies where to find SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 9 messages carrying BCCH scheduling information.

  2)	If the mobile station has received BCCH scheduling information, it shall assume that this BCCH scheduling information is valid in the location area until new scheduling information is received. It may store the information in the ME and assume its validity after switch on in the same location area.

  3)	The network need not indicate the schedule of all SYSTEM INFORMATION messages in SYSTEM INFORMATION 9. For any System Information message, the MS shall monitor all blocks specified in 3GPP TS 45.002 for that System Information message and all blocks specified in the SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 9 message for that System Information message.

  4)	When the mobile station detects that the BCCH information is not scheduled as defined in the last received SI 9 message, it shall read the SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 3 message. If presence of BCCH scheduling information in SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 9 message is indicated, it shall try to read the information and continue as in 2 above. If presence of BCCH scheduling information in SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 9 message is not indicated, it shall assume that there is no valid BCCH scheduling information.


3.2.2.2	Paging

The network is required to send valid layer 3 messages continuously on all paging subchannels on CCCH.


3.2.2.3	Sending of ETWS Primary Notification

The network initiates the delivery of an ETWS Primary Notification message (see 3GPP TS 23.041) by broadcasting the PAGING REQUEST TYPE 1 message on all paging subchannels on CCCH with the ETWS Primary Notification field present within the P1 Rest Octets IE. These paging messages are sent continuously during the ETWS warning period.

Each paging message carries a segment of the actual ETWS Primary Notification message, i.e. segmentation is applicable if an ETWS Primary Notification message is too large to fit into the P1 Rest Octets of a single PAGING REQUEST TYPE 1 message. In order to allow a mobile station to receive the segments in any order, the size of a specific segment (retransmitted during the ETWS warning period) shall not be altered. Segments belonging to the same ETWS Primary Notification message shall be given the same Primary Notification Identifier (PNI) value.


3.2.3	Inter-RAT cell re-selection based on priority information


3.2.3.1	General

The network may provide priority information to enable priority-based cell reselection (see 3GPP TS 45.008). Inter-RAT cell reselection based on priority information applies only in case of autonomous cell reselection.

Two sets of priorities are defined for inter-RAT cell re-selection based on priority information: common priorities (see sub-clause 3.2.3.2) and individual priorities (see sub-clause 3.2.3.3). The mobile station shall delete all priorities when switched off.

While providing common or individual priorities, the network shall ensure that the GERAN priority value is different from all E-UTRAN priority values and from all UTRAN priority values, and that all UTRAN priority values are different from all E-UTRAN priority values. In addition, if for some E-UTRAN frequencies THRESH_E-UTRAN_high_Q is provided in the Enhanced Cell Reselection Parameters Description IE in the SI2quater message or, if network sharing is supported by the network (see sub-clause 3.8), in the SI23 message, the network shall ensure that the priority value for any frequency for which THRESH_E-UTRAN_high_Q is provided is different from the priority value for all frequencies for which THRESH_E-UTRAN_high_Q is not provided.

The mobile station shall determine each set, considering only individual priorities (respectively common priorities) when building the set of individual (respectively common) priorities. The mobile station shall perform the following steps, in the specified order:

  -	If the same priority value is assigned to GERAN and to one or more UTRAN or E-UTRAN frequencies then all such UTRAN and E-UTRAN priority values are considered as not in the set of priorities.

  -	If the same priority value is assigned to one or more UTRAN frequencies and one or more E-UTRAN frequencies, then all such priority values are considered as not in the set of priorities.

  -	If the same priority value is assigned to one or more E-UTRAN frequencies for which THRESH_E-UTRAN_high_Q is provided and one or more E-UTRAN frequencies for which THRESH_E-UTRAN_high_Q is not provided then all such priority values are considered as not in the set of priorities.

  NOTE 1:	These steps mean that if, for example, there are two UTRAN priority values, one E-UTRAN priority value (for a frequency for which THRESH_E-UTRAN_high_Q is provided) and one E-UTRAN priority value (for a frequency for which THRESH_E-UTRAN_high_Q is not provided) that are all the same, then all four priority values are considered as not in the set of priorities.

A set of individual priorities is valid if it contains at least one priority.

A set of common priorities is valid if both of the following conditions are met:

  -	The set of priorities includes a priority for GERAN;

  -	The mobile station does not have a valid set of individual priorities.

If the mobile station has a valid set of priorities, the priorities in this set shall be used for priority-based reselection as specified in 3GPP TS 45.008.

  NOTE 2:  It is possible that individual priorities inherited from UTRAN or E-UTRAN (see sub-clause 3.2.3.3) do not contain a priority for GERAN.


3.2.3.2	Common priorities information

A mobile station may receive common priorities information in the Priority and E-UTRAN Parameters Description IE in the SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 2quater message.

A mobile station supporting network sharing may receive PLMN specific UTRAN and E-UTRAN common priorities in the SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 23 message. If the SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 23 message is broadcast in the cell, a mobile station supporting network sharing shall use only UTRAN and E-UTRAN common priorities if provided in this message.


3.2.3.3	Provision of individual priorities information

A mobile station shall store individual priorities information if received in the Individual Priorities IE in the CHANNEL RELEASE message, PACKET MEASUREMENT ORDER message or in the PACKET CELL CHANGE ORDER message (see 3GPP TS 44.060). If received in a PACKET CELL CHANGE ORDER message, the mobile station shall use the parameters provided in the Individual Priorities IE only upon successful completion of the network controlled cell reselection procedure as described in 3GPP TS 44.060.

If the T3230 timeout value is provided the mobile station shall set timer T3230 to the value received and start timer T3230 (or restart timer T3230 with the timeout value provided if already running).

If the Individual Priorities IE contains priorities for more than 16 UTRAN FDD frequencies, more than 16 UTRAN TDD frequencies, or more than 8 E-UTRAN frequencies, then the mobile station may ignore the contents of the Individual Priorities IE and, in this case, shall delete any stored individual priorities.

  NOTE:	Each signalled frequency is counted whether or not the mobile station supports that frequency.

Stored individual priorities shall be deleted by the mobile station when any of the following occurs:

  -	a PLMN selection is performed and results in a change of PLMN and the new PLMN is not an equivalent PLMN, see 3GPP TS 23.122; or

  -	the mobile station is switched off; or

  -	a CHANNEL RELEASE message, PACKET MEASUREMENT ORDER message or PACKET CELL CHANGE ORDER is received with an indication that the individual priorities shall be deleted; or

  -	new individual priorities are received ; or

  -	timer T3230 expires.

At inter-RAT cell reselection from UTRAN or E-UTRAN to GERAN or cell selection  or handover that results in a change of RAT from UTRAN or E-UTRAN to GERAN, the MS shall inherit individual priority information if the corresponding timer (T320 if the last serving RAT was E-UTRA; T322 if the last serving RAT was UTRA) has not expired. In this case the mobile station shall start timer T3230 with the timeout value set to the remaining validity time of the corresponding timer from the source RAT. If this inherited individual priority information includes more than one individual priority for GERAN frequencies, then the mobile station shall apply only the one applicable to the BCCH carrier of the first serving GERAN cell after the change of RAT as the individual priority for all GERAN cells for as long as the mobile station remains in GERAN. In this case the mobile station shall not apply the other GERAN individual priority(ies) until the MS leaves GERAN (see 3GPP TS 25.331, 3GPP TS 36.331).

  NOTE:	The network may provide individual priorities information for inter-RAT frequencies not configured by system information.


3.2.4	(void)


3.3	RR connection establishment


3.3.1	RR connection establishment initiated by the mobile station

The purpose of the immediate assignment procedure is to establish an RR connection between the mobile station and the network.

A MS that has enabled PEO or EC operation may optionally support mobile originated RR connection establishment for GSM services (see 3GPP TS 23.060 [74]). If it establishes a RR connection for GSM services then it shall disable GPRS services (see 3GPP TS 23.060 [74]) until the RR connection is released.


3.3.1.1	Entering the dedicated mode : immediate assignment procedure

The immediate assignment procedure can only be initiated by the RR entity of the mobile station. Initiation is triggered by request from the MM sublayer or LLC layer to enter the dedicated mode or by the RR entity in response to a PAGING REQUEST message, to initiate a notification response procedure or to initiate a priority uplink request procedure. Upon such a request:

  -	if access to the network is allowed (as defined in sub-clause 3.3.1.1.1), the RR entity of the mobile station initiates the immediate assignment procedure as defined in sub-clause 3.3.1.1.2;

  -	otherwise, it rejects the request.

The request from the MM sublayer to establish an RR connection specifies an establishment cause. Similarly, the request from the RR entity to establish a RR connection in response to a PAGING REQUEST 1, 2 or 3 message specifies one of the establishment causes "answer to paging"; the request from the RR entity to establish an RR connection in order to initiate a notification response procedure or a priority uplink request procedure specifies one of the establishment causes " procedures that can be completed with a SDCCH".


3.3.1.1.1	Permission to access the network

All mobile stations with an inserted SIM are members of one out of 10 access classes numbered 0 to 9. The access class number is stored in the SIM. In addition, mobile stations may be members of one or more out of 5 special access classes (access classes 11 to 15) (see 3GPP TS 22.011), this is also held on the SIM card.

The system information messages on the BCCH broadcast the list of authorized access classes and authorized special access classes, and whether emergency calls are allowed in the cell to all mobile stations or only to the members of authorized special access classes. When network sharing is in use in the cell (see sub-clause 3.8), this information may be broadcast individually for each of the PLMN sharing the cell, and may include different domain-specific access control information for the CS and PS domains.

A mobile station supporting network sharing shall determine whether or not access to the network is allowed using the applicable access control information corresponding to the selected PLMN. In addition, if domain-specific access control is used, a mobile station supporting domain-specific access control shall determine whether or not access to the network is allowed for the domain originating the access attempt, using the access control information corresponding to this domain.

A mobile station configured for EAB and has enabled EAB (i.e. it has received EAB Authorization Mask and EAB Subcategory information for its selected PLMN from SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 21) shall, prior to proceeding with a mobile originated access attempt, re-read SI21 if more than 30 seconds have expired since the last time it read SI21.

For a mobile originated access attempt, a mobile station configured for EAB and that has enabled EAB shall perform a preliminary access barring check (see sub-clause 3.3.1.4). If the preliminary access barring check indicates network access is barred then access to the network is not allowed. Otherwise, the mobile station shall proceed according to the remainder of this sub-clause.

If the establishment cause for the request of the MM sublayer is not "emergency call", access to the network is allowed if and only if the mobile station is a member of at least one authorized:

  -	access class; or

  -	special access class.

If the establishment cause for the request of the MM sublayer is "emergency call", access to the network is allowed if and only if:

  -	emergency calls are allowed to all mobile stations in the cell; or

  -	the mobile station is a member of at least one authorized special access class.


3.3.1.1.1a	Implicit reject indication from the network

The network may at any time include an implicit reject indication for the PS domain or the CS domain within an IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT message using the IA Rest Octets IE (see sub-clause 10.5.2.16) or within an IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT REJECT or an IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT EXTENDED or an IMMEDIATE PACKET ASSIGNMENT message using the Feature Indicator IE (see sub-clause 10.5.2.76) or within a PAGING REQUEST TYPE 1 message using the P1 Rest Octets IE (see sub-clause 10.5.2.23) or within a PAGING REQUEST TYPE 2 message using the P2 Rest Octets IE (see sub-clause 10.5.2.24) or within a PAGING REQUEST TYPE 3 message using the P3 Rest Octets IE (see sub-clause 10.5.2.25).

In addition, the network may at any time include an implicit reject indication for the PS domain or the CS domain within an EC IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT TYPE 1 message using the Feature Indicator IE (see sub-clause 10.5.2.76).


3.3.1.1.2	Initiation of the immediate assignment procedure

The RR entity of a mobile station, when attempting to establish a CS connection other than for an emergency call or for sending a paging response, and accessing the network when the low priority indicator is set to "MS is configured to NAS signalling low priority" (see 3GPP TS 24.008) shall, while ignoring MS identities included within PAGING REQUEST messages, start listening to the downlink CCCH until successfully decoding one of the RR messages listed in sub-clause 3.3.1.1.1a. If the RR message indicates an implicit reject for the CS domain (see sub-clause 3.3.1.1.1a) the mobile station shall abort the immediate assignment procedure and initiate the Implicit Reject procedure (see sub-clause 3.3.1.1.3.2a).

The RR entity of a mobile station initiates the immediate assignment procedure by scheduling the sending of CHANNEL REQUEST (or EGPRS PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST or EC PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST) messages on the RACH and leaving idle mode (in particular, the mobile station shall ignore PAGING REQUEST messages).

The mobile station then sends maximally M + 1 CHANNEL REQUEST (or EGPRS PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST or EC PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST) messages on the RACH in a way such that:

  -	when requesting resources for a PS connection other than in the case of sending a paging response, the mobile station shall send the first CHANNEL REQUEST (or EGPRS PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST or EC PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST) message in the first available TDMA frame belonging to the mobile station’s RACH.

  -	in all other cases, the number of slots belonging to the mobile station's RACH between initiation of the immediate assignment procedure and the first CHANNEL REQUEST (or EGPRS PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST or EC PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST message) (excluding the slot containing the message itself) is a random value drawn randomly for each new initial assignment initiation with uniform probability distribution in the set {0, 1, ..., max (T,8) - 1};

  -	the number of slots belonging to the mobile station's RACH between two successive CHANNEL REQUEST (or EGPRS PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST or EC PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST) messages (excluding the slots containing the messages themselves) is a random value drawn randomly for each new transmission with uniform probability distribution in the set
    {S, S + 1, ..., S + T - 1};

Here, T is the value of the parameter "Tx-integer" broadcast on the BCCH;

M is the value of the parameter "max retrans" broadcast on the BCCH;

S is a parameter depending on the CCCH configuration and on the value of Tx-integer as defined in table 3.3.1.1.2.1.

The CHANNEL REQUEST messages are sent on the RACH (cf. sub-clause 1.5) and contain as parameters:

  -	an establishment cause which corresponds to the establishment cause given by the MM sublayer and the broadcast NECI value, or which corresponds to one of the establishment causes "answer to paging" given by the RR entity in response to a PAGING REQUEST message including the Channel Needed information, or which corresponds to one of the establishment causes " procedures that can be completed with a SDCCH" given by the RR entity in order to initiate a notification response procedure or a priority uplink request procedure;

  -	a random reference which is drawn randomly from a uniform probability distribution for every new transmission.

After sending the first CHANNEL REQUEST message, the mobile station shall start listening to the BCCH; it shall also listen to the full downlink CCCH timeslot corresponding to its CCCH group.

A mobile station that has initiated the immediate assignment procedure other than for an emergency call or for sending a paging response, and that is accessing the network when the low priority indicator is set to "MS is configured to NAS signalling low priority" (see 3GPP TS 24.008), and has sent one or more CHANNEL REQUEST messages shall proceed as follows:

  -	If the mobile station receives an IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT, an IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT EXTENDED or an IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT REJECT message corresponding to one of its last 3 transmitted CHANNEL REQUEST messages it shall act on that message as described in sub-clause 3.3.1.1.3.

  -	If the mobile station succesfully decodes an RR message, which is not a response corresponding to one of its last 3 transmitted CHANNEL REQUEST, that indicates an implicit reject for the CS domain (see sub-clause 3.3.1.1.1a) it shall start timer T3126 (if not already running) and initiate the implicit reject procedure as described in sub-clause 3.3.1.1.3.2a.

Having sent M + 1 CHANNEL REQUEST messages, the RR entity of the mobile station starts timer T3126. At expiry of timer T3126, the immediate assignment procedure is aborted; if the immediate assignment procedure was triggered by a request from the MM sublayer, a random access failure is indicated to the MM sublayer.

3.3.1.1.3	Answer from the network


3.3.1.1.3.1	On receipt of a CHANNEL REQUEST message

The network may allocate a dedicated channel to the mobile station by sending an IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT message or IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT EXTENDED message in unacknowledged mode on the same CCCH timeslot on which it has received the CHANNEL REQUEST. There is no further restriction on what part of the downlink CCCH an IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT message or IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT EXTENDED message can be sent. The type of channel allocated (SDCCH or TCH; the channel mode shall be set to signalling only) is a network operator decision. Timer T3101 is then started on the network side.

  NOTE:	There are two types of immediate assignment messages:

         -	IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT message, containing assignment information for one mobile station only;

         -	IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT EXTENDED message, containing assignment information for two mobile stations at the same time.

The IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT or IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT EXTENDED message contains:

  -	the description of the assigned channel;

  -	the information field of the CHANNEL REQUEST message and the frame number of the frame in which the CHANNEL REQUEST message was received;

  -	the initial timing advance (cf. 3GPP TS 44.004);

  -	optionally, a starting time indication.

If frequency hopping is applied, the mobile station uses the last CA received on the BCCH to decode the Mobile Allocation.

On receipt of an IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT or IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT EXTENDED message corresponding to one of its 3 last CHANNEL REQUEST messages, the mobile station stops T3126 (if running), stops sending CHANNEL REQUEST messages, switches to the assigned channels, sets the channel mode to signalling only and activates the assigned channels. It then establishes the main signalling link with an SABM containing an information field (see sub-clause 3.1.5).

An IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT or IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT EXTENDED message may indicate a frequency change in progress, with a starting time and possibly alternative channel descriptions.

In the case of the reception of an IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT EXTENDED message, or of an IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT message which contains only the description of a channel to be used after the starting time, the mobile station shall wait up to the starting time before accessing the channel. If the starting time has already elapsed, the mobile shall access the channel as an immediate reaction to the reception of the message (see 3GPP TS 45.010 for the timing constraints).

If the message contains both the description of a channel to be used after the indicated time and of a channel to be used before, the mobile station accesses a channel as an immediate reaction to the reception of the message. If the moment the mobile station is ready to access is before the indicated time, the mobile station accesses the channels described for before the starting time. The mobile station then changes to the channel described for after the starting time at the indicated time. New parameters can be the mobile allocation and MAIO. Other parameters describing the channel to be used before the starting time are taken from the description of the channel defined for use after the starting time. If the moment the mobile station is ready to access is after the starting time, the mobile station accesses the channel described for after the starting time.

If frequency hopping is applied, the mobile station uses the last CA received on the BCCH.


3.3.1.1.3.2	Assignment rejection

If no channel is available for assignment, the network may send to the mobile station an IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT REJECT message in unacknowledged mode on the same CCCH timeslot on which the channel request message was received. There is no further restriction on what part of the downlink CCCH timeslot an IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT REJECT message can be sent. This message contains the request reference and a wait indication.

On receipt of an IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT REJECT message corresponding to one of its 3 last CHANNEL REQUEST messages, the mobile station, stops sending CHANNEL REQUEST messages, starts timer T3122 with the indicated value, ("wait indication" information element), starts T3126 if it has not already been started, and listens to the downlink CCCH until T3126 expires. During this time, additional IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT REJECT messages are ignored, but any immediate assignment corresponding to any other of its 3 last CHANNEL REQUEST messages make the mobile station follow the procedure in sub-clause 3.3.1.1.3.1. If no such immediate assignment is received, the mobile station returns to CCCH idle mode (listening to its paging channel).

As an option the mobile station may return to CCCH idle mode as soon as it has received responses from the network on all, or in case more than 3 were sent the last 3, of its CHANNEL REQUEST messages.

The mobile station is not allowed to make a new attempt to establish a non emergency RR connection in the same cell until T3122 expires. Provided that an IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT REJECT message has not been received for an emergency RR connection attempt, the mobile station may attempt to enter the dedicated mode for an emergency call in the same cell before T3122 has expired.

The Wait Indication IE (i.e. T3122) relates to the cell from which it was received.

The mobile station in packet idle mode (only applicable to mobile station supporting GPRS) may initiate packet access in the same cell before T3122 has expired, see 3GPP TS 44.060 and sub-clause 3.5.2.1.3.4.

After T3122 expiry, no CHANNEL REQUEST message shall be sent as a response to a page until a PAGING REQUEST message for the mobile station is received.


3.3.1.1.3.2a	Implicit Reject procedure

A mobile station for which timer T3126 or T3146 is running shall proceed as follows:

  -	While T3126 or T3146 is running, the mobile station listens to the downlink CCCH for a response from the network and is not allowed to make a new access attempt.

  -	If a response corresponding to any of the last 3 transmitted CHANNEL REQUEST or EGPRS PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST or EC PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST messages is received the mobile station shall stop T3126 or T3146 and act on that message as described in sub-clause 3.3.1.1.3 (if attempting a CS domain access) or as decribed in sub-clause 3.5.2.1.3 (if attempting a PS domain access).

  -	If T3126 or T3146 expires the mobile station proceeds according to the remainder of this sub-clause.

If the mobile station initiates this procedure due to implicit reject indication received for the CS domain (respectively PS domain) it starts timer T3234 (respectively timer T3236), returns to idle mode and monitors the CCCH. An exception case is where EC operation is enabled in which case the mobile station shall proceed as described in sub-clause 3.5.2a.2 when T3146 expires. The mobile station is not allowed to make a mobile originated access attempt when the low priority indicator is set to "MS is configured to NAS signalling low priority" (see 3GPP TS 24.008) for the CS domain (respectively PS domain) in the same cell until T3234 (respectively T3236) expires or is stopped.

If the mobile station receives a PAGING REQUEST message while T3234/T3236 is running it shall stop T3234/T3236 and respond to the PAGING REQUEST message.


3.3.1.1.4	Assignment completion

The immediate assignment procedure is terminated on the network side when the main signalling link is established. Timer T3101 is stopped and the MM sublayer on the network side is informed that the RR entity has entered the dedicated mode.

On the mobile station side, the procedure is terminated when the establishment of the main signalling link is confirmed. The MM sublayer is informed that the RR entity has entered the dedicated mode.

A DTM capable mobile station in GMM READY state shall perform a Cell Update procedure when it enters dedicated mode from packet idle mode in a cell that supports dual transfer mode. This can be done as early as possible after access but shall be done after sending a CLASSMARK CHANGE message.


3.3.1.1.4.1	Early classmark sending

Early classmark sending consists in the mobile station sending as early as possible after access a CLASSMARK CHANGE message to provide the network with additional classmark information. In addition an MS supporting UTRAN shall send a UTRAN CLASSMARK CHANGE message; an MS supporting CDMA2000 shall send a CDMA2000 CLASSMARK CHANGE message and an MS supporting GERAN Iu mode shall send a GERAN IU MODE CLASSMARK CHANGE message. When a CLASSMARK CHANGE message and one or more additional UTRAN CLASSMARK CHANGE or CDMA2000 CLASSMARK CHANGE or GERAN IU MODE CLASSMARK CHANGE messages are to be sent, the CLASSMARK CHANGE message shall be sent first.

A mobile station which implements the "Controlled Early Classmark Sending" option shall perform the early classmark sending if and only if it is accepted by the network, as indicated in the last reception in the accessed cell of the SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 3 message or the PACKET SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 2 message (3GPP TS 44.060). If the PACKET SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 2 messages have been received, but the Early Classmark Sending Control flag is not included, the mobile station may either read the SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 3 message or it shall assume that the early classmark sending is allowed in the cell.

A mobile station which implements support for multiple band shall also implement the "Controlled Early Classmark Sending" option.

A mobile station which implements the support of one or more 3G Radio Access Technology shall also implement the "Controlled Early Classmark Sending" option; in this case neither UTRAN CLASSMARK CHANGE, CDMA2000 CLASSMARK CHANGE nor GERAN IU MODE CLASSMARK CHANGE message shall be sent by the mobile if prohibited by the 3G Early Classmark Sending Restriction parameter in the last reception in the accessed cell of the SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 3 message or the PACKET SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 2 message (see 3GPP TS 44.060). If the PACKET SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 2 messages have been received, but the 3G Early Classmark Sending Restriction flag is not included, the mobile station shall assume neither UTRAN, CDMA2000 nor GERAN IU MODE CLASSMARK CHANGE message shall be sent with the Early Classmark Sending.

A mobile station which implements the "multislot capability" option shall also implement the "Controlled Early Classmark Sending" option.

A mobile station that implements some form of treatment of UCS2 alphabet (see 3GPP TS 23.038) encoded character string (e.g., in short message, or in USSD string) may indicate so in the classmark. (An example is a Mobile Equipment able to display UCS2 encoded character string.) In such a case, it should also implement the "Controlled Early Classmark Sending" option. It is the mobile station responsibility to provide the UCS2 support information in due time. If the network needs this information and the mobile station did not provide it, the network may assume that the Mobile Equipment does not support UCS2.

A mobile station which implements the R-GSM band (see 3GPP TS 45.005) shall also implement the "Controlled Early Classmark Sending" option.

A mobile station which implements the extended measurement function shall also implement the "Controlled Early Classmark Sending" option.

A mobile station which implements the "GPRS" option shall also implement the "Controlled Early Classmark Sending" option.

A mobile station which implements the "SoLSA" option shall also implement the "Controlled Early Classmark Sending" option.

A mobile station which implements the "EDGE" option shall also implement the "Controlled Early Classmark Sending" option.

A mobile station which implements the "LCS" option shall also implement the "Controlled Early Classmark Sending" option.

A mobile station that implements the GERAN Feature Package 2 (see 3GPP TS 24.008) shall also implement the "Controlled Early Classmark Sending" option.

A mobile station which implements the "VAMOS" option shall also implement the "Controlled Early Classmark Sending" option.

A mobile station that implements "Extended TSC sets" option (see 3GPP TS 24.008) shall also implement the "Controlled Early Classmark Sending" option.

A mobile station which implements the "Controlled Early Classmark Sending" option shall indicate it in the classmark (ES IND bit).


3.3.1.1.4.2	Service information sending

Service information sending consists in a mobile station in class A mode of operation sending a SERVICE INFORMATION message and in a mobile station in class B mode of operation sending a GPRS SUSPENSION REQUEST message, providing additional service information to the network.

A mobile station in class A mode of operation which supports the MBMS feature and requires notification of commencing MBMS sessions during dedicated mode operation, shall perform the service information sending procedure:

  -	at the earliest opportunity after the early Classmark sending procedure and any DTM related signalling, if and only if the dedicated mode MBMS notification feature is supported in the cell as indicated in the GPRS Cell Options (see 3GPP TS 44.060) or DTM INFORMATION message or System Information Type 6 message; or

  -	if the P-TMSI of the MS is reallocated during the CS connection and the dedicated mode MBMS notification feature is supported in the cell as indicated in the GPRS Cell Options (see 3GPP TS 44.060) or DTM INFORMATION message or System Information Type 6 message; or

  -	on the main DCCH of a target cell after successfully completing the handover procedure, if indicated to do so in the HANDOVER COMMAND message (see sub-clause 3.4.4.1) and the dedicated mode MBMS notification feature is supported in the target cell as indicated in the GPRS Cell Options (see 3GPP TS 44.060) or DTM INFORMATION message or System Information Type 6 message.


3.3.1.1.5	Abnormal cases

If a lower layer failure occurs on the mobile station side on the new channel before the successful establishment of the main signalling link, the allocated channels are released; the subsequent behaviour of the mobile station depends on the type of failure and previous actions.

  -	If the failure is due to information field mismatch in the contention resolution procedure, see sub-clause 3.1.5, and no repetition as described in this paragraph has been performed, the immediate assignment procedure shall be repeated.

  -	If the failure is due to any other reason or if a repetition triggered by a contention resolution failure has been performed. The mobile station returns to idle mode (RR connection establishment failure), transactions in progress are aborted and cell reselection then may take place.

If the information available in the mobile station, after the reception of an IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT message does not satisfactorily define a channel, an RR connection establishment failure has occurred.

If the Mobile Allocation IE indexes frequencies in more than one frequency band then a RR connection establishment failure has occurred.

If an IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT message indicates (a) channel(s) in a different frequency band to which the CHANNEL REQUEST message was sent then, if the frequency band is supported by the mobile station, the mobile station shall access the indicated channel(s) with the same power control level as used for the CHANNEL REQUEST message.

If an IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT message indicates a channel in non-supported frequency band then a RR connection establishment failure has occurred.

On the network side, if timer T3101 elapses before the main signalling link is established, the newly allocated channels are released and the request is forgotten. Note that the network has no means to distinguish repeated attempts from initial attempts from a mobile station.


3.3.1.2	Entering the group transmit mode: uplink access procedure

Only applicable for mobile stations supporting "VGCS transmit".

The purpose of the uplink control procedure is to establish an RR connection on a VGCS channel between a mobile station which is in group receive mode on that channel and the network.

The mobile station enters the group transmit mode when a successful establishment of the RR connection is indicated. The channel mode assumed by the mobile station is the one derived from the channel description.

When the network supports talker priority or sending application-specific data, it shall provide on the NCH in combination with the UPLINK_BUSY message on the group call channel downlink, the method that the MS shall use to issue priority talker requests.

  NOTE:	The only indication of support of talker priority by the network is the presence of the Talker Priority and Emergency Indication IE in the UPLINK BUSY message (see sub-clause 9.1.46.1).


3.3.1.2.1	Mobile station side


3.3.1.2.1.1	Uplink investigation procedure - talker priority not supported by the network

The mobile station in group receive mode shall consider the uplink as free if the last message indicating the uplink as being free was received less than 480 ms ago and if no UPLINK BUSY message has been received since the last message indicating the uplink as free.

On receipt of a request from the upper layer to access the uplink and if the uplink is not free, the mobile station starts the timer T3128.

If the uplink is free or becomes free before expiry of timer T3128, then the uplink investigation procedure is terminated, the mobile station shall stop T3128, and start the uplink access procedure.

  NOTE:	The start of the uplink access procedure is not subject to the access class of the mobile station.

If the uplink is not indicated free before the timer expires, the mobile station shall remain in the group receive mode and indicate a reject of the uplink request to the upper layer.


3.3.1.2.1.1a	Uplink investigation procedure - talker priority supported by the network

The mobile station in group receive mode shall consider the uplink as free if the last message indicating the uplink as being free was received less than 480 ms ago and if no UPLINK BUSY message has been received since the last message indicating the uplink as free.

On receipt of a privilege, emergency priority or emergency reset request from the upper layer to access the uplink, the mobile station shall verify that the requested priority is permitted according to the SIM/USIM. If the mobile station is not permitted to use the requested talker priority then it shall indicate a rejection of the uplink request to the upper layers.

On receipt of a request from the upper layer to access the uplink and if the uplink is busy with a priority equal or higher than the requested priority, the mobile station starts the timer T3128.

If the uplink is free, becomes free before expiry of timer T3128 or the current talker priority is less than the priority of the request from the upper layer, then the uplink investigation procedure is terminated, the mobile station shall stop T3128 if running, and start the uplink access. If the uplink is busy, the MS shall determine whether to start the uplink access or priority uplink request procedure based on the priority uplink access parameter broadcast on the NCH and the uplink access indication in the latest UPLINK BUSY message received in the cell.

If the priority uplink access parameter broadcast on the NCH indicates "RACH access" but the latest UPLINK BUSY message received in the cell indicates that the voice group call channel is available for uplink access requests, the MS shall start an uplink access procedure; otherwise the MS starts the priority uplink request procedure.

If the priority uplink access parameter broadcast on the NCH indicates "Group Channel" then the MS always shall start an uplink access procedure.

  NOTE:	The start of the uplink access procedure is not subject to the access class of the mobile station.

If the mobile station is unable to start the uplink access or priority uplink request procedure before timer T3128 expires, the mobile station shall remain in the group receive mode and indicate a reject of the uplink request to the upper layer.


3.3.1.2.1.2	Uplink access procedure with talker priority not supported by the network

The mobile station shall send UPLINK ACCESS messages on the voice group call channel with the appropriate establishment cause. These messages shall be sent unciphered. The first UPLINK ACCESS message shall be transmitted by the mobile station with a random delay between 0 and 20 ms.

Having sent the first UPLINK ACCESS message, the mobile station starts timer T3130. The mobile station shall send the UPLINK ACCESS message repeatedly with an interval of 100ms plus a random delay between 0 and 20 ms up to five times. At expiry of timer T3130, the mobile station shall repeat the same procedure if the uplink is free. Timer T3130 may be started a maximum of 3 times. On expiry of timer T3130 for the third time a rejection of the uplink request is indicated to the upper layers.

The UPLINK ACCESS messages contain a random reference which is drawn randomly from a uniform probability distribution. The UPLINK ACCESS messages repetitions shall contain the same random reference as the one contained in the first message.

If an uplink identity code (UIC) of the current cell has been provided by the network in the UPLINK FREE message, the mobile station shall use this UIC IE for the coding of the UPLINK ACCESS messages (see 3GPP TS 45.003). If no UIC is provided, the mobile station shall use the BSIC received from the current cell, for instance from the initial synchronization.

If no VGCS UPLINK GRANT or UPLINK BUSY message is received by the mobile station 480 ms after having sent the first UPLINK ACCESS message, the mobile station shall stop sending UPLINK ACCESS messages and wait in order to receive a VGCS UPLINK GRANT or UPLINK BUSY message.

On receipt of a VGCS UPLINK GRANT message corresponding to one of its UPLINK ACCESS messages, the mobile station stops T3130, stops sending UPLINK ACCESS messages, and establishes the main signalling link with an SABM containing the TALKER INDICATION message in the information field. The ciphering key sequence number shall be included in the TALKER INDICATION message if the group call is ciphered. Early classmark sending shall be performed if applicable. If a UA is received containing the message sent, the mobile station enters the group transmit mode and indicates the successful seizure of the uplink to the upper layer. If a UA is received with a message different from the message sent, the mobile station shall remain in the group receive mode and indicate the rejection of the uplink request to the upper layers.

On receipt of a VGCS_UPLINK_GRANT message aimed to another mobile station (i.e. not corresponding to one of its UPLINK ACCESS messages sent for this uplink request), the mobile station shall stop timer T3130 and shall not send UPLINK ACCESS message and shall start timer T3224. If the mobile station receive an UPLINK BUSY message before timer T3224 expires, it shall stop timer T3224 and remain in the group receive mode and shall indicate a rejection of the uplink request to the upper layers. Otherwise it shall follow the same procedures as for expiry of timer T3130.

When receiving an UPLINK BUSY message, the mobile station stops T3130 and stops sending UPLINK ACCESS messages. The mobile shall remain in the group receive mode and shall indicate a rejection of the uplink request to the upper layers.


3.3.1.2.1.2a	Uplink access procedure - with talker priority supported by the network using uplink access procedure


3.3.1.2.1.2a.1	Talker priority normal, privileged or emergency

The mobile station shall send UPLINK ACCESS messages on the voice group call channel with the appropriate establishment cause. These messages shall be sent unciphered. The first UPLINK ACCESS message shall be transmitted by the mobile station with a random delay between 0 and 20 ms.

Having sent the first UPLINK ACCESS message, the mobile station starts timer T3130. The mobile station shall send the UPLINK ACCESS message repeatedly up to five times. The interval between two sequential messages shall be 100ms plus a random delay between 0 and 20ms if the priority of the current uplink access is normal, or 80ms plus a random delay between 0 and 20ms if the priority of the current uplink access is privileged or emergency. At expiry of timer T3130, the mobile station shall repeat the same procedure if the uplink is free or the current talker priority is less than that of this uplink request. Timer T3130 may be started a maximum of 3 times. On expiry of timer T3130 for the third time a rejection of the uplink request is indicated to the upper layers.

The UPLINK ACCESS messages contain a random reference which is drawn randomly from a uniform probability distribution. The UPLINK ACCESS messages repetitions shall contain the same random reference as the one contained in the first message.

If an uplink identity code (UIC) of the current cell has been provided by the network in the UPLINK FREE message, the mobile station shall use this UIC IE for the coding of the UPLINK ACCESS messages (see 3GPP TS 45.003). If no UIC is provided, the mobile station shall use the BSIC received from the current cell, for instance from the initial synchronization.

If no VGCS UPLINK GRANT or UPLINK BUSY message is received by the mobile station 480 ms after having sent the first UPLINK ACCESS message for this uplink request, the mobile station shall stop sending UPLINK ACCESS messages and wait in order to receive a VGCS UPLINK GRANT or UPLINK BUSY message.

On receipt of a VGCS UPLINK GRANT message corresponding to one of its UPLINK ACCESS messages, the mobile station stops T3130, stops sending UPLINK ACCESS messages, and establishes the main signalling link with an SABM/UA exchange containing the TALKER INDICATION message in the information field, as described in sub-clause 3.3.1.2.1.2.2.

On receipt of a VGCS_UPLINK_GRANT message aimed to another mobile station (i.e. not corresponding to one of its UPLINK ACCESS messages sent for this uplink request), the mobile station shall stop timer T3130 and shall not send UPLINK ACCESS message and shall start timer T3224. If an UPLINK BUSY message is received before timer T3224 expires, the mobile station shall stop the timer. If the UPLINK BUSY message indicates a priority lower than the priority of the current uplink access, the mobile station shall resend the UPLINK_ACCESS message, otherwise, it shall remain in the group receive mode and shall indicate a rejection of the uplink request to the upper layers. If timer T3224 expires, the mobile station shall follow the same procedures as for expiry of timer T3130.

When receiving an UPLINK BUSY message indicating a priority that is equal or higher than the priority of the current uplink access, the mobile station stops T3130 and stops sending UPLINK ACCESS messages for this uplink request. The mobile shall remain in the group receive mode and shall indicate a rejection of the uplink request to the upper layers.

When receiving an UPLINK BUSY message indicating that the voice group call channel is not available for uplink access requests the mobile station stops T3130, stops sending UPLINK ACCESS messages and initiates the priority uplink request procedure.

When receiving an UPLINK RELEASE message during RR connection establishment on the group channel, the mobile station shall remain in the group receive mode and shall indicate a rejection of the uplink request to the upper layers.


3.3.1.2.1.2a.2	Emergency mode reset request

The mobile station shall send UPLINK ACCESS messages on the voice group call channel with the appropriate establishment cause. These messages shall be sent unciphered. The first UPLINK ACCESS message shall be transmitted by the mobile station with a random delay between 0 and 20 ms.

Having sent the first UPLINK ACCESS message, the mobile station starts timer T3130. The mobile station shall send the UPLINK ACCESS message repeatedly up to five times. The interval between two sequential messages shall be 80ms plus a random delay between 0 and 20ms. At expiry of timer T3130, the mobile station shall repeat the same procedure if the emergency mode is still set. Timer T3130 may be started a maximum of 3 times. On expiry of timer T3130 for the third time a rejection of the uplink request is indicated to the upper layers.

The UPLINK ACCESS messages contain a random reference which is drawn randomly from a uniform probability distribution. The UPLINK ACCESS messages repetitions shall contain the same random reference as the one contained in the first message.

If an uplink identity code (UIC) of the current cell has been provided by the network in the UPLINK FREE message, the mobile station shall use this UIC IE for the coding of the UPLINK ACCESS messages (see 3GPP TS 45.003). If no UIC is provided, the mobile station shall use the BSIC received from the current cell, for instance from the initial synchronization.

When receiving an UPLINK BUSY message indicating that the voice group call channel is not available for uplink access requests the mobile station stops T3130, stops sending UPLINK ACCESS messages for this uplink request and initiates the priority uplink request procedure.

On receipt of an VGCS UPLINK GRANT message corresponding to one of its UPLINK ACCESS messages for the current uplink access, the mobile station stops T3130, stops sending additional UPLINK ACCESS messages for this UPLINK REQUEST, and establishes the main signalling link with an SABM/UA exchange containing the TALKER INDICATION message in the information field, as described in 3.3.1.2.1.2.2.

When receiving an UPLINK BUSY or UPLINK FREE message indicating that the emergency mode is not set or a VGCS UPLINK GRANT message aimed to another mobile station (i.e. not corresponding to one of its UPLINK ACCESS messages sent for this uplink request), the mobile station stops T3130 and stops sending additional UPLINK ACCESS messages for this uplink request. The mobile shall remain in the group receive mode and shall indicate a rejection of the uplink request to the upper layers if the emergency mode is still set.

When receiving an UPLINK RELEASE message during RR connection establishment on the group channel, the mobile station shall remain in the group receive mode and shall indicate a rejection of the uplink request to the upper layers.


3.3.1.2.1.2b	Priority uplink request procedure


3.3.1.2.1.2b.1	Talker priority privileged or emergency

The mobile station shall temporarily leave group receive mode and initiate the immediate assignment procedure, as specified in 3.3.1.1. The mobile station shall store for comparison purposes the frame number of the frame in which the CHANNEL REQUEST message was sent to initiate the Priority Uplink access. The establishment of a signalling link is then initiated by use of a SABM, with information field containing the PRIORITY UPLINK REQUEST message (see subclause 3.1.5). The mobile identity, reduced group call reference, random reference and the type of request shall be included in the PRIORITY UPLINK REQUEST message. Once a UA is received from the network, containing the message sent, the mobile station waits for the signalling link to be released. On receipt of a CHANNEL RELEASE message (with the group channel description) the mobile station sends a DISCONNECT message to the network, returns to group receive mode, and starts T3130.

On receipt of a VGCS UPLINK GRANT message with request reference corresponding to the random reference and frame number stored in the MS, the mobile station stops T3130, and establishes the main signalling link with a SABM/ UA exchange containing the TALKER INDICATION message in the information field. The ciphering key sequence number shall be included in the TALKER INDICATION message. Early classmark sending shall be performed if applicable. If a UA is received containing the message sent, the mobile station enters the group transmit mode and indicates the successful seizure of the uplink to the upper layer. If a UA is received with a message different from the message sent, the mobile station shall remain in the group receive mode and indicate the rejection of the uplink request to the upper layers.

On receipt of a VGCS_UPLINK_GRANT message aimed to another mobile station (i.e. not corresponding to the random reference and frame number stored in the MS), the mobile station shall stop timer T3130 and start timer T3224. If an UPLINK BUSY message is received before timer T3224 expires, the mobile station shall stop the timer. If the UPLINK BUSY message indicates a priority lower than the priority of the current priority uplink request, the mobile station shall resend the PRIORITY UPLINK REQUEST message, otherwise, it shall remain in the group receive mode and shall indicate a rejection of the priority uplink request to the upper layers. If timer T3224 expires, the mobile station shall follow the same procedures as for expiry of timer T3130.

When receiving an UPLINK BUSY message indicating a priority that is equal or higher than the priority of the current priority uplink request, the mobile station stops T3130. The mobile shall remain in the group receive mode and shall indicate a rejection of the priority uplink request to the upper layers.

At expiry of timer T3130, the mobile station shall repeat the same procedure if the current talker priority is less than that of the requested priority, use the uplink access procedure if the uplink is free or use the uplink access procedure if the latest UPLINK BUSY message received in the cell indicates that the voice group call channel is available for uplink access requests. A maximum of three attempts is allowed and after that a rejection of the priority uplink request is indicated to the upper layers.


3.3.1.2.1.2b.2	Emergency mode reset request

The mobile station shall temporarily leave the group receive mode and initiate the immediate assignment procedure, as specified in 3.3.1.1. The establishment of a signalling link is then initiated by use of a SABM, with information field containing the PRIORITY UPLINK REQUEST message with cause Reset Emergency Talker Indication (see subclause 3.1.5). The mobile identity, reduced group call reference, and random reference shall be included in the PRIORITY UPLINK message. Once a UA is received from the network, containing the message sent, the mobile station waits for the signalling link to be released. On receipt of a CHANNEL RELEASE message (with the group channel description) the mobile station sends a DISCONNECT to the network and returns to group receive mode.


3.3.1.2.1.2b.3	Validation of priority uplink requests for ciphered voice group calls

When validation of priority uplink requests is required by the operator, the MS shall store the token received from the network in UPLINK BUSY and periodic UPLINK BUSY messages on the main signalling link. When a listener sends a PRIORITY UPLINK REQUEST message, the MS shall include the token as a parameter and follow the procedures specified in 3.3.1.2.1.2b.1 and 3.3.1.2.1.2b.2.

The MS shall always use the latest available token.

If an UPLINK BUSY message is received with a new token and a priority that is less than that of a MSs outstanding priority uplink request, the mobile station shall stop T3130, temporarily leave the group receive mode in order to resend the PRIORITY UPLINK REQUEST with the new token and return to the group receive mode to wait for the VGCS UPLINK GRANT message.

If at expiry of T3130 the uplink is still busy and the mobile station repeats the priority uplink request procedure, the MS shall use a different token, if available.


3.3.1.2.1.2c	Uplink access procedure for sending application-specific data


3.3.1.2.1.2c.1	General

The transmission of application-specific data by the mobile station in group receive mode to the network is carried out by the mobile temporarily leaving group receive mode, establishing a L2 connection and sending a L3 message containing the application-specific data in the SABM frame used to establish the main signalling link on a dedicated channel. The dedicated channel may be either the group call channel or another channel assigned by the network.


3.3.1.2.1.2c.2	Using the Voice Group Call Channel

If an UPLINK FREE message has been received and no subsequent UPLINK BUSY message has been received, or the last UPLINK BUSY message received in the cell indicates that the group channel shall be used to send application-specific data, the mobile station shall send UPLINK ACCESS messages on the voice group call channel with the establishment cause "UL request for sending application-specific data" to request a L2 connection. The mobile station shall then wait for a VGCS UPLINK GRANT message. When the VGCS UPLINK GRANT message is received by the mobile station, it establishes the main signalling link by sending a SABM command containing a DATA INDICATION message in the information field (see sub-clause 3.1.5).

Once contention resolution is complete, no further data shall be transmitted by the mobile station on the dedicated channel.. On receipt of an UPLINK RELEASE message, the MS returns to group receive mode.


3.3.1.2.1.2c.3	Using the RACH

If the most recent UPLINK BUSY message received in the cell indicates that RACH Access shall be used (and no UPLINK FREE message has been received more recently), the mobile station shall temporarily leave group receive mode and send a CHANNEL REQUEST message on the RACH with the appropriate establishment cause (see sub-clause 9.1.8). On receipt of an IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT, the main signalling link is then established as specified in 3.1.5 by use of a SABM with information field containing the DATA INDICATION 2 message.

Once contention resolution is complete, no further data shall be transmitted by the mobile station on the dedicated channel. On receipt of an CHANNEL RELEASE message, the mobile station returns to group receive mode.


3.3.1.2.2	Network side - talker priority not supported by the network

On receipt of an UPLINK ACCESS message the network shall perform, if necessary, contention resolution and grant the uplink to one mobile station by sending a VGCS UPLINK GRANT message to the mobile station in unacknowledged mode on the main signalling link. Furthermore, the network shall provide UPLINK BUSY messages on the main signalling link in all cells of the group call area. After having sent the first message, the network starts T3115. If the timer expires before the reception of a correctly decoded frame from the MS, the network repeats the VGCS UPLINK GRANT message to the mobile station, reset and restarts timer T3115. If the VGCS UPLINK GRANT message has been repeated Ny2 times without a correctly decoded frame being received from the MS, the network shall stop sending VGCS UPLINK GRANT messages and provide an UPLINK FREE message on the main signalling channel and wait for a new UPLINK ACCESS message. The correct decoding of a frame means that the decoding algorithm and the error detection tests, if any, indicate no error.

After the data link layer is established, the RR entity of the network shall analyse the TALKER INDICATION message received from the mobile station, adapt the RR procedures to the new classmark if necessary and provide the mobile subscriber identity and ciphering key sequence number to the upper layer.


3.3.1.2.2a	Network side - network supports talker priority using uplink access procedure


3.3.1.2.2a.1	Uplink FREE


3.3.1.2.2a.1.1	Uplink Access cause - Normal, Privileged, or Emergency priority request

As per sub-clause 3.3.1.2.2, with the following exceptions:

  -	The UPLINK BUSY message shall contain the priority of the uplink request;

  -	The UPLINK BUSY message shall be transmitted every T3151 seconds;

  -	In the case of an uplink request with priority set to emergency that is accepted by the network (see 3GPP TS 48.008), the emergency indication shall be set in all UPLINK BUSY messages.

  -	The UPLINK BUSY message shall contain the Uplink Access Indication IE to inform the mobile station of the channel to be used in the cell for priority uplink access. If "RACH Access" is indicated on the NCH and the group call channel uplink in the cell is not used, the network shall indicate "Group Channel" in the UPLINK BUSY message; otherwise, the network shall indicate "RACH Access" in the UPLINK BUSY message.


3.3.1.2.2a.1.2	Uplink Access cause - Emergency mode reset request

On receipt of an UPLINK ACCESS message with cause Emergency mode reset request when the emergency mode is set, the network shall perform, if necessary, contention resolution and grant the uplink to one mobile station by sending a VGCS UPLINK GRANT message to the mobile station in unacknowledged mode on the main signalling link. After having sent the first message, the network starts T3115. If the timer expires before the reception of a correctly decoded frame from the MS, the network repeats the VGCS UPLINK GRANT message to the mobile station, reset and restarts timer T3115. If the VGCS UPLINK GRANT message has been repeated Ny2 times without a correctly decoded frame being received from the MS, the network shall stop sending VGCS UPLINK GRANT messages and wait for a new UPLINK ACCESS message. The correct decoding of a frame means that the decoding algorithm and the error detection tests, if any, indicate no error.

After the data link layer is established, the RR entity of the network shall analyse the TALKER INDICATION message received from the mobile station. The mobile subscriber identity is provided to the upper layer. The network shall then send an UPLINK RELEASE message to the mobile station.

If emergency mode is not set within the network then the network discards the Emergency mode reset request.


3.3.1.2.2a.2	Uplink BUSY


3.3.1.2.2a.2.1	Uplink Access with cause priority less than or equal to current talker priority

The Uplink Access request shall be discarded.


3.3.1.2.2a.2.2	Uplink Access with cause priority higher than current talker priority

On receipt of an UPLINK ACCESS message the network shall perform, if necessary, contention resolution and grant the uplink of the voice group channel to one mobile station by sending a VGCS UPLINK GRANT message to the mobile station in unacknowledged mode on the main signalling link.

After having sent the first message, the network starts T3115. If the timer expires before the reception of a correctly decoded frame from the MS, the network repeats the VGCS UPLINK GRANT message to the mobile station, reset and restarts timer T3115. If the VGCS UPLINK GRANT message has been repeated Ny2 times without a correctly decoded frame being received from the MS, the network shall stop sending VGCS UPLINK GRANT messages. The correct decoding of a frame means that the decoding algorithm and the error detection tests, if any, indicate no error.

After the data link layer is established, the RR entity of the network shall analyse the TALKER INDICATION message received from the mobile station, adapt the RR procedures to the new classmark if necessary and provide the mobile subscriber identity and ciphering key sequence number to the upper layer.

The network shall provide UPLINK BUSY messages on the main signalling link in all cells of the group call area, containing the latest validated priority. The UPLINK BUSY message shall be transmitted every T3151 seconds.


3.3.1.2.2a.2.3	Uplink Access with cause Emergency mode reset request

As per sub-clause 3.3.1.2.2a.1.2, with the following exception:

  -	If the emergency mode reset request is accepted by the network (see 3GPP TS 48.008), the network shall provide UPLINK BUSY messages, with the emergency mode not set and the priority set to normal, on the main signalling link in all of the cells of the group call area. These UPLINK BUSY messages shall be transmitted every T3151 seconds.


3.3.1.2.2b	Network side - network supports talker priority using priority uplink procedure


3.3.1.2.2b.1	Uplink FREE


3.3.1.2.2b.1.1	Uplink Access cause - Normal, Privileged, or Emergency priority request

As per sub-clause 3.3.1.2.2, with the exception that the UPLINK BUSY messages are transmitted every T3151 seconds.


3.3.1.2.2b.1.2	Uplink Access cause - Emergency mode reset request

As per subclause 3.3.1.2.2a.1.2.


3.3.1.2.2b.2	Uplink BUSY


3.3.1.2.2b.2.1	Priority Uplink Request with cause priority less than or equal to current talker priority

The Priority Uplink Request shall be discarded.


3.3.1.2.2b.2.2	Priority Uplink Request with cause priority higher than current talker priority

On receipt of a priority uplink request message the network stops timer T3101 and releases the dedicated signalling link established by the MS. The RR entity of the network shall analyse the message and provide the message parameters to the upper layer. The network shall perform contention resolution, if necessary. The network shall release the current talker and grant the uplink to one mobile station by sending a VGCS UPLINK GRANT message to the mobile station in unacknowledged mode on the main signalling link. The VGCS UPLINK GRANT shall contain the request reference parameter with the random reference set to the value received in the PRIORITY UPLINK REQUEST and the frame number of the frame in which the CHANNEL REQUEST message was sent to establish the dedicated signalling link.

After having sent the first message, the network starts T3115. If the timer expires before the reception of a correctly decoded frame from the MS, the network repeats the VGCS UPLINK GRANT message to the mobile station, reset and restarts timer T3115. If the VGCS UPLINK GRANT message has been repeated Ny2 times without a correctly decoded frame being received from the MS, the network shall stop sending VGCS UPLINK GRANT messages. The correct decoding of a frame means that the decoding algorithm and the error detection tests, if any, indicate no error.

After the data link layer is established, the RR entity of the network shall analyse the TALKER INDICATION message received from the mobile station, adapt the RR procedures to the new classmark if necessary and provide the mobile subscriber identity and ciphering key sequence number to the upper layer.

The network shall provide UPLINK BUSY messages on the main signalling link in all cells of the group call area, containing the latest validated priority. The UPLINK BUSY message shall be transmitted every T3151 seconds.


3.3.1.2.2b.2.3	Priority Uplink Request with cause Emergency mode reset request

On receipt of a PRIORITY UPLINK REQUEST message with cause Reset Emergency Talker Indication the network stops timer T3101 and releases the dedicated signalling link established by the MS. The RR entity of the network shall analyse the message and provide the message parameters to the upper layer. The network shall perform contention resolution, if necessary, and reset the Emergency Indication of the group call. The current talker is not released.


3.3.1.2.2b.2.4	Validation of Priority Uplink Requests for ciphered voice group calls

When validation of priority uplink requests is required by the operator, the network shall broadcast a randomly generated 32bit token in an UPLINK BUSY message each time the uplink becomes busy after being free. The 32bit token is randomly generated on a per BSS basis. A new token shall subsequently be broadcast each time a periodic UPLINK BUSY message is sent (i.e. every T3151 seconds). If, on T3151 expiry, the old token has not been used it remains valid for a further T3157 seconds along with the new token. Once T3157 expires only the new token is valid.

On receipt of a priority uplink request message the network stops timer T3101 and releases the dedicated signalling link established by the MS. The RR entity of the network shall analyse the message and if a token is received in the message and it matches that stored in the network, the network shall provide the message parameters to the upper layer and continue handling the request as defined in 3.3.1.2.2b.2.2 and 3.3.1.2.2b.2.3. In addition, a new token and the priority of the accepted request is broadcast in an UPLINK BUSY message on the main signalling link after T3155 seconds and T3151 is reset and restarted. If a token is not received in the message, or the token received does not match that stored in the network, the network shall ignore the request.

The dedicated signalling link established by the MS is always acknowledged and released by sending UA (Priority Uplink Request) followed by Channel Release, whether or not the network accepts or ignores the request.


3.3.1.2.2c	Network side – network supports sending application-specific data by mobile station


3.3.1.2.2c.1	General

The transmission of application-specific data by the mobile station in group receive mode to the network is carried out by the mobile temporarily leaving group receive mode, establishing a L2 connection and sending a L3 message containing the application-specific data in the SABM frame used to establish the main signalling link on a dedicated channel. The dedicated channel may be either the group call channel or another channel assigned by the network.

The network shall send UPLINK BUSY messages every T3151 seconds in all cells in the group call area while the uplink for this group call is busy in any cell.

The mobile station behaviour is described in sub-clause 3.3.1.2.1.2c.


3.3.1.2.2c.2	Using the Voice Group Call Channel

On receipt of an UPLINK ACCESS message on the voice group call channel indicating a cause "UL request for sending application-specific data" the network shall grant the uplink of the voice group channel by sending a VGCS UPLINK GRANT message to the mobile station in unacknowledged mode on the main signalling link. After the data link layer is established (see sub-clauses 3.3.1.2.1.2c.2 and 3.1.5) the BSS releases the uplink channel by sending an UPLINK RELEASE message.


3.3.1.2.2c.3	Using the RACH

On receipt of a CHANNEL REQUEST message with the appropriate establishment cause for sending application-specific data (see sub-clause 9.1.8), the BSS shall allocate a channel to the mobile station by sending an IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT message. As soon as contention resolution is completed (see sub-clause 3.1.5 and 3.3.1.2.1.2c.3) and the data link layer is established, the BSS sends an CHANNEL RELEASE message to the mobile.


3.3.1.2.3	Abnormal cases

If a lower link failure has occurred or an indication of the release of the data link layer was provided by the lower layer and no RR release request was previously received from the upper layer, the network shall provide an UPLINK FREE message on the main signalling channel and wait for a new UPLINK ACCESS message.

The network shall discard an UPLINK ACCESS message or PRIORITY UPLINK REQUEST message that contains an unknown cause field.


3.3.1.3	Dedicated mode and GPRS

A mobile station whose Channel Request message contained a packet access establishment cause may receive an Immediate Assignment message to a Channel which is to be used in dedicated mode. A mobile station supporting the "GPRS" option shall not obey this command.


3.3.1.4	Preliminary Access Barring Check

The preliminary access barring check shall indicate network access is barred if all of the following conditions are satisfied:

  -	the establishment cause for the request received from the MM sublayer is not "emergency call".

  -	the SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 21 message is broadcast in the cell and includes EAB information;

  -	the mobile station is a member of a subcategory of mobile stations targeted by the EAB information;

  -	the EAB Authorization Mask sent in the EAB information indicates the mobile station’s access class is not authorized;

  -	the mobile station is not a member of any of the authorized special access classes (i.e. an Access Class in the range 11-15) permitted by the network;

Otherwise, the preliminary access barring check shall indicate network access is not barred.

When network sharing is in use in the cell, a mobile station supporting network sharing shall check the above conditions using the broadcast information corresponding to the selected PLMN.


3.3.2	Paging procedure for RR connection establishment

The network can initiate the establishment of an RR connection by the paging procedure for RR connection establishment. Such a procedure can only be initiated by the network.


3.3.2.1	Paging initiation by the network

The network initiates the paging procedure to trigger RR connection establishment by broadcasting a paging request message on the appropriate paging subchannel on CCCH or PCCCH, and starts timer T3113. The paging subchannels on CCCH and PCCCH are specified in 3GPP TS 45.002 and 3GPP TS 43.013.

The network may also send paging related information on PACCH to a mobile station in packet transfer mode, see sub-clause 3.3.2.1.3.

The network may also broadcast paging related information on any voice broadcast or voice group call channel downlink. The network shall indicate in the Notification/FACCH message sent on the voice broadcast or voice group call channel whether the paging is for a mobile terminating call, USSD or short message, if such information was provided to the BSS by the MSC in the Paging Information IE (see 3GPP TS 48.008).


3.3.2.1.1	Paging initiation using paging subchannel on CCCH

Paging initiation using the paging subchannel on CCCH is used when sending paging information to a mobile station in idle mode. It is also used when sending paging information to a mobile station in packet idle mode, if PCCCH is not present in the cell.

  NOTE 1:	There are 3 types of paging messages which may be used on CCCH:

         -	PAGING REQUEST TYPE 1;

         -	PAGING REQUEST TYPE 2; and

         -	PAGING REQUEST TYPE 3.

In a PAGING REQUEST message on CCCH to trigger RR connection establishment, the mobile station shall be identified by the TMSI (non-GPRS TMSI) or its IMSI. If the mobile station is identified by the TMSI, it shall proceed as specified in sub-clause 3.3.2.2.

If the mobile station in packet idle mode is identified by its IMSI, it shall parse the message for a corresponding Packet Page Indication field:

  -	if the Packet Page Indication field indicates a paging procedure for RR connection establishment, or the field is not present in the message, the mobile station shall proceed as specified in sub-clause 3.3.2.2;

  -	if the Packet Page Indication field indicates a packet paging procedure, the mobile station shall proceed as specified in sub-clause 3.5.1.2.

A PAGING REQUEST message on CCCH includes for each mobile station that is paged to trigger RR connection establishment an indication which defines how mobiles of different capabilities shall code the establishment cause field in the CHANNEL REQUEST message. The information received in the CHANNEL REQUEST can be used by the network to assign a suitable channel.

A PAGING REQUEST message on CCCH may include more than one mobile station identification.

A PAGING REQUEST TYPE 1 message on CCCH may have additionally a notification message coded in the P1 rest octets information element. The notification for one group call may be segmented over two PCH blocks. When the notification is segmented over two PCH blocks the second segment shall be sent at the next but one PCH block after the PCH block containing the first segment. The mobile station may receive the second segment before the first segment.

A PAGING REQUEST message on CCCH may also include priority levels related to the mobile station identifications. A mobile station in group receive mode supporting eMLPP shall take into account this information to decide whether to respond to this PAGING REQUEST and, if the call is answered, the mobile station shall store the priority level for the duration of the call. A mobile station not supporting eMLPP shall ignore this information element when received in a PAGING REQUEST message.

  NOTE 2:	A mobile station not supporting VGCS or VBS may ignore this information element when received in a PAGING REQUEST message, since the priority level is also provided in the SETUP message.

If VGCS or VBS is supported by the network, messages sent on the PCH may also include an indication of the change of the information sent on the NCH (see sub-clause 3.3.3.2).

The choice of the message type depends on the number of mobile stations to be paged and of the types of identities that are used. The maximum number of paged mobile stations per message is 4 when using only TMSIs for identification of the mobile stations.

The mobile station in idle mode is required to receive and analyse the paging messages and immediate assignment messages sent on the paging subchannel corresponding to its paging subgroup, as specified in 3GPP TS 45.002.

  NOTE 3:	The possible immediate assignment messages are: the IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT, the IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT EXTENDED and the IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT REJECT messages.

The paging and immediate assignment type messages contain a page mode information element. This information element controls possible additional requirements on mobile stations belonging to the paging subgroup corresponding to the paging subchannel the message was sent on. This implies that a given mobile station shall take into account the page mode information element of any message sent on its own paging subchannel whatever the nature of this message (paging messages or immediate assignment messages). This further implies that the mobile station does not take into account page mode information element of messages sent on paging subchannels other than its own paging subchannel. The requirements yielded by the page mode information element are as follows:

  a)	normal paging: no additional requirements;

  b)	extended paging: the mobile station is required in addition to receive and analyse the next but one message on the PCH;

  c)	paging reorganization: The mobile station shall receive all messages on the CCCH regardless of the BS-AG-BLKS-RES setting. It is required to receive all BCCH messages. When the mobile station receives the next message to its (possibly new) paging subgroup the subsequent action is defined in the page mode information element in that message;

  d)	same as before: No change of page mode from the previous page mode.

Note that a mobile station takes into account the page mode information only in messages of its own paging subchannel whatever the currently applied requirements (a, b, c or d).

When the mobile station selects a new PCH, the initial page mode in the mobile station shall be set to paging reorganization. If a message in the paging subchannel is not received correctly, the message is ignored and the previous page mode is assumed.


3.3.2.1.2	Paging initiation using paging subchannel on PCCCH

Paging initiation using a paging subchannel on PCCCH, see 3GPP TS 44.060, applies when sending paging information to a mobile station in packet idle mode and PCCCH is provided in the cell.

The paging initiation procedure and the paging request message used on PCCCH are specified in 3GPP TS 44.060.


3.3.2.1.3	Paging initiation using PACCH

Paging initiation using PACCH, see 3GPP TS 44.060, applies to a mobile station in packet transfer mode or in broadcast/multicast receive mode if so ordered by the network.

The paging initiation procedure and the message used to carry paging related information on PACCH are specified in 3GPP TS 44.060.


3.3.2.2	Paging response

Upon receipt of a paging request message, or other message containing information to trigger the establishment of a RR connection, and if access to the network is allowed, the addressed mobile station shall, when camped on a cell as specified in 3GPP TS 23.022, initiate the immediate assignment procedure as specified in sub-clause 3.3.1. The establishment of the main signalling link is then initiated by use of an SABM with information field containing the PAGING RESPONSE message (see sub-clause 3.1.5). The MM sublayer in the mobile station is informed that the RR entity has entered the dedicated mode.

If the PAGING RESPONSE message is being sent as part of a CS FallBack procedure, then the mobile station shall set the CSMT flag in the Additional Update Parameters IE.

Upon receipt of the PAGING RESPONSE message the network stops timer T3113. The MM sublayer in the network is informed that an RR connection exists.


3.3.2.3	Abnormal cases

Lower layer failure occurring during the immediate assignment procedure is treated as specified for that procedure.

If timer T3113 expires and a PAGING RESPONSE message has not been received, the network may repeat the paging request message and start timer T3113 again. The number of successive paging attempts is a network dependent choice.

3.3.3	Notification procedure

The support of notification procedure is mandatory for mobile stations supporting "VGCS receive" and/or "VBS receive".

The network informs the mobile station of starting or on-going voice broadcast calls and voice group calls with the notification procedure.

In cases where the mobile station has initiated a VGCS call, if the channel mode modify procedure is applied to turn the dedicated channel into a VGCS channel and ciphering may be applied for that call, in this case the network should suspend transmission of notification messages until ciphering with the group cipher key has started on the group channel.


3.3.3.1	Notification of a call

The mobile station may receive a notification that a voice broadcast call or a voice group call is established. Notifications may be sent on the NCH, on the PCH, or on the FACCH when in dedicated mode or group receive mode. The presence of an NCH is indicated on the PCH in the Pi Rest Octets IE. A notification contains the group call reference and possibly other related information. This notification may be contained:

  -	in a NOTIFICATION/NCH message sent on the NCH to notify mobile stations of VBS or VGCS calls in the current cell, possibly together with a description of the related VBS or VGCS channel, and if the call is ciphered the value of the related VSTK_RAND and CELL_GLOBAL_COUNT. If talker priority is supported by the network then the notification shall contain the status of the emergency mode if the emergency mode is set and the priority uplink access method. When the notification is segmented over two Notification/NCH messages, the status of the emergency mode shall only be present in the block that contains the group channel description; If the group call is using AMR in the cell then this shall be indicated in the description of the VGCS/VBS channel together with an indication of whether the channel is FR or HR. The notification may indicate whether or not SMS data confidentiality and SMS guaranteed privacy are required.

  -	in a NOTIFICATION/FACCH message sent in unacknowledged mode on the main DCCH to notify mobile stations in dedicated mode or on the main DCCH of a VGCS or VBS channel, of another VBS or VGCS call in the current cell, possibly together with a description of the related VBS or VGCS channel, and if the call is ciphered the value of the related VSTK_RAND, CELL_GLOBAL_COUNT and bit 22 of COUNT (related to TDMA frame number as defined in 3GPP TS 43.020). If talker priority is supported by the network then the notification shall contain the status of the emergency mode and the priority uplink access method; The notification shall also contain the AMR codec configuration if the notifications contains a channel description that indicates that AMR is being used. The notification may indicate whether or not SMS data confidentiality and SMS guaranteed privacy are required.

  -	in the rest octets part of a PAGING REQUEST TYPE 1 message. The notification may contain a description of the related VBS or VGCS channel and if the call is ciphered the value of the related VSTK_RAND and the CELL_GLOBAL_COUNT. The notification shall also contain the AMR codec configuration if the notifications contains a channel description that indicates that AMR is being used.

If the contents of the notification cannot be contained within one message, then the notification can be segmented as described in 3.3.3.2.2.

When the network supports ciphered group calls the CELL_GLOBAL_COUNT shall be provided on the NCH. When the MS camps on a cell it should read the NCH and determine if CELL_GLOBAL_COUNT is provided.

When the MS obtains its CELL_GLOBAL_COUNT via a message on the main DCCH that contains the VGCS Ciphering Parameters information element, it must check if the CELL_GLOBAL_COUNT provided in the message is up to date by comparing bit 22 of COUNT in the message with the actual value of COUNT. If the value of bit 22 of COUNT in the message is ‘1’ but the actual value is ‘0’, then the value of CELL_GLOBAL_COUNT obtained from any of the above messages on the main DCCH shall be incremented by one (modulo 4).

The CELL_GLOBAL_COUNT is optionally transmitted in the Paging Request Type 1 message on the PCH and in the Notification/FACCH message when these messages contain a notification for a ciphered group call. If the group call is ciphered but the CELL_GLOBAL_COUNT is not provided in notification on the PCH, then the mobile station may obtain the CELL_GLOBAL_COUNT from the NCH, if not already obtained.

The notifications for ciphered group calls that contain a group channel description shall also contain the VSTK_RAND.

Once the MS has obtained the CELL_GLOBAL_COUNT for the serving cell it shall maintain its own copy of the parameter, incrementing the CELL_GLOBAL_COUNT by one (modulo 4) each time bit 22 of COUNT changes from ‘1’ to ‘0’.

Only one AMR codec configuration is allowed per cell for all VGCS/VBS calls using FR AMR and one for all VGCS/VBS calls using HR AMR.

A mobile station supporting neither VGCS listening nor VBS listening may ignore the notifications sent on the NCH or PCH. It may also ignore the notifications sent on the main DCCH except that a RR-STATUS message shall be sent to the network with cause #97, "message not existent or not implemented".

Upon receipt of every notification message a mobile station supporting VGCS listening or VBS listening shall give an indication containing the notified group call reference(s) to upper layers in the mobile station.


3.3.3.2	Joining a VGCS or VBS call


3.3.3.2.1	General

In order to join a VGCS or a VBS call the following procedures apply.

In this sub-clause, the term notification refers to the notification which has triggered the decision to join a VGCS or VBS call. The notification for one VGCS/VBS call may by segmented across two messages, as described in sub-clause 3.3.3.2.2.

If the notification on the main DCCH concerns a VBS or VGCS in the current cell and does not contain a description of the VGCS or VBS channel, the mobile station shall read the corresponding notification on the NCH. If the notification is for a VGCS/VBS call that is ciphered and contains a description of the VGCS or VBS channel but the ciphering mechanism parameters (VSTK_RAND or CELL_GLOBAL_COUNT) or the corresponding group key on the USIM are not available, then the notification shall be discarded.

If the description of the VGCS or VBS channel was included in the notification for the current cell, RR connection establishment shall not be initiated, instead, the mobile station shall enter the group receive mode, unless the group call is ciphered and the ciphering mechanism parameters (ie VSTK_RAND or CELL_GLOBAL_COUNT) or the corresponding group key on the USIM are not available. In this case the notification shall be discarded.

If no description for the VGCS or VBS channel is included in the notification, the mobile station shall establish a RR connection in dedicated mode in order to initiate the notification response procedure.

When the group call is ciphered then the MS shall calculate the ciphering keys for use on the group channel using the group key with the following parameters, as described in 3GPP TS 43.020:

  -	VSTK_RAND (provided in the notification);

  -	CELL_GLOBAL_COUNT (provided in the notification);

  -	Cell Global Identifier (CGI) (provided in system information type 3 and 4);

  -	Group Cipher Key Number (provided in the group call reference that is contained within the notification).

The group cipher keys need to be recalculated whenever CELL_GLOBAL_COUNT changes. The MS obtains the identity of its ciphering algorithm from its USIM, as described in 3GPP TS 43.020.

When the VGCS mobile station is allocated a dedicated channel that is ciphered, the channel shall be ciphered with the individual ciphering keys of this mobile station.

In the case that AMR is used on the VGCS/VBS group channel, the mobile station shall obtain the AMR codec configuration for the channel. This configuration may be obtained the notification/NCH, notification/FACCH, Notification/PCH, the Channel Release message or from the system information type 6 message. The network shall provide the configuration in the system information type 6 message if AMR is being used on the VGCS/VBS channel. Additionally, the mobile station shall set the codec configuration parameters Noise Suppression Control Bit (NSCB) and the Initial Codec Mode Indicator (ICMI) to 0 (see subclause 10.5.2.21aa, MultiRate configuration).


3.3.3.2.2	Segmentation of notifications


3.3.3.2.2.1	General

Segmented notifications are only applicable to ciphered group calls. The second segment is used to contain additional parameters related to the VGCS ciphering mechanism (VSTK_RAND, CELL_GLOBAL_COUNT).

Notifications can be segmented on the NCH, FACCH and PCH as described in the following sub-clauses. All segments of a segmented notification shall be transmitted and reassembled on the same logical channel (ie NCH, FACCH or PCH).


3.3.3.2.2.2	Segmentation of notifications on NCH

The first segment of a segmented notification on the NCH contains the following fields;

  -	Group call Reference with group channel description;

  -	Indication that the group call is a ciphered group call, as indicated by Group Cipher Key within the group call reference;

  -	Optionally CELL_GLOBAL_COUNT;

  -	Segment Id is set to 0;

  -	Status of the Emergency mode if talker priority is supported by the network and emergency mode is set;

  -	Priority uplink access method, if talker priority or sending of application data is supported by the network;

  -	Indication of whether AMR is being used (either FR or HR);

  -	Indication of whether or not SMS data confidentiality is required;

  -	Indication of whether or not SMS guaranteed privacy is required.

The second segment of a segmented notification on the NCH contains the following fields:

  -	Same Group call reference as first segment or a Reduced Group Call reference that contains the same group or broadcast call reference and service flag as contained in the Group Call Reference in the first segment.

  -	No group channel description;

  -	VSTK_RAND and optionally CELL_GLOBAL_COUNT;

  -	Segment Id is set to 1.

When the MS receives a segment of a segmented notification for a group call that it is a member of and for which no previous segment has been received, it shall store the received segment and start timer T3206 for the given group call. The MS shall stop timer T3206 in any of the following cases

  -	The MS joins another group call;

  -	The MS reselects to another cell;

  -	The value of NLN changes;

  -	The MS receives the missing segment.

If timer T3206 expires, or if the MS has to stop T3206 for any other reason than receiving the missing segment, the MS shall discard the associated stored segment. 3.3.3.2.2.3	Segmentation of notifications on FACCH

The first segment of a segmented notification on the FACCH contains the following fields;

  -	Group call reference with group channel description;

  -	Indication that the group call is a ciphered group call, as indicated by Group Cipher Key Number within the group call reference;

  -	Optionally CELL_GLOBAL_COUNT;

  -	Status of the Emergency mode if talker priority supported by the network ;

  -	Priority uplink access method for talker priority-related uplink access requests, if talker priority is supported by the network;

  -	AMR codec configuration, if the group channel description indicates that AMR is being used (either FR or HR);

  -	Indication of whether or not SMS data confidentiality is required;

  -	Indication of whether or not SMS guaranteed privacy is required.

The second segment of a segmented notification on the FACCH contains the following fields:

  -	Same group call reference as first segment, with no group channel description;

  -	VSTK_RAND and optionally CELL_GLOBAL_COUNT.

When the MS receives the first segment of a segmented notification for a group call that it is a member of, it shall store the received segment and start timer T3208 for the given group call. The MS shall stop timer T3208 in any of the following cases

  -	The MS joins another call;

  -	The MS performs handover to another cell;

  -	The MS receives the associated second segment;

  -	The MS receives a VGCS Reconfigure message.

If timer T3208 expires, or if the MS has to stop T3208 for any other reason than receiving the second segment, the MS shall discard the associated stored segment. If the MS wants to join this group call at expiry of T3208,it shall read the NCH to obtain the full description of the group call.

When the MS receives the second segment of a notification of a group call that it is member of before receiving the associated first segment then the MS shall discard the second segment. If the MS wants to join this group call it shall read the NCH to obtain the full description of the group call.


3.3.3.2.2.3	Segmentation of notifications on PCH

The first segment of a segmented notification on the PCH contains the following fields;

  -	Group call reference and group channel description;

  -	Indication that the group call is a ciphered group call, as indicated by Group Cipher Key within the group call reference;

  -	Optionally CELL_GLOBAL_COUNT;

  -	AMR codec configuration, if the group channel description indicates that AMR is being used (either FR or HR).

The MS determines that the message contains the first segment of a segmented notification if the message contains both an indication that the group call is ciphered and the group channel description, but does not contain the VSTK_RAND.

The second segment of a segmented notification on the PCH contains the following fields:

  -	Same group call reference as first segment, or reduced group call reference;

  -	VSTK_RAND and optionally CELL_GLOBAL_COUNT.

The MS determines that the message contains the second segment of a segmented notification if the message contains both an indication that the group call is ciphered and the VSTK_RAND, but does not contain the group channel description.

The MS shall only combine the first segment of the notification with the second segment if they have the same group call reference.

When the MS receives the first segment of a notification of a group call that it is member of but the second segment is not correctly received at the next but one PCH block after receiving the first segment, and the MS wants to join this group call, then the MS may either read further PCH blocks in an attempt to find the missing segment or read the NCH to obtain the full description of the group call. When the MS reads further blocks on the PCH to find the missing segment, the MS shall start timer T3210. If timer T3210 expires, the associated segment shall be discarded and the MS shall stop reading the PCH for the missing segment.

When the MS receives the second segment of a notification of a group call that it is member of before receiving the associated first segment, and the MS wants to join this group call, then the MS may either read further PCH blocks in an attempt to find the missing segment or read the NCH to obtain the full description of the group call. When the MS reads further blocks on the PCH to find the missing segment, the MS shall start timer T3210. If timer T3210 expires, the associated segment shall be discarded and the MS shall stop reading the PCH for the missing segment.

The MS shall stop timer T3210 if:

  -	The missing segment is correctly received;

  -	The MS leaves Idle mode (the MS discards the associated segment);

  -	The MS determines that notifications for another group call are being sent on the PCH (the MS discards the associated segment).


3.3.3.3	Reduced NCH monitoring mechanism

This sub-clause applies to mobile stations which read the NCH in idle mode in order to receive the notification messages for the voice broadcast call and the voice group call, which read the PCH or PPCH to receive pagings and which aim at reducing the reception load.

A reduced NCH monitoring mechanism shall be used on the NCH. When the mobile station in idle mode enters a cell and deduces from the BCCH that an NCH is present, it shall read the NCH until it has received at least two messages on the NCH indicating NLN, with the two last received NLN being identical. Then it may stop reading the NCH until it receives on the PCH an NLN(PCH) different from the last previously received NLN or on the SACCH an NLN(SACCH) different from the last previously received NLN or on the PPCH an NLN(PPCH) different from the last previously received NLN.

For this, parameters are provided:

  NLN:	Notification List Number. The NLN is a modulo 4 counter. A change of NLN indicates that new notifications are provided on the NCH. The network shall ensure that a mobile station receives the NLN as often as necessary for a good functioning of the reduced monitoring.

  NLN status:	The NLN status is a single bit field which indicates the status of the content of the NOTIFICATION/NCH messages for a particular NLN value. A change of the NLN status field indicates a change of information on the NCH which is not related to new calls (e.g. There may have been a release of a previous notified call, a change in status of the emergency mode etc...).

The network has to provide both NLN and NLN status parameters.

These parameters are defined on the NCH, PCH, SACCH and PPCH:

  NLN(NCH):	Notification List Number (contained in certain NOTIFICATION messages on the NCH as required by the reduced NCH monitoring function).

  NLN(PCH):	Notification List Number (contained in all PAGING REQUEST TYPE 2 messages, PAGING REQUEST TYPE 3 messages and those PAGING REQUEST TYPE 1 messages with P1 rest octets value part of length >=1 on the PCH).

  NLN(SACCH):	Notification List Number (contained in all SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 6 messages on the SACCH when there are NCH blocks allocated ).

  NLN(PPCH):	Notification List Number (contained in all PACKET PAGING REQUEST messages containing at least one page request for an RR connection establishment and optionally contained in other PACKET PAGING REQUEST messages).

  NLN status(PCH):	NLN status (contained in all PAGING REQUEST TYPE 2 messages, PAGING REQUEST TYPE 3 messages and those PAGING REQUEST TYPE 1 messages with P1 rest octets value part of length >=1 on the PCH).

  NLN status(SACCH):	NLN status (contained in all SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 6 messages on the SACCH when there are NCH blocks allocated).

  NLN status(PPCH):	NLN status (contained in all PACKET PAGING REQUEST messages containing at least one page request for an RR connection establishment and optionally contained in other PACKET PAGING REQUEST messages).

When there are no VGCS or VBS calls active in the cell, the network shall transmit notification messages with an empty notification list (not necessarily in every NCH block) but with NLN(NCH).

A mobile station supporting neither VGCS listening nor VBS listening shall ignore the NLN(NCH),NLN(PCH), NLN(SACCH), NLN(PPCH) and NLN status fields.

If a mobile station (supporting VGCS listening and/or VBS listening) receives a NLN parameters on the NLN(PCH) or NLN(SACCH) or NLN(PPCH) field different from the last received NLN value it shall read the NCH until it has received at least two messages on the NCH indicating NLN with the two last received NLN being identical.

If a message in the paging subchannel on CCCH is not received correctly, or if a paging message on CCCH does not contain the information on the notification status, the mobile station shall read the NCH until it has received at least two messages on the NCH indicating NLN, with the two last received NLN being identical.

If a message in the paging subchannel on PCCCH is not received correctly and the mobile station has previously received notification status on PCCCH in that cell, the mobile station shall read the NCH until it has received at least two messages on the NCH indicating NLN, with the two last received NLN being identical.

If a packet paging message on PCCCH contains at least one page request for an RR connection establishment and does not contain the information on the notification status, the mobile station shall assume that information on the notification status on PCCCH is not provided in this cell. In this case the mobile shall perform reduced NCH mechanism by reading NLN(PCH) and NLN status(PCH) on PCH until the MS received information on the notification status on PCCCH.


3.3.3.4	Notification response procedure

In order to initiate the notification response procedure, if access to the network is allowed, the mobile station shall, when camped on a cell as specified in 3GPP TS 43.022, initiate the immediate assignment procedure as specified in 3.3.1. The establishment of the main signalling link is then initiated by use of an SABM with information field containing the NOTIFICATION RESPONSE message (see sub-clause 3.1.5). The Group or Broadcast Call Reference and the Service Flag in the Descriptive Group or Broadcast Call Reference Information Element shall be identical as received in the corresponding IE in the notification or paging messages. The MM sublayer in the mobile station is informed that the RR entity has entered the dedicated mode.

Upon receipt of the NOTIFICATION RESPONSE message the network stops timer T3101. The MM sublayer in the network may be informed that an RR connection exists; in this case, the MM sublayer may initiate MM common procedures.

The network may use the dedicated connection to order the mobile station to enter the group receive mode.


3.4	Procedures in dedicated mode and in group transmit mode

Procedures described in this sub-clause apply to the dedicated mode and/or the group transmit mode.

Those procedures which are specific for group transmit mode or refer to transitions to the group transmit mode are only applicable for mobile stations supporting VGCS talking.

Direct transition between dedicated mode and group transmit mode is possible in both directions by use of the following procedures:

  -	Channel assignment procedure;

  -	Handover procedure;

  -	Channel mode modify procedure.


3.4.1	SACCH procedures


3.4.1.1	General

In dedicated mode and group transmit mode, the SACCH is used in signalling layer at least for measurement results transmission from the mobile station.

The SACCH has the particularity that continuous transmission must occur in both directions at least on the channel carrying the main signalling link. For that purpose, in the mobile station to network direction, measurement result messages are sent at each possible occasion when nothing else has to be sent (see sub-clause 3.4.1.2). Similarly, SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 5, 6 and optionally 5bis and 5ter messages are sent in the network to mobile station direction in UI frames when nothing else has to be sent.

The network may in addition send MEASUREMENT INFORMATION messages on the SACCH, which may order the MS to use the enhanced measurement report.

In a multislot configuration the SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 5, 6 and optionally 5bis, 5ter and MEASUREMENT INFORMATION messages shall be sent on the SACCH associated with the channel carrying the main signalling link.

In a multislot configuration the mobile station shall ignore all messages received on the SACCH(s) that are not associated with the channel carrying the main signalling link.

On a VGCS channel, the network may send additional or alternative system information messages for both mobile stations in group transmit mode and those in group receive mode (see sub-clause 3.4.15.2.1).

A mobile station with extended measurement capabilities which receives EXTENDED MEASUREMENT ORDER (EMO) messages on the SACCH, shall perform and report extended measurements, see sub-clause 3.4.1.3.

The SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 5bis message shall be sent if and only if the EXT IND bit in the Neighbour Cell Description information element in both the SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 5 and TYPE 5bis messages indicates that each information element only carries part of the BA.

A GSM 900 mobile station which only supports the primary GSM band P-GSM 900 (cf. 3GPP TS 45.005) may consider the EXT-IND bit in the Neighbour cell description IE in the SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 5 message bit as a spare bit, assume that the information element carries the complete BA, and ignore any SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 5bis messages.

  NOTE:	The network should take into account limitations of certain mobile stations to understand SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 5ter and TYPE 5bis messages, the EXT-IND bit in the Neighbour cell description, and formats used in the Neighbour cell description information element and Cell Channel Description information element used in SYSTEM INFORMATION messages, see sub-clause 10.5.2.1b, and sub-clause 10.5.2.22.

Problems occurring in the reception of SACCH frames are interpreted as a loss of communication means and appropriate procedures are then triggered as specified in 3GPP TS 45.008.


3.4.1.2	Measurement Report and Enhanced Measurement Report

When in dedicated mode or group transmit mode, the mobile station regularly sends either MEASUREMENT REPORT or ENHANCED MEASUREMENT REPORT messages to the network. These messages contain measurement results about reception characteristics from the current cell and from neighbour cells. The BA (list) which is the initial basis for the measurements is derived from information received on the BCCH in System Information 2 and optionally 2bis and/or 2ter messages and on the SACCH in System Information 5 and optionally 5bis and/or 5ter messages. MEASUREMENT INFORMATION and SI2quater messages may add information for the GSM Neighbour Cell List and provide 3G Neighbour Cell list and/or E-UTRAN Neighbour Cell list. If System Information 23 message is broadcast in the cell, a mobile station supporting network sharing shall build the 3G Neighbour Cell list and/or E-UTRAN Neighbour Cell list as described in sub-clause 3.4.1.2.1.

The Mobile Station shall use ENHANCED MEASUREMENT REPORT messages instead of MEASUREMENT REPORT messages if that is indicated by the parameter REPORT_TYPE and if at least one BSIC is allocated to each BA (list) frequency. For report with the MEASUREMENT REPORT message, reporting is performed on three separate lists: the BA (list), the 3G Neighbour Cell List (for a multi-RAT MS supporting UTRAN) and the E-UTRAN Neighbour Cell list (for a multi-RAT MS supporting "E-UTRA Measurement and Reporting"). For report with the ENHANCED MEASUREMENT REPORT message, reporting is performed on the Neighbour Cell List (defined in sub-clause 3.4.1.2.1.3) and the E-UTRAN Neighbour Cell list (for a multi-RAT MS supporting "E-UTRA Measurement and Reporting").

The mobile station shall indicate its support for "E-UTRA Measurement and Reporting" in the Mobile Station Classmark 3 IE (see 3GPP TS 24.008).

In addition, the MS with ECSD options implemented shall use fast inband procedure for downlink quality reporting if the use of such procedure has been ordered by the BSC.

When the information is received in more than one message the mobile station shall only combine information relating to the BA (list) from messages received on the same channel and indicating the same value of the BCCH allocation sequence number (BA_IND) without any message indicating a different value of BA_IND received in between. After intracell change of channel (i.e. via ASSIGNMENT COMMAND, DTM ASSIGNMENT COMMAND, or HANDOVER COMMAND message) where the frequency band is not changed (GSM and E-GSM are considered to belong to the same frequency band), the MS may use the BA (list) received on SACCH in system information 5 and optionally 5bis and/or 5ter messages in the previous channel configuration during the time it has not yet received a new list in the new channel. In case the BCCH allocation sequence number (BA_IND) received in the new channel indicates the same value as the one already being used by the mobile station, the mobile station is not required to re-build the BA(list) in the new channel. If neighbour cell information for the serving cell is not available, the mobile station shall indicate this in the MEASUREMENT REPORT message. These measurement results are obtained as specified in 3GPP TS 45.008.

These messages are sent on the slow ACCH, in unacknowledged mode.

If no other message is scheduled on the SACCH at the instant when a layer 2 frame is due to be sent, then the mobile station shall send a MEASUREMENT REPORT message, an ENHANCED MEASUREMENT REPORT or an extended measurement report message (see sub-clause 3.4.1.3) in that frame. The interval between two successive layer 2 frames containing messages for measurement reporting shall not exceed one layer 2 frame.


3.4.1.2.1	Parameters for Measurements and Reporting

Parameters from the Measurement Information, SI2quater or PSI3quater messages allow an MS to build lists which are used for Measurement reporting, Enhanced Measurement reporting and for CCN mode settings. If the SI23 message is broadcast in the cell and the MS supports network sharing then:

  -	a multi-RAT MS supporting E-UTRANshall use parameters from the SI23 message instead of parameters from the SI2quater message to build the E-UTRAN Neighbour Cell list.

  -	a multi-RAT MS supporting UTRAN shall use parameters received in the MEASUREMENT INFORMATION message instead of parameters from the SI2quater message or SI23 message to build the 3G Neighbour Cell list.

A full set of MEASUREMENT INFORMATION messages is defined by a number of different instances indicated by the parameter MI_COUNT. Consistent sets of system information messages are defined in 3GPP TS 44.060. Two different instances of MEASUREMENT INFORMATION (respectively: SI2quater and SI23) messages are two MEASUREMENT INFORMATION (respectively: SI2quater and SI23) messages with different MI_INDEX (respectively: SI2quater_INDEX and SI23_INDEX) parameter values.

In the SI2quater message, the parameters with identical names in the GPRS specific structures (i.e. structures with the prefix GPRS) and in the non-GPRS specific structures (i.e. structures without the prefix GPRS) can have different values. For Measurement reporting and Enhanced Measurement reporting the MS shall ignore the parameters in the GPRS specific structures unless otherwise specified (e.g. sub-clause 3.4.1.2.1.2 and sub-clause 3.4.1.2.1.4). If the SI2quater message is not broadcast or all instances are not yet received or non-GPRS specific parameters in the SI2quater message are omitted, the MS in idle mode or dedicated mode or group transmit mode shall assume the default values defined in 3GPP TS 45.008.

The parameters for Measurements and Reporting received in a MEASUREMENT INFORMATION message shall override the old values.

Upon leaving dedicated mode or group transmit mode and entering idle mode, the MS shall delete the parameters received in all instances of the MEASUREMENT INFORMATION message and read the parameters from the SI2quater message and, for an MS supporting network sharing, the parameters from the SI23 message (if broadcast by the network), or use the parameters which were stored before entering the dedicated mode if they are still valid or assume the default values if the SI2quater message is not broadcast or non-GPRS specific parameters are omitted.

When fast acquisition of system information is not being used in the cell, the following procedures shall apply. The conditions for applying the fast acquisition of system information procedure are described in sub-clause 3.4.1.2.1.11. In Idle mode a multi-RAT MS supporting UTRAN camping on BCCH shall read and decode a consistent set of SI2quater messages to form a 3G Neighbour Cell list (each instance can be used as received). When the 3G_BA_IND parameter is changed in idle mode, the MS shall re-read all instances of the consistent set of SI2quater messages and rebuild the 3G Neighbour Cell list. A multi-RAT MS supporting UTRAN camping on PBCCH shall construct the 3G Neighbour Cell list from PSI3quater messages, see 3GPP TS 44.060. This list (either from SI2quater or from PSI3quater) shall then be used for reporting when the MS enters dedicated mode, until the MS has received a given number of instances of MEASUREMENT INFORMATION messages that contain 3G Neighbour Cell Description. This number of instances is defined by the 3G-WAIT parameter. When the 3G_BA_IND parameter is changed when on SACCH, the MS shall also re-read all instances, rebuild the 3G Neighbour Cell list, and use the new list for reporting based on the parameter 3G-Wait.

When the fast acquisition of system information procedure is being used in the cell, the procedure defined in sub-clause 3.4.1.2.1.11 shall be used.

For the GSM neighbour cell list the MS shall combine the BA (list) received in SI5/SI5bis/SI5ter with the BSIC list received in one or more instances, in ascending order of MI_INDEX, of the MEASUREMENT INFORMATION message with the same BA_IND value as the BA (list). When the BA_IND is changed the MS shall rebuild the combined list (the BSIC list shall also be rebuilt). The GSM neighbour cell list is also defined by the combination of the BA (list) received in SI2/SI2bis/SI2ter and the BSIC list received in one or more instances, in ascending order of SI2quater_INDEX, of the SI2quater message. When the BA_IND is changed the MS shall rebuild the combined list (the BSIC list shall also be rebuilt).

The MS shall combine the BA (list) received in SI5/SI5bis/SI5ter (respectively SI2/SI2bis/SI2ter) messages with the Real Time Differences parameters received in the MEASUREMENT INFORMATION (respectively SI2quater) message with the same BA_IND value as the BA (list). When the BA_IND is changed the MS shall re-read the Real Time Differences parameters in all instances.

The MS shall combine the Neighbour Cell list derived from SI5/SI5bis/SI5ter/MEASUREMENT INFORMATION messages (respectively SI2/SI2bis/SI2ter/SI2quater) with the REP_PRIORITY parameters received in the MEASUREMENT INFORMATION (respectively SI2quater) message with the same BA_IND and 3G_BA_IND values respectively as the Neighbour Cell list. When the BA_IND or 3G_BA_IND are changed the MS shall re-read the REP_PRIORITY parameters in all instances.

The MS shall combine the GSM Neighbour Cell list with the CCN_SUPPORTED parameters received in the SI2quater messages with the same BA_IND value as the GSM Neighbour Cell list. When the BA_IND is changed the MS shall re-read the CCN_SUPPORTED parameters in all instances.

If the MP_CHANGE_MARK parameter is changed, the MS shall re-read the Real Time differences, REP_PRIORITY, CCN_SUPPORTED, Measurement Parameters, 3G Measurement Parameters, Serving Cell Priority Parameters Description (SI2quater message only), 3G Priority Parameters Description (SI2quater message only) and 3G Measurement Control Parameters (MEASUREMENT INFORMATION message only) in all instances. The MS shall start using the parameters as soon as they have been received. In the case that not all the parameters have been received in a full set of instances, then the default values shall be used.

If the 3G_BA_IND parameter is changed a multi-RAT MS supporting E-UTRAN shall re-read the E-UTRAN Parameters Description. If SI23 message is broadcast in the cell a multi-RAT MS supporting network sharing shall re-read the Priority and E-UTRAN Parameters Description of the selected PLMN only when the SI 23_3G_BA_IND parameter in the SI23 message is changed. The MS shall start using the parameters as soon as they have been received. In the case that not all the parameters have been received in a full set of instances, then the default values shall be used.

When attempting to decode a consistent set of SI2quater (respectively, a full set of MEASUREMENT INFORMATION) messages, if none of the BA_IND, 3G_BA_IND (for a Multi-RAT MS supporting UTRAN and/or E-UTRAN), and MP_CHANGE_MARK values obtained from the first received SI2quater (respectively MEASUREMENT INFORMATION) message instance has changed since the previous acquisition then the mobile station can consider the parameters from SI2quater (respectively MEASUREMENT INFORMATION) as unchanged and should not decode the other SI2quater (respectively MEASUREMENT INFORMATION) message instances of the set.

When attempting to decode a consistent set of SI23 messages, if none of the SI 23_3G_BA_IND and SI 23_CHANGE_MARK values obtained from the first received SI23 message instance has changed since the previous acquisition then a multi-RAT mobile station supporting network sharing can consider the parameters from SI23 as unchanged and should not decode the other SI23 message instances of the set.


3.4.1.2.1.1	Deriving the 3G Neighbour Cell list from the 3G Neighbour Cell Description sent on BCCH or on SACCH

This applies only to a multi-RAT MS supporting UTRAN. One or more instances of the MEASUREMENT INFORMATION message or SI2quater message may provide 3G Neighbour Cell Description information. This information is used to build the 3G Neighbour Cell list. The 3G Neighbour Cell list may contain up to 96 3G Neighbour Cells and/or UTRAN frequencies for RSSI reporting.

Each 3G Neighbour Cell Description received in the MEASUREMENT INFORMATION message or in the SI2quater message is added to the 3G Neighbour Cell list, starting with the index equal to the parameter Index_Start_3G. If this parameter is not present then the value 0 shall be used.

For each 3G Neighbour Cell Description, the cells / UTRAN frequencies received in SI2quater or MEASUREMENT INFORMATION message  are indexed in the following order:

  1)	UTRAN FDD cells / UTRAN FDD frequencies: FDD ARFCNs are indexed in the order of occurrence in the 3G Neighbour Cell description. For each FDD ARFCN indicating UTRAN FDD cells, the cells are indexed in the order of increasing values of the decoded FDD_CELL_INFORMATION parameters.
    2)	UTRAN TDD cells / UTRAN TDD frequencies: TDD ARFCNs are indexed in the order of occurrence in the 3G Neighbour Cell description. For each TDD ARFCN indicating UTRAN TDD cells, the cells are indexed in the order of increasing values of the decoded TDD_CELL_INFORMATION parameters.
    3)	CDMA 2000 cells: the cells are indexed in the order of occurrence in the 3G Neighbour Cell description.

If a 3G Neighbour Cell Description  includes non-supported frequencies or Radio Access Technologies, this shall not be considered as an error; indices in the 3G Neighbour Cell list shall be incremented accordingly.

If more than one cell / UTRAN frequency with the same index in the 3G Neighbour Cell list are provided by different instances of 3G Neighbour Cell Descriptions, the cell / UTRAN frequency from the message instance with the highest index shall be used. In case the same 3G Cell / UTRAN frequency occurs more than once in the resulting 3G Neighbour Cell list, each occurrence shall be assigned an index but only the cell / UTRAN frequency with the highest index in the 3G Neighbour Cell list shall be referred to in measurement reports.

For a mobile station indicating support for UTRA Multiple Frequency Band Indicators (MFBI) in the MS Classmark 3 IE (see 3GPP TS 24.008), the network may send different FDD ARFCN values corresponding to different frequency bands but designating the same physical UTRAN frequency in the MEASUREMENT INFORMATION message. The network may also broadcast different FDD ARFCN values corresponding to different frequency bands but designating the same physical UTRAN frequency in the SI2quater message; in such a case, a mobile station supporting UTRA Multiple Frequency Band Indicators (MFBI) shall consider a FDD ARFCN value belonging to frequency band it does not support as a non-supported frequency. When a MEASUREMENT INFORMATION message or a SI2quater message is received by the MFBI capable MS, each occurrence of a FDD ARFCN corresponding to different frequency bands but designating the same physical UTRAN frequency shall be assigned an index in the 3G Neighbour Cell list. However, only the highest index in the list that corresponds to a supported frequency band shall be referred to in measurement reports.

If a cell / UTRAN frequency is provided for an index higher than 95 in the 3G Neighbour Cell list, this shall not be considered as an error; the cell / UTRAN frequency shall not be included in the 3G Neighbour Cell list.

The MS behaviour is not specified if the number of 3G frequencies or cells exceeds the MS monitoring capabilities as defined in 3GPP TS 45.008.


3.4.1.2.1.1a	Deriving the E-UTRAN Neighbour Cell list from the Repeated E-UTRAN Neighbour Cell information sent on BCCH or on SACCH

This applies only to a multi-RAT MS supporting E-UTRAN. One or more instances of the MEASUREMENT INFORMATION message or SI2quater message may provide E-UTRAN Neighbour Cell Description information in one or more instances of the Repeated E-UTRAN Neighbour Cells (respectively for the MEASUREMENT INFORMATION message and if the mobile station and the network supports extended EARFCNs, the Repeated E-UTRAN NC with extended EARFCNs IE). This is used to build the E-UTRAN Neighbour Cell list. The fast acquisition of system information procedure, as defined in subclause 3.4.1.2.1.11, shall be used to acquire E-UTRAN measurement parameters and neighbour cell information from SI2quater and MEASUREMENT INFORMATION.

In the case network sharing is in use in the cell, the SI23 message may provide PLMN specific E-UTRAN frequencies in Priority and E-UTRAN Parameters Description IE; when broadcasted in the cell, a multi-RAT MS supporting network sharing shall use this information to build the E-UTRAN Neighbour Cell list for the selected PLMN. When the SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 23 message is not broadcasted in the cell, a mobile station supporting network sharing shall use the information provided within the SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 2quater message to build the E-UTRAN NCL (see above); the same requirement applies when the mobile station does not support network sharing.

In the case extended EARFCNs is in use in the cell, the SI2quater message may additionally provide E-UTRAN frequencies within the Extended EARFCNs Description IE. A multi-RAT MS supporting extended EARFCNs but not supporting network sharing shall use this information to build the E-UTRAN Neighbour Cell list; the same requirement applies for a multi-RAT MS supporting network sharing when the SI23 message is not broadcasted in the cell.

The E-UTRAN Neighbour Cell list may contain up to 8 E-UTRAN frequencies. For each E-UTRAN frequency, zero or more E-UTRAN neighbour cells may be specified that are not allowed for cell reselection. The list of not allowed cells is defined in the Not Allowed Cells IEs (alternatively, defined in PLMN-specific Repeated E-UTRAN Not Allowed Cells in the SI23 message).

If a Priority and E-UTRAN Parameters Description includes non-supported frequencies or Radio Access Technologies, this shall not be considered as an error; indices in the Priority and E-UTRAN Parameters Description shall be incremented accordingly.

Each EARFCN in each instance of the Repeated E-UTRAN Neighbour Cells IE (respectively and if the mobile station and the network supports extended EARFCNs, the Repeated E-UTRAN NC with extended EARFCNs IE) is added to the E-UTRAN Neighbour Cell list in the order in which they appear in the IE. Different instances of the Repeated E-UTRAN Neighbour Cells IE shall be evaluated in ascending order of the SI2quater_INDEX (respectively MI_INDEX) of the SI2quater (respectively MEASUREMENT INFORMATION) message that they are received in.

Alternatively, each EARFCN in each instance of the PLMN-specific Repeated E-UTRAN Neighbour Frequency and Priority IE in SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 23 message is added to the E-UTRAN Neighbour Cell list in the order in which they appear in the IE. Different instances of the PLMN-specific Repeated E-UTRAN Neighbour Frequency and Priority IE (respectively and if the mobile station and the network supports extended EARFCNs, the Repeated E-UTRAN NC with extended EARFCNs IE) shall be evaluated in ascending order of the SI23_INDEX (respectively MI_INDEX) of the SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 23 (respectively MEASUREMENT INFORMATION) message instances that they are received in.

In case the same E-UTRAN frequency occurs more than once in the resulting E-UTRAN Neighbour Cell list, each occurrence shall be assigned an index but only the E-UTRAN frequency with the highest index in the E-UTRAN Neighbour Cell list shall be referred to in measurement reports.

For a mobile station indicating support for E-UTRA Multiple Frequency Band Indicators (MFBI) in the MS Classmark 3 IE (see 3GPP TS 24.008), the network may send different EARFCN values corresponding to different frequency bands but designating the same physical E-UTRAN frequency in the MEASUREMENT INFORMATION message. The network may also broadcast different EARFCN values corresponding to different frequency bands but designating the same physical E-UTRAN frequency in the SI2quater message or SI23 message; in such a case, a mobile station supporting E-UTRA Multiple Frequency Band Indicators (MFBI) shall consider an EARFCN value belonging to frequency band it does not support as a non-supported frequency. When a MEASUREMENT INFORMATION message or a SI2quater message or a SI23 message is received by the MFBI capable MS, each occurrence of an EARFCN corresponding to different frequency bands but designating the same physical E-UTRAN frequency shall be assigned an index in the E-UTRAN Neighbour Cell list. However, only the highest index in the list that corresponds to a supported frequency band shall be referred to in measurement reports.

The mobile station behaviour is not specified if the number of E-UTRAN frequencies exceeds the MS monitoring capabilities as defined in 3GPP TS 45.008.

When SI23 message is broadcast in the cell and network sharing is supported by the multi-RAT MS, the MS shall read the SI23 message instances of the selected PLMN in order to build the E-UTRAN Neighbour Cell list. When the SI 23_BA_IND parameter is changed in idle mode, the MS shall re-read the SI23 message instances of the selected PLMN and rebuild the E-UTRAN Neighbour Cell list.
The E-UTRAN Neighbour Cell list derived from the SI23 message shall then be used for measurement reporting when the MS enters dedicated mode, until it has received all relevant instances of the MEASUREMENT INFORMATION message.


3.4.1.2.1.1b	Deriving the E-UTRAN Neighbour Cell list from the Repeated E-UTRAN Neighbour Cell information sent on BCCH or on SACCH (abnormal cases)

In the case Extended EARFCNs is in use in the cell, the network may broadcast EARFCNs > 65535 within the SI2quater message using the Extended EARFCNs Description IE (see table 10.5.2.33b.2). A mobile station supporting Extended EARFCNs and using the SI2quater message to build its E-UTRAN Neighbour Cell list shall manage each EARFCN value 65535 within the Repeated E-UTRAN Neighbour Cells IE as described within the table 10.5.2.33b.2. In the case no EARFCN corresponding to the nth EARFCN value 65535 can be found within the Extended EARFCNs Description IE the mobile station shall assume the value 65535 for the nth EARFCN.


3.4.1.2.1.2	Deriving the GSM Neighbour Cell list from the BSICs and the BA (list)

One or more instances of the Measurement Information message may provide BSIC information. This is used to build the GSM Neighbour Cell list. The GSM Neighbour Cell list may contain up to 96 Neighbour Cells.

The BSICs are associated to the frequencies in the BA (list) with the same BA_IND value. The BSICs may be received before the corresponding BA (list). The first BSIC in each instance applies to the frequency in the BA (list) referenced by the parameter BA_Index_Start_BSIC. For each successive BSIC, one bit indicates if the BSIC applies to the same frequency as the previous BSIC or to the next frequency in the BA (list), as defined in sub-clause 9.1.54, Measurement Information message.

In case the same cell (ARFCN+BSIC) occurs more than once in the resulting GSM Neighbour Cell list, each occurrence shall be assigned an GSM Neighbour Cell list index but only the cell with the highest GSM Neighbour Cell list index shall be used and referred to in measurement reports.

If GPRS BSIC Description is provided in the SI2quater message (see sub-clause 3.4.1.2.1.6), it shall be saved and used by a non-GPRS mobile station as initial BSIC information in connected mode.


3.4.1.2.1.3	Deriving the Neighbour Cell list from the GSM Neighbour Cell list and the 3G Neighbour Cell list

For report with the ENHANCED MEASUREMENT REPORT message, the Neighbour Cell list is the concatenation of the GSM Neighbour Cell list and the 3G Neighbour Cell list (if any). In this concatenation the value of the parameter Absolute_Index_Start_EMR is added to the 3G Neighbour Cell list indices. The Neighbour Cell list may contain up to 96 Neighbour Cells. If the same index occurs for a GSM Cell and a 3G Cell, the GSM Cell shall be used.

  NOTE:	For report with the MEASUREMENT REPORT message, the concatenated list is not used. Instead, the two lists are used separately, as defined in sub-clause 10.5.2.20, 'Measurement Results'.


3.4.1.2.1.4	Real Time Differences

One or more instances of the Measurement Information message may provide Real Time Difference information. This is used to build the Real Time Difference list. The mobile station may use Real Time Difference parameters before receiving the BSIC information defined in sub-clause 3.4.1.2. The Real Time Difference list may contain up to 96 Real Time Difference parameters.

The Real Time Difference list is associated with the BA (list) having the same BA_IND value. Each frequency in the BA (list) may be associated to 0, 1 or more Real Time Difference parameters. The Real Time Difference parameters may be received before the corresponding BA (list). The parameter BA_Index_Start_RTD in each structure indicates the index of the frequency in the BA (list) to be taken as a starting reference. A sub-structure is included for each frequency referenced. Each of those sub-structures indicates if 0, 1 or more RTD parameters are present for this frequency. If a frequency in the BA (list) is not provided with Real Time Difference information by any of the message instances with correct BA_IND, it shall be assumed that no information is available for that frequency, see sub-clause 9.1.54 'Measurement Information message'. If more than 96 Real Time Difference parameters are provided for the Real Time Difference list, this shall not be considered as an error.

If GPRS Real Time Differences Description is provided in the SI2quater message (see sub-clause 3.4.1.2.1.6), it may also be used by a non-GPRS mobile station in Idle mode.

The MS is not required to take into account more RTDs than cells on the frequency.


3.4.1.2.1.5	Report Priority Description

Report Priority information can be received in one instance of the MEASUREMENT INFORMATION message. The Report Priority information is associated with the Neighbour Cell list (see sub-clause 3.4.1.2.1.3) having the same BA_IND value and 3G_BA_IND value. Each REP_PRIORITY bit of this field relates to indices of the Neighbour Cell list, starting with index 0. The Report Priority information may be received before the corresponding Neighbour Cell list.

Indices exceeding the value 95 shall be ignored. If there are fewer indices than the number of Neighbour Cells, the value 0 shall be assumed for the missing bits.


3.4.1.2.1.6	GPRS Parameters

A set of information may be received in the SI2quater message to be used for GPRS neighbour cell measurement and (NC) Measurement reporting when the cell has no PBCCH allocated, see 3GPP TS 44.060. This information comprises GPRS Report Priority Description, GPRS BSIC Description, GPRS Real Time Differences Description, GPRS Measurement Parameters, GPRS 3G Measurement Parameters, NC Measurement Parameters and GPRS E-UTRAN Measurement Parameters. The use of the parameters is similar to parameters without the term "GPRS".


3.4.1.2.1.7	The 3G Cell Reselection list

This applies only to a multi-RAT MS. One or more instances of the SI2quater and/or SI2ter messages may provide 3G Cells. If 3G Cells are provided in both of these messages, the union of the cells shall be included in the 3G Cell Reselection list. If network sharing is used in the cell, a mobile station supporting network sharing shall instead use information provided in the SI23 message to build the 3G Cell reselection list. The 3G Cell Reselection list may contain up to 96 3G Cells. 3G Cells not provided explicitly in the SI2ter message or in the SI2quater message (frequencies on their own) are not included in these 96 cells. Up to 8 frequencies on their own, can be added to these 96 cells including when applicable, 3G frequencies broadcast in the SI23 message.

  NOTE:	Frequencies in the SI2quater message for which the parameter NR_OF_FDD_CELLS or NR_OF_TDD_CELLS is set to 31 are only added to the 3G Cell Reselection list (frequencies on their own). Frequencies for which NR_OF_FDD_CELLS is set to 0 (and FDD_Indic0 is set to 0) are added to the 3G Neighbour Cell list and are only used for RSSI reporting (subject to the restrictions given in 3GPP TS 45.008). Frequencies for which NR_OF_FDD_CELLS is set to a value from 17 to 30 or NR_OF_TDD_CELLS is set to a value of 0 with TDD_indic0 set to 0 or to a value from 21 to 30 are not added to the 3G Cell Reselection list, they are handled as described in sub-clause 10.5.2.33b.

The MS behaviour is not specified if the number of 3G frequencies or cells exceeds the MS monitoring capabilities as defined in 3GPP TS 45.008.


3.4.1.2.1.7a	(void)


3.4.1.2.1.7b	Closed Subscriber Group Information

This applies only to a multi-RAT MS supporting UTRAN and/or E-UTRAN. One or more instances of the SI2quater message or MEASUREMENT INFORMATION message may provide the E-UTRAN CSG Description IE and/or the 3G CSG Description IE. An MS supporting cell reselection to UTRAN and/or E-UTRAN shall use this information as described in 3GPP TS 45.008.

In the case extended EARFCNs is in use in the cell, the SI2quater message may provide E-UTRAN CSG frequencies within the Extended EARFCNs Description for CSG Cells IE. A multi-RAT MS supporting extended EARFCNs shall use this information as described in 3GPP TS 45.008.

If an MS receives a CSG_PSC_SPLIT IE and/or a CSG_PCI_SPLIT IE it shall store this information and shall consider it as being valid for the specified frequencies for a period of up to 24 hours or until a new CSG_PSC_SPLIT IE and/or a new CSG_PCI_SPLIT IE is received, whichever occurs first.

Any valid "CSG PSC Split Information" received from a UTRAN frequency and stored by the mobile station shall take precedence over the information received from the CSG_PSC_SPLIT IE for that frequency. Any valid "CSG PCI Split Information" received from an E-UTRAN frequency and stored by the mobile station shall take precedence over the information received from the CSG_PCI_SPLIT IE for that frequency.


3.4.1.2.1.7c	The 3G Frequency list

The 3G Frequency list consists of the set of UTRAN frequencies contained in the 3G Cell Reselection list (derived from the SI2quater and/or the SI2 ter messages) or in the 3G Neighbour Cell list (derived from the MEASUREMENT INFORMATION message) or, if network sharing is supported in the cell, in the set of UTRAN frequencies contained in the SI23 message. The 3G Frequency list includes all frequencies with cells contained in the 3G Neighbour Cell list and (where applicable) frequencies on their own provided by the SI2quater message and/or the SI2ter message or frequencies provided in the SI23 message.

When multiple cells on the same frequency or multiple references to the same frequency are included in the 3G Neighbour Cell list or 3G Cell Reselection list an index into the 3G Frequency list is allocated for that frequency only the first time it is encountered as outlined below.

Indices for the 3G Frequency list are allocated according to the following steps. When indices are allocated using the 3G Neighbour Cell list derived from the MEASUREMENT INFORMATION message, steps 2 and 3 shall be ignored.

  1)	Frequencies contained in the 3G Neighbour Cell list are allocated indices that start from 0 and are incremented for each frequency. An index value of 0 refers to the first UTRAN frequency (TDD-ARFCN or FDD-ARFCN) contained in the 3G Neighbour Cell list; an index value of 1 refers to the second frequency contained in the 3G Neighbour Cell list; and so on. Indices to the 3G Frequency list are allocated according to the order in which 3G cells appear in the 3G Neighbour Cell list. An entry in the 3G Neighbour Cell list indicating a frequency for RSSI reporting shall not result in the allocation of an index.

  2)	UTRAN frequencies on their own provided by the SI2quater message (i.e. frequencies for which the parameter NR_OF_FDD_CELLS or NR_OF_TDD_CELLS is set to 31) are allocated indices that start from 31 and continue in descending order. Indices are first allocated according to increasing order of the SI2quater_INDEX field within a consistent set of SI2quater messages then according to their order of occurrence within the 3G Neighbour Cell description IE for a given SI2quater_INDEX.

  3)	UTRAN frequencies on their own provided by the SI2ter message are allocated indices that start from (31 - N_UTRAN_OWN_SI2QUATER) and continue in descending order. Indices are first allocated according to increasing order of the SI2ter_INDEX field within a consistent set of SI2ter messages then according to their order of occurrence within the UTRAN FDD Description and/or UTRAN TDD Description IEs for a given SI2ter_INDEX. N_UTRAN_OWN_SI2QUATER is defined as the number of the UTRAN frequencies on their own provided by the SI2quater message.


3.4.1.2.1.8	CCN Support description

The SI2quater message may also contain information, the CCN Support description, to be used when CCN is enabled in the serving cell, see 3GPP TS 44.060. This CCN Support description is associated with the GSM Neighbour Cell list (see 3.4.1.2.1.2) having the same BA_IND value. Each CCN_SUPPORTED bit of this field relates to indices of the GSM Neighbour Cell list, starting with index 0. The CCN Support description may be received before the corresponding GSM Neighbour Cell list.

Indices exceeding the value 95 or the number of cells in the GSM Neighbour Cell List shall be ignored. If there are fewer indices than the number of cells in the GSM Neighbour Cell List, the value 0 shall be assumed for the missing bits.

When this information is not present but CCN is enabled in the serving cell, the mobile station shall assume that CCN is enabled towards all neighbour cells.


3.4.1.2.1.9	3G_CCN_ACTIVE Description

The SI2quater message may also contain the 3G_CCN_ACTIVE parameter in order to indicate whether the MS shall perform the CCN procedures in the serving cell when re-selecting to a 3G neighbour cell, see 3GPP TS 44.060.

The 3G_CCN_ACTIVE parameter indicates if CCN is activated in serving cell towards all 3G neighbour cells.


3.4.1.2.1.9a	E-UTRAN_CCN_ACTIVE Description

The SI2quater message may also contain the E-UTRAN_CCN_ACTIVE parameter in order to indicate whether the MS shall perform the CCN procedures in the serving cell when re-selecting to an E-UTRAN neighbour cell, see 3GPP TS 44.060.

The E-UTRAN_CCN_ACTIVE parameter indicates if CCN is activated in the serving cell towards all E-UTRAN neighbour cells.


3.4.1.2.1.10	GSM Neighbour Cell Selection parameters

The SI2n message contains cell reselection parameters for the GSM neighbouring cells. These GSM Neighbour Cell Selection parameters are associated with the GSM Neighbour Cell list (see 3.4.1.2.1.2) having the same BA_IND value. For the application of this information, see 3GPP TS 45.008.

The GSM Neighbour Cell Selection parameters may be received before the corresponding GSM Neighbour Cell list.


3.4.1.2.1.11	Fast Acquisition of System Information

For a multi-RAT MS, the fast acquisition of system information procedure shall be applied to UTRAN if the 3G Priority Parameters Description IE is present in the SI2quater message or 3G Supplementary Parameters Description IE is present in the MEASUREMENT INFORMATION message. The procedure shall apply to E-UTRAN if the E-UTRAN Parameters Description IE is present in the SI2quater or MEASUREMENT INFORMATION messages.

The network shall ensure that UTRAN (respectively E-UTRAN) neighbour cell list, UTRAN (respectively E-UTRAN) measurement parameters and UTRAN (respectively E-UTRAN) priority information are contained in consecutive instances of SI2quater message and that, immediately following this information, 3G CSG Description (respectively E-UTRAN CSG Description) parameters are contained in consecutive instances of  the message together forming a UTRAN information set (respectively E-UTRAN information set). Similarly, in the case of MEASUREMENT INFORMATION messages, the network shall ensure that UTRAN (respectively E-UTRAN) neighbour cell list and UTRAN (respectively E-UTRAN) measurement parameters are contained in consecutive instances of the message and that, immediately following this information, 3G CSG Description (respectively E-UTRAN CSG Description) parameters are contained in consecutive instances of the message together forming a UTRAN information set (respectively E-UTRAN information set).

The UTRAN_Start (respectively E-UTRAN_Start) bit and the UTRAN_Stop (respectively E-UTRAN_Stop) bit shall be set as specified below:

  -	The first instance of the SI2quater or MEASUREMENT INFORMATION message containing UTRAN (respectively E-UTRAN) neighbour cell list and/or UTRAN (respectively E-UTRAN) measurement parameters and/or UTRAN (respectively E-UTRAN) priority information shall have the UTRAN_Start (respectively E-UTRAN_Start) bit set to value ‘1’. The last instance of the SI2quater or MEASUREMENT INFORMATION message containing UTRAN (respectively E-UTRAN) neighbour cell list and/or UTRAN (respectively E-UTRAN) measurement parameters and/or UTRAN (respectively E-UTRAN) priority information shall have the UTRAN_Stop (respectively E-UTRAN_Stop) bit set to value ‘1’.; or

  -	Alternatively, if all instances of the SI2quater or MEASUREMENT INFORMATION message contain UTRAN (respectively E-UTRAN) neighbour cell list and/or UTRAN (respectively E-UTRAN) measurement parameters and/or UTRAN (respectively E-UTRAN) priority information, the network may instead set UTRAN_Start (respectively E-UTRAN_Start) bit and UTRAN_Stop (respectively E-UTRAN_Stop) bit to ‘0’ in every instance containing these bits.

Not including or not setting of UTRAN_Start (respectively E-UTRAN_Start) bit and/or UTRAN_Stop (respectively E-UTRAN_Stop) bit according to the above is considered as an abnormal case in which the mobile station’s behaviour is implementation specific.

The network shall ensure that the Serving cell priority parameters are included in at least one instance of the SI2quater message containing the UTRAN (respectively E-UTRAN) neighbour cell list, measurement parameters, or priority information. If the network repeats the Serving cell priority parameters within a consistent set of messages, then the network shall ensure that same set of Serving cell priority parameters are included in all repeated instances.

The network may repeat a UTRAN information set or an E-UTRAN information set within a consistent set of messages, provided that the information contained in all repeated information sets is the same. On BCCH, the MS needs only receive and decode the information in a single information set.

In idle mode or packet idle mode a multi-RAT MS supporting UTRAN and camping on BCCH shall read and decode all instances of SI2quater messages containing the UTRAN information set. When the 3G_BA_IND parameter is changed in idle mode or packet idle mode, the MS shall acquire the new UTRAN information set and rebuild the 3G Neighbour Cell list. The 3G Neighbour Cell list derived from SI2quater shall then be used for reporting when the MS enters dedicated mode, until it has received all instances of MEASUREMENT INFORMATION messages containing the UTRAN information set. In this case, the newly constructed 3G Neighbour Cell list shall be used. When the 3G_BA_IND parameter is changed when on SACCH, the MS shall also re-read all the instances of MEASUREMENT INFORMATION messages containing the new UTRAN information set, rebuild the 3G Neighbour Cell list, and use the new list for reporting.

In idle mode or packet idle mode a multi-RAT MS supporting E-UTRAN and camping on BCCH shall read and decode all instances of SI2quater messages containing the E-UTRAN information set. When the 3G_BA_IND parameter is changed in idle mode or packet idle mode, the MS shall acquire the new E-UTRAN information set and rebuild the E-UTRAN Neighbour Cell list.  The E-UTRAN Neighbour Cell list shall then be used for reporting when the MS enters dedicated mode, until it has received all instances of MEASUREMENT INFORMATION messages containing the E-UTRAN information set. In this case, the newly constructed E-UTRAN Neighbour Cell list shall be used. When the 3G_BA_IND parameter is changed when on SACCH, the MS shall also re-read all the instances of MEASUREMENT INFORMATION messages containing the new E-UTRAN information set, rebuild the E-UTRAN Neighbour Cell list, and use the new list for reporting.


3.4.1.2.1.12	Reporting of CSG Cells and Hybrid Cells

A multi-RAT mobile station in dedicated mode or dual transfer mode may report a UTRAN CSG cell or hybrid cell if:

  -	the mobile station has received the UTRAN CSG Cells Reporting Description IE from the network in the SI2quater or MEASUREMENT INFORMATION message; and

  -	the mobile station has determined that it is allowed to access the CSG cell or hybrid cell, i.e. the CSG ID and the PLMN ID of the CSG cell or hybrid cell matches both a CSG ID and an associated PLMN ID stored in the mobile station’s CSG Whitelist (see 3GPP TS 23.122) and the PLMN ID of the CSG cell or hybrid cell matches:

    -	RPLMN ID or a PLMN ID in the EPLMN list and

       -	in dedicated mode after handover, the PLMN ID received in the System Information Type 6 message;

       -	in dual transfer mode, the RPLMN ID or a PLMN ID in the EPLMN list received during the latest registration or registration update with CS domain.

Further conditions and measurement reporting restrictions are specified in 3GPP TS 45.008.

The mobile station shall not report UTRAN CSG cells if it receives a MEASUREMENT INFORMATION message that does not include the UTRAN CSG Cells Reporting Description IE.

A mobile station shall report a detected UTRAN CSG cell, or hybrid cell which meets all the conditions and measurement reporting restrictions applicable to CSG cells, by including the UTRAN_CSG_Measurement_Report IE in the Measurement Results IE when reporting with the MEASUREMENT REPORT message or by including the UTRAN CSG Measurement Report IE in the ENHANCED MEASUREMENT REPORT message.

A hybrid cell which does not meet all the conditions and measurement reporting restrictions applicable to CSG cells shall be reported according to the rules for reporting non-CSG cells.

  NOTE:	The autonomous search function used to detect a CSG cell and determine whether a detected cell is a hybrid cell or not is implementation dependent and no performance requirements apply for this function while the mobile station is in dedicated or dual transfer mode.


3.4.1.3	Extended measurement report $(MAFA)$

Only applicable to mobile stations which support extended measurement.

When in dedicated mode or group transmit mode, a mobile station may receive an EXTENDED MEASUREMENT ORDER message, from the network. As defined in 3GPP TS 45.008, the mobile station shall then perform measurements on the frequencies specified by this EXTENDED MEASUREMENT ORDER message for one reporting period. The mobile station shall thereafter send an EXTENDED MEASUREMENT REPORT message. This message contains the measurement results as defined in 3GPP TS 45.008.

If the mobile station has not started to send its EXTENDED MEASUREMENT REPORT message within 10 seconds after the reception of the EXTENDED MEASUREMENT ORDER message, no EXTENDED MEASUREMENT REPORT message shall be sent. The mobile station shall after a successful channel change abort any pending measurements or reporting related to an EXTENDED MEASUREMENT ORDER message received on the old channel.

If a mobile station receives an EXTENDED MEASUREMENT ORDER message indicating the same value of the sequence code as an EXTENDED MEASUREMENT ORDER message received earlier on the same channel without having received any EXTENDED MEASUREMENT ORDER message indicating a different value of the sequence code in between, that EXTENDED MEASUREMENT ORDER message shall be ignored. If the mobile station, before the reporting related to an EXTENDED MEASUREMENT ORDER message has started, receives a new EXTENDED MEASUREMENT ORDER message with a different value of the sequence code, any pending measurements or reporting related to the earlier EXTENDED MEASUREMENT ORDER message shall be aborted and the new message treated.

The EXTENDED MEASUREMENT ORDER message and the EXTENDED MEASUREMENT REPORT message are sent on the SACCH, in unacknowledged mode.


3.4.2	Transfer of messages and link layer service provision

When in dedicated mode or in group transmit mode, upper layers can send messages in multiframe or unacknowledged mode on SAPI 0. In group receive mode optionally messages in multiframe mode can be send on SAPI 3.

Moreover, but only when in dedicated mode, upper layers have access to the full link layer services for SAPIs other than 0, with the exception of the error indication and local end release that are directly treated by the RR sublayer, as specified in particular places of clause 3.


3.4.3	Channel assignment procedure

In dedicated mode, dual transfer mode or in group transmit mode, an intracell change of channel can be requested by upper layers for changing the channel type, or decided by the RR sublayer, e.g. for an internal handover. This change may be performed through the dedicated channel assignment procedure.

The purpose of the channel assignment procedure is to completely modify the physical channel configuration of the mobile station without frequency redefinition or change in synchronization while staying in the same cell.

This procedure shall not be used for changing between dependent configurations, i.e. those sharing Radio Resource for the main signalling link. An example of dependent channels is a full rate channel and one of the corresponding half rate channels. In multislot operation however, it is allowed to use the same timeslots before and after the assignment, as long as the main signalling link has been changed. The only procedures provided for changing between dependent configurations for the main signalling link are the additional assignment and the partial release procedures.

The channel assignment procedure happens only in dedicated mode, dual transfer mode and in group transmit mode. This procedure cannot be used in the idle mode; in this case the immediate assignment procedure is used.

The channel assignment procedure includes:

  -	the suspension of normal operation except for RR management (layer 3);

  -	the release of the main signalling link, and of the other data links as defined in sub-clause 3.1.4, the disconnection of TCHs if any, and the release of packet resources, if in dual transfer mode;

  -	the deactivation of previously assigned channels (layer 1);

  -	the activation of the new channels and their connection if applicable;

  -	the triggering of the establishment of the data link connections for SAPI = 0.

The channel assignment procedure is always initiated by the network.


3.4.3.1	Channel assignment initiation

The network initiates the channel assignment procedure by sending an ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message to the mobile station on the main signalling link. It then starts timer T3107.

  NOTE:	The network should take into account limitations of certain mobile stations to understand formats used in the Frequency List IE and Cell Channel Description IE used in the ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message, see sub-clause 10.5.2.13 and sub-clause 10.5.2.1b.

When sending this message on the network side, and when receiving it on the mobile station side, all transmission of signalling layer messages except for those RR messages needed for this procedure and for abnormal cases is suspended until resumption is indicated. These RR messages can be deduced from sub-clauses 3.4.3 and 8.8 Radio Resource management.

Upon receipt of the ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message, the mobile station initiates a local end release of link layer connections and packet resources, if in dual transfer mode, disconnects the physical channels, commands the switching to the assigned channels and initiates the establishment of lower layer connections (this includes the activation of the channels, their connection and the establishment of the main signalling links).

The ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message contains the description of the new configuration, including for the multislot configuration and the TCH/H + TCH/H + ACCHs configuration, the exact ACCHs to be used and a power command. The power level defined in this power command shall be used by the mobile station for the initial power on the new channel(s). It shall not affect the power used on the old channel(s). The message may also contain definitions of the channel mode to be applied for one or several channel sets. If a previously undefined channel set is defined by the ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message, a definition of the channel mode for the new channel set shall be included in the message.

If the channel mode to be applied corresponds to an initial assignment of a multi-rate speech codec, the ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message shall contain the MultiRate Configuration IE, which defines the set of codec modes and related information to use on the new channel.

If the assignment is related to an intra-cell handover from a multi-rate speech codec to a multi-rate speech codec, the MultiRate Configuration IE shall be included in the case of full rate to half rate or in the case of a change of multi-rate speech version. If not included in those cases, the mobile station shall behave as if the MultiRate Configuration IE was inconsistent. If not included in other cases, the MS shall use on the new channel the AMR configuration it was using on the old channel when it received the ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message.

An ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message may indicate a frequency change in progress, with a starting time and possibly alternative channel descriptions.

In the case of the reception of an ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message which contains only the description of a channel to be used after the starting time, the mobile station shall wait up to the starting time before accessing the channel. If the starting time has already elapsed, the mobile shall access the channel as an immediate reaction to the reception of the message (see 3GPP TS 45.010 for the timing constraints).

If the message contains both the description of a channel to be used after the indicated time and of a channel to be used before, the mobile station accesses a channel as an immediate reaction to the reception of the message. If the moment the mobile station is ready to access is before the indicated time, the mobile station accesses the channels described for before the starting time. The mobile station then changes to the channel described for after the starting time at the indicated time. New parameters can be frequency list, MAIO and HSN. Other parameters describing the allocated channels must be identical to the parameters described for before the starting time. If the moment the mobile station is ready to access is after the starting time, the mobile station accesses the channel described for after the starting time.

If frequency hopping is applied, the cell allocation if present in the message is used to decode the mobile allocation. If the cell allocation is not included, the mobile station uses its current cell allocation, the current CA is the last CA received on the BCCH. Afterward, the current CA may be changed by some messages sent on the main signalling link containing a CA (the possible messages are: ASSIGNMENT COMMAND, HANDOVER COMMAND and FREQUENCY REDEFINITION). Note that there are cases in which the current CA is undefined, see sub-clause 3.4.3.3.

The ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message may contain a cipher mode setting IE. In that case, this ciphering mode has to be applied on the new channel. If no such information is present, the ciphering mode and the use of Selective Ciphering of Downlink SACCH (see sub-clause 3.4.7a) are the same as on the previous channel. In either case the ciphering key shall not be changed as long as the key length remains unchanged. However, in case of a switch between ciphering algorithms requiring different key lengths, i.e. 64 or 128 bits, a change from the 64 bit key to the 128 bit key or vice versa must be performed. If the cipher mode setting IE indicates "start ciphering" the mobile station supporting Selective Ciphering of Downlink SACCH shall be able to decode both ciphered and not-ciphered SACCH blocks (see sub-clause 3.4.7a). The ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message shall not contain a cipher mode setting IE that indicates "start ciphering" unless a CIPHERING MODE COMMAND message has been transmitted earlier in the RR connection or ciphering has been started earlier in UTRAN: if such an ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message is received it shall be regarded as erroneous, an ASSIGNMENT FAILURE with cause "Protocol error unspecified" message shall be returned immediately, and no further action taken.

In a voice group call, the ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message may contain a VGCS target mode information element defining which RR mode is to be used on the new channel (i.e. dedicated mode or group transmit mode). If this information element is not present, the mode shall be assumed to be the same as on the previous channel. When the VGCS target mode information element indicates that the RR mode of the new channel is group transmit mode the information element shall also indicate the group cipher key number for the group cipher key to be used on the new channel or if the new channel is non ciphered. If the information element is not present, the ciphering mode and group cipher key shall be the same as on the previous channel. Additionally, when the RR mode of the new channel is group transmit mode and the group cipher key number indicates that the new channel is ciphered (ie group key number is non zero), then the VGCS Ciphering Parameters Information Element shall be included to provide the VSTK_RAND and Cell_Global_Count. Mobile stations not supporting VGCS talking shall ignore the ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message if the VGCS target mode information element or the VGCS Ciphering Parameters Information Element are included in the message and shall send an RR STATUS message to the network with cause #96. If the ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message contains a cipher mode setting information element together with either a VGCS target mode information element indicating a RR mode of group transmit mode, or a VGCS Ciphering Parameters information element, then a mobile station supporting VGCS talking shall regard the message as erroneous, an ASSIGNMENT FAILURE message with cause "Protocol error unspecified" shall be returned immediately, and no further action taken.

If the ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message assigns a VGCS mobile station to a dedicated channel, then the message may contain a cipher mode setting IE. In that case, this ciphering mode has to be applied on the new channel. If no such information is present, the ciphering mode is the same as on the previous channel, provided that the previous channel was also a dedicated channel. If no such information is present and the RR mode of the previous channel was group transmit mode, the new ciphering mode is "no ciphering". In either case the ciphering key to be used on the dedicated channel is the individual GSM ciphering key. The ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message shall not contain a cipher mode setting IE that indicates "start ciphering" unless a CIPHERING MODE COMMAND message has been transmitted earlier in the RR connection or a group cipher key number different from zero has been transmitted for this voice group call. If an ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message is received that contains a cipher mode setting IE indicating "start ciphering" and the mobile station has received neither a CIPHERING MODE COMMAND message in the RR connection, nor a group cipher key number different from zero for this voice group call, via any channel, then the ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message shall be considered as erroneous, the mobile station shall send an ASSIGNMENT FAILURE with cause "Protocol error unspecified", and no further action taken.

When the VGCS Ciphering Parameters are included in the Assignment Command the MS shall adjust and maintain the Cell Global Count using the procedure described in sub-clause 3.3.3.1. The MS shall then calculate the ciphering keys as described in 3GPP TS 43.020. Also, the MS shall fetch from the USIM the identity of its ciphering algorithm to use on the resource, as described in 3GPP TS 43.020.


3.4.3.2	Assignment completion

After the main signalling link is successfully established, the mobile station returns an ASSIGNMENT COMPLETE message, specifying cause "normal event", to the network on the main DCCH.

The sending of this message on the mobile station side and its receipt on the network side allow the resumption of the transmission of signalling layer messages other than those belonging to RR management.

At the receipt of the ASSIGNMENT COMPLETE message, the network releases the previously allocated resources and stops timer T3107.


3.4.3.3	Abnormal cases

If the mobile station has no current CA and if it needs a CA to analyse the ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message, it stays on the current channel(s) and sends an ASSIGNMENT FAILURE message with cause "no cell allocation available".

If the ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message instructs the mobile station to use a Channel Description or Mode that it does not support, or if the Channel Mode to use is not defined for all channel sets, then the mobile station shall return an ASSIGNMENT FAILURE message with cause "channel mode unacceptable", and the mobile station shall remain on the current channel(s) and uses the old Channel Description or Channel Mode(s).

If the mobile station receives an ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message containing an inconsistent MultiRate Configuration IE, then the mobile station shall return an ASSIGNMENT FAILURE message with cause "channel mode unacceptable", and the mobile station shall remain on the current channel(s) and uses the old Channel Description or Channel Mode(s).

The MultiRate Configuration IE shall be considered as inconsistent by the MS if:

  -	the active set does not include any codec mode or the active set includes more than four codec modes; or

  -	one or more codec modes of the active codec set are not supported by the assigned channel; or

  -	the threshold and hysteresis values are not set according to requirements given in 3GPP TS 45.009.

If during the initial assignment of the multirate speech the mobile station receives an ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message and the MultiRate Configuration IE is not present, then the mobile station shall return an ASSIGNMENT FAILURE message with cause "channel mode unacceptable", and the mobile station shall remain on the current channel(s) and uses the old Channel Description or Channel Mode(s).

If the ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message instructs the mobile station to use a frequency that it is not capable of, then the mobile station shall return an ASSIGNMENT FAILURE message with cause "frequency not implemented", and the mobile station shall remain on the current channel(s).

If the mobile station receives an ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message with a Frequency List IE indicating frequencies that are not all in one band, then the mobile station shall stay on the current channel(s) and send an ASSIGNMENT FAILURE message with cause "frequency not implemented". If the mobile station receives an ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message with a Mobile Allocation IE indexing frequencies that are not all in one band, then the mobile station shall stay on the current channel(s) and send an ASSIGNMENT FAILURE message with cause "frequency not implemented".

  NOTE:	An ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message sent to a multi band mobile station shall not be considered invalid because it indicates frequencies that are all in a different frequency band to that of the current channel.

On the mobile station side, if a lower layer failure happens on the new channel before the ASSIGNMENT COMPLETE message has been sent, the mobile station deactivates the new channels, reactivates the old channels, reconnects the TCHs if any and triggers the establishment of the main signalling link. It then sends a ASSIGNMENT FAILURE message, cause "protocol error unspecified" on the main DCCH and resumes the normal operation, as if no assignment attempt had occurred. The operational parameters (e.g. ciphering mode) when returning on the old channel are those applied before the procedure.

When receiving the ASSIGNMENT FAILURE message, the network stops T3107.

If a lower layer failure happens while attempting to connect back to the old channels, the radio link failure procedure is applied (see sub-clause 3.4.13.2 for dedicated mode and sub-clause 3.4.13.5 for group transmit mode).

On the network side, if timer T3107 elapses before either the ASSIGNMENT COMPLETE message has been received on the new channels or an ASSIGNMENT FAILURE message is received on the old channels, the old channels and the new channels are released if they both were dedicated channels and, unless the mobile station has re-established the call, all contexts related to the connections with that mobile station are cleared. If one of the channels was a VGCS channel, it shall be maintained and the uplink shall be set free. If both channels were VGCS channels, the network shall maintain one of the channels and the uplink shall be set free.

On the network side, lower layer failure occurring on the old channels after the sending of the ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message are ignored. Lower layer failures occurring after the receipt of the SABM Frame on the new main signalling link are treated following the general rules (cf. sub-clause 3.5.2).


3.4.4	Handover procedure

In dedicated mode, dual transfer mode or group transmit mode, an intercell or intracell change of channel(s) can be requested by the network RR sublayer. This change may be performed through the handover procedure. In case of intercell change in dual transfer mode, the DTM handover procedure can be used to change one dedicated channel together with one or more packet data channels (see sub-clause 3.7).

The network RR sublayer shall not request an intercell or intracell change of channel when a mobile station has temporarily entered the dedicated mode on a SDCCH, in order to initiate a priority uplink request.

For a talker in group transmit mode, the network RR sublayer shall delay the allocation of resources for handover of the talker to the voice group call channel of the target cell if the uplink of the target cell has already been granted to a subscriber with priority (this collision case may occur if the network supports uplink access option (i) as defined in 3GPP TS 43.068). If the allocation of the uplink to the new subscriber is confirmed, the network shall cancel the handover resource request and release the current talker. If the request for the uplink is rejected, the network proceeds with the handover of the current talker. Alternatively instead of delaying the handover, it may be continued to a different cell if possible.

  NOTE:	The decision to do a handover and the choice of the new cell is out of the scope of this technical specification.

The purpose of the handover procedure is to completely modify the channels allocated to the mobile station e.g. when the cell is changed. A change in the channel configuration nature is possible. This procedure is used only while in dedicated mode, dual transfer mode or group transmit mode.

The handover procedure shall not be used for changing between dependent configurations (see sub-clause 3.4.3).

The handover procedure includes:

  -	The suspension of normal operation except for RR management (layer 3).

  -	The disconnection of the main signalling link, and of the other links via local end release (layer 2), and the disconnection of the TCH(s) if any.

  -	The abortion of the packet resources (see 3GPP TS 44.060), if in class A mode of operation.

  -	The disconnection and the deactivation of previously assigned channels and their release (layer 1).

  -	The activation of the new channels, and their connection if applicable.

  -	The triggering of the establishment of data link connection for SAPI = 0 on the new channels.

The handover procedure is always initiated by the network.


3.4.4.1	Handover initiation

The network initiates the handover procedure by sending a HANDOVER COMMAND message to the mobile station on the main DCCH. It then starts timer T3103.

The network should not initiate a handover which may result in the transmission of a HANDOVER ACCESS message by the MS (see sub-clauses 3.4.4.2.1, 3.4.4.2.2, 3.4.4.2.3, 3.4.4.2.4) if the new traffic channel is in VAMOS mode. If it is determined from the HANDOVER COMMAND message that the assigned traffic channel is potentially in VAMOS mode (e.g. TSC Set 2 assigned, or VAMOS mode signaled), this shall not be considered as an error.

If the HANDOVER COMMAND message refers to a cell to which the mobile station is not synchronised to, this shall not be considered as an error (see 3GPP TS 45.008).

  NOTE:	The network should take into account limitations of certain mobile stations to understand formats used in the Frequency List IE, Frequency Short List IE, and Cell Channel Description IE used in the HANDOVER COMMAND message, see sub-clause 10.5.2.13, sub-clause 10.5.2.14, and sub-clause 10.5.2.1b.

When sending this message on the network side, and when receiving it on the mobile station side, all transmission of signalling layer messages except for those RR messages needed for this procedure and for abnormal cases, is suspended until resuming is indicated. These RR messages can be deduced from sub-clauses 3.4.3 and 8.5.1 "Radio Resource management".

Upon receipt of the HANDOVER COMMAND message, the mobile station initiates, as described in sub-clause 3.1.4, the release of link layer connections, disconnects the physical channels (including the packet resources, if in class A mode of operation), commands the switching to the assigned channels and initiates the establishment of lower layer connections (this includes the activation of the channels, their connection and the establishment of the data links).

The HANDOVER COMMAND message contains:

  -	The characteristics of the new channels, including for the multislot configuration and the TCH/H + TCH/H + ACCHs configuration the exact ACCHs to be used. The message may also contain definitions of the channel mode to be applied for one or several channel sets. If a previously undefined channel set is defined by the HANDOVER COMMAND message, a definition of the channel mode for the new channel set shall be included in the message.

  -	The characteristics of the new cell that are necessary to successfully communicate (e.g. frequency list in the case of slow frequency hopping), including the data that allows the mobile station to use the pre-knowledge about synchronization it acquires by the measurement process (i.e. BSIC + BCCH frequency).

  -	A power command (cf. 3GPP TS 45.008). The power level defined in this power command shall be used by the mobile station for the initial power on the new channel(s). It shall not affect the power used on the old channel(s).

  -	An indication of the physical channel establishment procedure to be used.

  -	A handover reference, used as specified in the following sub-clause. The choice of the handover reference by the network is out of the scope of this specification and left to the manufacturers.

  -	Optionally a timing advance to be used on the new cell.

  -	Optionally a cipher mode setting. In that case, this ciphering mode has to be applied on the new channel. If no such information is present, the ciphering mode is the same as on the previous channel. In either case the ciphering key shall not be changed as long as the key length remains unchanged. However, in case of a switch between ciphering algorithms requiring different key lengths, i.e. 64 or 128 bits, a change from the 64 bit key to the 128 bit key or vice versa must be performed. If the cipher mode setting IE indicates "start ciphering" the mobile station supporting Selective Ciphering of Downlink SACCH shall be able to decode both ciphered and not-ciphered SACCH blocks (see sub-clause 3.4.7a). In the case of GERAN A/Gb mode to GERAN A/Gb mode handover, if the HANDOVER COMMAND message contains a cipher mode setting IE that indicates "start ciphering" and neither an RR Ciphering Mode Setting procedure (see sub-clause 3.4.7) nor a UTRAN RRC Security Mode Control procedure (see 3GPP TS 25.331) has been successfully completed prior to the handover for this CS connection the HANDOVER COMMAND message shall be regarded as erroneous, a HANDOVER FAILURE message with cause "Protocol error unspecified" shall be returned immediately, and no further action taken. In the case of UTRAN to GERAN A/Gb mode handover or GERAN Iu mode to GERAN A/Gb mode handover or E-UTRAN to GERAN A/Gb mode SRVCC handover (see 3GPP TS 23.216 [94], 3GPP TS 29.280 [95]), the HANDOVER COMMAND message, which is sent transparently via RNC/BSC/eNB from BSS to the mobile station, shall always contain the cipher mode setting IE to indicate the ciphering mode to be used in GERAN A/Gb mode. If the cipher mode setting IE indicates "start ciphering" and neither an RR Ciphering Mode Setting procedure (see sub-clause 3.4.7) nor a UTRAN RRC Security Mode Control procedure (see 3GPP TS 25.331) has been successfully completed prior to the handover for this CS connection, the HANDOVER COMMAND message shall be regarded as erroneous and the applicable procedure as specified in 3GPP TS 25.331 for the case of an Invalid HANDOVER FROM UTRAN COMMAND message shall be followed; a HANDOVER FAILURE message with cause "Protocol error unspecified" shall be included in the HANDOVER FROM UTRAN FAILURE message. In the case of CDMA2000 to GERAN A/Gb mode handover, the HANDOVER COMMAND message, which is sent transparently via RNC from BSS to the mobile station, shall always contain the cipher mode setting IE.

  -	Optionally, in a voice group call, a VGCS target mode information element defining which RR mode is to be used on the new channel (i.e. dedicated mode or group transmit mode). If this information element is not present, the mode shall be assumed to be the same as on the previous channel. When the RR mode on the new channel is group transmit mode, the VGCS target mode information element shall also indicate the group cipher key number for the group cipher key to be used on the new channel or if the new channel is non ciphered. Additionally, when the RR mode is group transmit mode and the group cipher key number is non zero, then the VGCS Ciphering Parameters information element shall contain the CELL_GLOBAL_COUNT and optionally contain the VSTK_RAND, the target cell identity, the cell’s location area. If the VGCS target mode information element is not present, the ciphering mode and ciphering key shall be assumed to be the same as on the previous channel. If any of the following parameters are not included in the VGCS Ciphering Parameters information element, the parameter shall be assumed to be the same as on the previous channel: VSTK_RAND, the target cell identity, or the cell's location area. The network shall include the VSTK_RAND (within the VGCS Ciphering Parameters IE) if the group call is ciphered, the new RR mode is group transmit mode and the old RR mode is dedicated mode or is not known. Mobile stations not supporting VGCS talking shall ignore the HANDOVER COMMAND message if the VGCS target mode information element or VGCS Ciphering Parameters information element is included in the message and shall send an RR STATUS message to the network with cause #96. If the HANDOVER COMMAND message contains a cipher mode setting information element together with either a VGCS target mode information element indicating a RR mode of group transmit mode, or a VGCS Ciphering Parameters information element, , then a mobile station supporting VGCS talking shall regard the message as erroneous, an HANDOVER FAILURE message with cause "Protocol error unspecified" shall be returned immediately, and no further action taken.

  -	Optionally, in a voice group call, if the RR mode of the new channel is dedicated mode, a cipher mode setting IE. In that case, this ciphering mode shall be applied on the new channel. If no such information is present, the ciphering mode is the same as on the previous channel, provided that the previous channel was also a dedicated channel. If no such information is present and the previous channel had RR mode group transmit mode, the new ciphering mode is "no ciphering". In either case the ciphering key to be used on the dedicated channel is the individual GSM ciphering key. The HANDOVER COMMAND message shall not contain a cipher mode setting IE that indicates "start ciphering", unless a CIPHERING MODE COMMAND message has been transmitted earlier in the RR connection or a group cipher key number different from zero has been transmitted for this voice group call. If a HANDOVER COMMAND message is received that contains a cipher mode setting IE indicating "start ciphering" and the mobile station has received neither a CIPHERING MODE COMMAND message earlier in the RR connection nor a group cipher key number different from zero for this voice group call, via any channel, then the HANDOVER COMMAND message shall be considered as erroneous, the mobile station shall send an HANDOVER FAILURE with cause "Protocol error unspecified", and no further action taken.

  -	Optionally, when the channel mode indicates that a multi-rate speech codec must be applied, the MultiRateconfiguration to be used in the new cell. The MultiRate Configuration IE defines the set of codec mode and related information to use after the handover. When accessing the new channel, the mobile station shall use for the Initial Codec Mode the mode specified in the MultiRate Configuration IE, if present, or apply by default the implicit rule defined in 3GPP TS 45.009.

  -	Optionally, if the network supports dedicated mode MBMS notification and the mobile previously completed the service information sending to the network, an indication of whether the service information sending should be completed on the main DCCH of the new cell.

  -	Optionally, if the target network and the MS support network sharing and DTM, the PLMN Index corresponding to the selected PLMN.

In addition, a HANDOVER COMMAND message may indicate a frequency change in progress, with a starting time and possibly alternative channel descriptions.

In the case of the reception of a HANDOVER COMMAND message which contains only the description of a channel to be used after the starting time, the mobile station shall wait up to the starting time before accessing the channel. If the starting time has already elapsed, the mobile shall access the channel as an immediate reaction to the reception of the message (see 3GPP TS 45.010 for the timing constraints).

In the case of a handover towards a GERAN cell to which the mobile station is not synchronised to and in the case of an intersystem handover to GERAN, at the reception of a HANDOVER COMMAND message which contains only the description of a channel to be used after the starting time, the mobile station shall wait up to the starting time before accessing the new channel. If the starting time has already elapsed, the mobile shall access the new channel as an immediate reaction to the reception of the message (see 3GPP TS 45.010 for the timing constraints). Between the reception of the HANDOVER COMMAND and the starting time there is no requirement for the mobile station to receive or transmit on the old channel.

  NOTE:	This case may result to a long interruption and should not be used.

If the message contains both the description of a channel to be used after the indicated time and of a channel to be used before, the mobile station accesses a channel as an immediate reaction to the reception of the message. If the moment the mobile station is ready to access is before the indicated time, the mobile station accesses the channels described for before the starting time. The mobile station then changes to the channel described for after the starting time at the indicated time. New parameters can be frequency list, MAIO and HSN. Other parameters describing the allocated channels must be identical to the parameters described for before the starting time. If the moment the mobile station is ready to access is after the starting time, the mobile station accesses the channel described for after the starting time.

In the case of a handover from a GERAN cell, if the channel mode indicates that a multi-rate speech codec must be applied, and the MultiRateConfiguration IE is not included in the HANDOVER COMMAND message, then the mobile station shall use on the new channel the AMR configuration it was using on the old channel when it received the HANDOVER COMMAND message. The MultiRate Configuration IE shall be included in the case of full rate channel to half rate channel handover or in the case of a change of multi-rate speech version.. If not included in thosecases, the mobile station shall behave as if the MultiRate Configuration IE was inconsistent (see sub-clause 3.4.4.4).

In the case of an intersystem handover to GERAN, if the channel mode indicates that a multi-rate speech codec must be applied, the MultiRateConfiguration IE shall be included in the HANDOVER COMMAND message. If not included the mobile station shall treat the HANDOVER COMMAND message as invalid and shall perform the corresponding RRC error handling, see 3GPP TS 25.331.

In the case of a VGCS talker that is handed over to a ciphered VGCS group channel the MS shall calculate the voice group ciphering keys from the following parameters, as described in 3GPP TS 43.020:

  -	VSTK_RAND;

  -	CGI	(as supplied in the Handover Command);

  -	CELL_GLOBAL_COUNT (value of parameter in the target cell, as supplied in the Handover Command);

  -	Group Cipher Key Number (value obtained via the Handover Command);

  -	B22_COUNT - Bit 22 of COUNT ( as defined in 3GPP TS 43.020).

The Handover Command message shall provide the VGCS talker with the above parameters if the values have changed on handover or if the MS was not using VGCS/VBS ciphering prior to handover.

When the VGCS talker is handed over to a channel that is ciphered with VGCS ciphering, the talker adjust and maintain the CELL_GLOBAL_COUNT provided in the Handover Command message as described in sub-clause 3.3.3.1. Also, this talker shall fetch from the USIM the identity of its ciphering algorithm to use on the new resource, as described in 3GPP TS 43.020.

In the case of a VGCS talker that is handover a dedicated channel, the setting of the Cipher Mode IE in the Handover Command message shall indicate if the dedicated resource is ciphered. If the new resource is ciphered then the MS shall assume the following:

  -	the Cipher Mode Setting IE shall indicate the identity of the ciphering algorithm to use on the dedicated channel;. If this information is not present the MS shall use the algorithm that was last used when on a ciphered dedicated channel;

  -	the ciphering key sequence number shall be the same value as when the MS was last used on a ciphered dedicated channel.


3.4.4.2	Physical channel establishment

Four procedures are defined. The support of three of them is mandatory in the mobile station. The pseudo-synchronization case is optional in the mobile station. A pseudo-synchronized handover can be commanded only to a mobile station that can support it, as indicated in the classmark.


3.4.4.2.1	Finely synchronized cell case

If the mobile station knows that the timing advance with the new cell is not out of range, i.e. smaller than or equal to the maximum timing advance that can be coded as specified in 3GPP TS 44.004, or if the new cell does accept out of range timing advance as indicated in the HANDOVER COMMAND message, the mobile station proceeds as follows.

After having switched to the assigned channels, the mobile station sends four times the HANDOVER ACCESS message in four successive layer 1 frames on the main DCCH. This message is sent in an access burst. Its content is reduced to the handover reference information element. The transmission of these four messages is optional if so indicated by the network in the HANDOVER COMMAND message.

Before completion of the 4 access bursts on the DCCH, additional access bursts may also be sent on the SACCH.

In those cells that support extended TA values if TA value in new cell is greater than 63 and the HANDOVER COMMAND message indicates that the transmission of four HANDOVER ACCESS messages is optional the MS shall not transmit these four messages. MS shall not send additional bursts on the SACCH.

It then activates the channels in sending and receiving mode and connects the channels if need be.

If applicable, ciphering is immediately started . The access bursts are not ciphered, including when sent on the group channel.


3.4.4.2.2	Non synchronized cell case

After having switched to the assigned channels, the mobile station starts repeating the HANDOVER ACCESS message in successive layer 1 frames on the main DCCH and optionally on the SACCH. This message is sent in an access burst. Its content is reduced to the handover reference information element. The mobile station starts timer T3124 at the start point of the timeslot in which the HANDOVER ACCESS message is sent the first time on the main DCCH.

The mobile station then activates the channels in receiving mode and connects the channels if need be (only for reception).

If applicable, deciphering is then immediately started . The access bursts are not ciphered, including when sent on the group channel.

When the network has the RF characteristics that are necessary, it sends in unacknowledged mode a PHYSICAL INFORMATION message to the mobile station on the main DCCH. If applicable, ciphering and deciphering is immediately started (i.e., before even the reception of a correct access burst), and the message is sent enciphered.

The PHYSICAL INFORMATION message contains various physical layer related information, allowing a proper transmission by the mobile station.

When sending the PHYSICAL INFORMATION message, the network starts timer T3105. If this timer times out before the reception of a correctly decoded layer 2 frame in format A or B (see 3GPP TS 44.006), or a correctly decoded TCH frame from the mobile station, the network repeats the PHYSICAL INFORMATION message and restarts timer T3105. The maximum number of repetitions is Ny1.

The correct decoding of a frame means that the decoding algorithm and the error detection tests, if any, indicate no error.

When the mobile station receives a PHYSICAL INFORMATION message, it stops timer T3124, stops sending access bursts, activates the physical channels in sending and receiving mode and connects the channels if need be. If the allocated channel is an SDCCH (+ SACCH), performance of the mobile station must enable the mobile station to accept a correct PHYSICAL INFORMATION message sent by the network in any block while T3124 is running.


3.4.4.2.3	Pseudo-synchronized cell case

The details of the use of this procedure are described in 3GPP TS 45.010. The mobile station computes the timing advance to be used with the new cell from the real time difference value given in the HANDOVER COMMAND message. If the mobile station knows that the timing advance with the new cell is not out of range , i.e. smaller or equal to the maximum timing advance that can be coded as specified in 3GPP TS 44.004, or if the new cell accepts an out of range timing advance as indicated in the HANDOVER COMMAND message, the mobile station switches to the new channel and proceeds as follows.

After having switched to the assigned channels, the mobile station sends in four successive slots on the main DCCH a HANDOVER ACCESS message. This message is sent in random mode and thus does not follow the basic format. Its content is reduced to the handover reference information element. The transmission of these four messages is optional if so indicated by the network in the HANDOVER COMMAND message.

Before completion of the 4 access bursts on the DCCH, additional access bursts may also be sent on the SACCH.

In those cells that support extended TA values if TA value in new cell is greater than 63 and the HANDOVER COMMAND message indicates that the transmission of four HANDOVER ACCESS messages is optional the MS shall not transmit these four messages. The MS shall not send additional bursts on the SACCH.

The mobile station then activates the channels in sending and receiving mode and connects the channels if need be. The mobile station may activate the channels in receiving mode and connect the channels while sending access bursts.

If applicable, ciphering is then immediately started. The access bursts are not ciphered, including when sent on the group channel.


3.4.4.2.4	Pre-synchronized cell case

The details of the use of this procedure are described in 3GPP TS 45.010. The mobile station switches to the new channel and proceeds as follows.

After having switched to the assigned channels, the mobile station sends in four successive slots on the main DCCH a HANDOVER ACCESS message. This message is sent in an access burst and thus does not follow the basic format. Its content is reduced to the handover reference information element. The transmission of these four messages is optional if so indicated by the network in the HANDOVER COMMAND message.

Before completion of the 4 access bursts on the DCCH, additional access bursts may also be sent on the SACCH.

In those cells that support extended TA values if TA value in new cell is greater than 63 and the HANDOVER COMMAND message indicates that the transmission of four HANDOVER ACCESS messages is optional the MS shall not transmit these four messages. MS shall not send additional bursts on the SACCH.

The mobile station then activates the channel in sending and receiving mode and connects the channels if need be. The timing advance value to be used with the new cell is:

  -	either the value contained in the HANDOVER COMMAND message if the timing advance information element is present; or

  -	the default value for pre-synchronized handover as defined in 3GPP TS 45.010, if the timing advance information element is not included in the HANDOVER COMMAND message. The MS may activate the channels in receiving mode and connect the channels while sending access bursts.

If applicable, ciphering is immediately started. The access bursts are not ciphered, including when sent on the group channel.


3.4.4.3	Handover completion

After lower layer connections are successfully established, the mobile station returns a HANDOVER COMPLETE message, specifying cause "normal event", to the network on the main DCCH.

The sending of this message on the mobile station side and its receipt on the network side allow the resumption of the transmission of signalling layer messages other than those for RR management.

When receiving the HANDOVER COMPLETE message, the network stops timer T3103 and releases the old channels.

If requested to do so in the HANDOVER COMMAND message, the mobile station includes the observed time difference it has measured when performing the handover, corrected by half the timing advance, in the HANDOVER COMPLETE message (detailed specifications are given in 3GPP TS 45.010).

If the new cell and the mobile station support DTM, the network shall send the DTM INFORMATION message on the main DCCH after the HANDOVER COMPLETE message has been received.


3.4.4.4	Abnormal cases

In the case of a synchronous or pseudo-synchronous handover, if the mobile station knows that the timing advance with the new cell is out of range, i.e. is bigger than the maximum timing advance that can be coded as specified in 3GPP TS 44.004, and if the new cell does not accept out of range timing advance as indicated in the HANDOVER COMMAND message, the mobile station sends a HANDOVER FAILURE message, cause "handover impossible, timing advance out of range", on the main signalling link and does not attempt that handover.

If the HANDOVER COMMAND message instructs the mobile station to use a Channel Description or Mode that it does not support, or if the Channel Mode to use is not defined for all channel sets, then the MS shall return a HANDOVER FAILURE message with cause "channel mode unacceptable", and the MS shall remain on the current channel(s) and uses the old Channel Description or Mode(s).

If the mobile station receives a HANDOVER COMMAND message containing an inconsistent MultiRateConfiguration IE, then the mobile station shall return a HANDOVER FAILURE message with cause "channel mode unacceptable", and the mobile station shall remain on the current channel(s) and uses the old Channel Description or Mode(s).

The MultiRate Configuration IE shall be considered as inconsistent by the MS if:

  -	the active set does not include any codec mode or the active set includes more than four codec modes; or

  -	one or more codec modes of the active codec set are not supported by the assigned channel; or

  -	the threshold and hysteresis values are not set according to requirements given in 3GPP TS 45.009.

If the HANDOVER COMMAND message instructs the mobile station to use a frequency that it is not capable of, then the mobile station shall return a HANDOVER FAILURE message with cause "frequency not implemented", and the mobile station shall remain on the current channel(s).

If the mobile station receives a HANDOVER COMMAND message with a Frequency List IE or Frequency Short List IE indicating frequencies that are not all in one band, then the mobile station shall stay on the current channel(s) and send a HANDOVER FAILURE message with cause "frequency not implemented". If the mobile station receives a HANDOVER COMMAND message with a Mobile Allocation IE indexing frequencies that are not all in one band, then the mobile station shall stay on the current channel(s) and send a HANDOVER FAILURE message with cause "frequency not implemented".

  NOTE:	A HANDOVER COMMAND message sent to a multi band mobile station shall not be considered invalid because it indicates target channel frequencies that are all in a different frequency band to that of the ARFCN in the Cell Description IE.

On the mobile station side, if timer T3124 times out (only in the non- synchronized case) or if a lower layer failure happens on the new channel before the HANDOVER COMPLETE message has been sent, the mobile station deactivates the new channels, reactivates the old channels, reconnects the TCHs if any and triggers the establishment of the main signalling link. It then sends a HANDOVER FAILURE message on the main signalling link and resumes normal operation as if no handover attempt had occurred. The operational parameters (e.g. ciphering mode) when returning on the old channel are those applied before the HANDOVER COMMAND message was received.

When the HANDOVER FAILURE message has been received, the network releases the new channels if they were dedicated channels and stops timers T3105 and stops T3103 in the non-synchronized case. If the new channels were VGCS channels, they shall be maintained.

If a DTM capable mobile station is in a cell supporting dual transfer mode and is in GMM READY state, it shall perform a Cell Update procedure immediately after sending the HANDOVER FAILURE message.

If a lower layer failure happens while attempting to connect back to the old channels, the standard rules are applied (cf. sub-clause 3.4.13.2 for dedicated mode and sub-clause 3.4.13.5 for group transmit mode).

On the network side, if timer T3103 elapses before either the HANDOVER COMPLETE message is received on the new channels, or a HANDOVER FAILURE message is received on the old channels, or the mobile station has re-established the call, the old channels are released if they were dedicated channels and all contexts related to the connections with that mobile station are cleared. If the old channel was a VGCS channel, it shall be maintained and the uplink shall be set free.

On the network side, if neither a correctly layer 2 frame in format A or B nor a correctly TCH frame have been received from the mobile station on the new channel, the newly allocated channels are released if they were dedicated channels. If the new channels were VGCS channels, they shall be maintained and the uplink shall be set free.

On the network side, lower layer failures occurring on the old channels after the sending of the HANDOVER COMMAND message are ignored. Lower layer failures occurring after the receipt of the SABM frame on the new main signalling link are treated following a general scheme (cf. sub-clause 3.4.13.2 for dedicated mode and sub-clause 3.4.13.5 for group transmit mode).


3.4.4a	Handover to UTRAN procedure

Only valid for a UTRAN capable MS. In dedicated mode or dual transfer mode, a change to UTRAN channel(s) can be requested by the network RR sublayer. This change is performed through the handover to UTRAN procedure.

  NOTE:	The decision to do a handover to UTRAN and the choice of the new cell is out of the scope of this technical specification.

The handover to UTRAN procedure includes:

  -	The suspension of normal operation except for RR management (layer 3);

  -	The disconnection of the main signalling link, and of the other links via local end release (layer 2), and the disconnection of the TCH(s) if any;

  -	The disconnection and the deactivation of previously assigned channels and their release (layer 1);

  -	The abortion of the packet resources (see 3GPP TS 44.060), if in class A mode of operation;

  -	The establishment of UTRAN channel(s), see 3GPP TS 25.331.

The handover to UTRAN procedure is always initiated by the network.


3.4.4a.1	Handover to UTRAN initiation

The network initiates the handover to UTRAN procedure by sending an INTER SYSTEM TO UTRAN HANDOVER COMMAND message to the mobile station on the main DCCH. It then starts timer T3121.

If the INTER SYSTEM TO UTRAN HANDOVER COMMAND refers to a not known cell (see 3GPP TS 25.133 and 3GPP TS 25.123), this shall not be considered as an error.

When sending this message on the network side, and when receiving it on the mobile station side, all transmission of signalling layer messages except for those RR messages needed for this procedure and for abnormal cases, is suspended until resuming is indicated. These RR messages can be deduced from sub-clause 3.4.3 and 8.5.1 "Radio Resource management".

Upon receipt of the INTER SYSTEM TO UTRAN HANDOVER COMMAND message, the mobile station initiates, as described in sub-clause 3.1.4, the release of link layer connections and disconnects the physical channels (including the packet resources, if in class A mode of operation). Switching to the assigned cell(s) and physical channel establishment is described in 3GPP TS 25.331.


3.4.4a.2	Handover to UTRAN completion

  NOTE:	After lower layer connections are successfully established, the mobile station returns a Handover to UTRAN Complete message on UTRAN channels(s), see 3GPP TS 25.331.

When receiving the Handover to UTRAN Complete message (3GPP TS 25.331), the network stops timer T3121 and releases the old channels.

If there are any upper layer messages for which LAPDm has not yet received acknowledgement from the network, the MS shall, after the handover has been successfully completed, send the messages to the network using the newly established radio connection to the UTRAN.


3.4.4a.3	Abnormal cases

If the INTER SYSTEM TO UTRAN HANDOVER COMMAND message instructs the mobile station to use a frequency that it is not capable of, then the mobile station shall stay on the current channel(s) and return a HANDOVER FAILURE message with cause "frequency not implemented".

If the INTER SYSTEM TO UTRAN HANDOVER COMMAND message instructs the mobile station to use a UTRAN predefined configuration that the mobile station has not read or instructs to use a default configuration not implemented by the mobile station, then the mobile station shall stay on the current channel(s) and return a HANDOVER FAILURE message with cause "UTRAN configuration unknown".

If connection is not possible on the UTRAN channel(s) (see 3GPP TS 25.331), the MS reactivates the old channel(s) and reconnects TCHs and triggers the establishment of the main signalling link. It then sends a HANDOVER FAILURE message on the main signalling link and resumes normal operation.

When sending a HANDOVER FAILURE message in response to an INTERSYSTEM TO UTRAN HANDOVER COMMAND, the mobile station shall erase all the UTRAN predefined configurations.

When the HANDOVER FAILURE message has been received, the network releases the UTRAN channel(s) if they were dedicated channels and stops timer T3121.

If a lower layer failure happens while attempting to connect back to the old channels, the standard rules are applied (cf. sub-clause 3.4.13.2 for dedicated mode).

On the network side, if timer T3121 elapses before either the Handover to UTRAN Complete (3GPP TS 25.331) message is received on the UTRAN channel(s), or a HANDOVER FAILURE message is received on the old channels, or the mobile station has re-established the call, the old channels are released if they were dedicated channels and all contexts related to the connections with that mobile station are cleared.

On the network side, lower layer failures occurring on the old channels after the sending of the INTER SYSTEM TO UTRAN HANDOVER COMMAND message are ignored.


3.4.4b	Handover to CDMA2000 procedure

Only valid for a CDMA2000 capable MS. In dedicated mode or dual transfer mode, a change to CDMA2000 channel(s) can be requested by the network RR sublayer. This change is performed through the handover to CDMA2000 procedure.

  NOTE:	The decision to do a handover to CDMA2000 and the choice of the new cell is out of the scope of this technical specification.

The handover to CDMA2000 procedure includes:

  -	The suspension of normal operation except for RR management (layer 3);

  -	The disconnection of the main signalling link, and of the other links via local end release (layer 2), and the disconnection of the TCH(s) if any;

  -	The disconnection and the deactivation of previously assigned channels and their release (layer 1);

  -	The abortion of the packet resources (see 3GPP TS 44.060), if in class A mode of operation;

  -	The establishment of CDMA2000 channel(s), see TIA/EIA/IS-833 and TIA/EIA/IS-2000-5-A.

The handover to CDMA2000 procedure is always initiated by the network.


3.4.4b.1	Handover to CDMA2000 initiation

The network initiates the handover to CDMA2000 procedure by sending an INTER SYSTEM TO CDMA2000 HANDOVER COMMAND message to the mobile station on the main DCCH. It then starts timer T3123.

If the INTER SYSTEM TO CDMA2000 HANDOVER COMMAND refers to a not known base station (see TIA/EIA/IS-98-D), this shall not be considered as an error.

When sending this message on the network side, and when receiving it on the mobile station side, all transmission of signalling layer messages except for those RR messages needed for this procedure and for abnormal cases, is suspended until resuming is indicated. These RR messages can be deduced from sub-clause 3.4.3 and 8.5.1 "Radio Resource management".

Upon receipt of the INTER SYSTEM TO CDMA2000 HANDOVER COMMAND message, the mobile station initiates, as described in sub-clause 3.1.4, the release of link layer connections and disconnects the physical channels (including the packet resources, if in class A mode of operation). Switching to the assigned base stations and physical channel establishment is described in TIA/EIA/IS-2000-5-A.


3.4.4b.2	Handover to CDMA2000 completion

  NOTE:	After lower layer connections are successfully established, the mobile station returns a Handoff Completion Message on CDMA2000 channels(s), see TIA/EIA/IS-833.

When receiving the Handoff Completion Message (TIA/EIA/IS-833), the network stops timer T3123 and releases the old channels.


3.4.4b.3	Abnormal cases

If the INTER SYSTEM TO CDMA2000 HANDOVER COMMAND message instructs the mobile station to use a frequency that it is not capable of, then the mobile station shall return a HANDOVER FAILURE message with cause "frequency not implemented", and the mobile station shall remain on the current channel(s).

If connection is not possible on the CDMA2000 channel(s) (see TIA/EIA/IS-2000-5-A), the MS reactivates the old channels, reconnects TCHs and triggers the establishment of the main signalling link. It then sends a HANDOVER FAILURE message on the main signalling link and resumes normal operation.

When the HANDOVER FAILURE message has been received, the network releases the CDMA2000 channel(s) if they were dedicated channels and stops timer T3123.

If a lower layer failure happens while attempting to connect back to the old channels, the standard rules are applied (cf. sub-clause 3.4.13.2 for dedicated mode).

On the network side, if timer T3123 elapses before either the Handoff Completion Message (TIA/EIA/IS-833) is received on the CDMA2000 channel(s), or a HANDOVER FAILURE message is received on the old channels, or the mobile station has re-established the call, the old channels are released if they were dedicated channels and all contexts related to the connections with that mobile station are cleared.

On the network side, lower layer failures occurring on the old channels after the sending of the INTER SYSTEM TO CDMA2000 HANDOVER COMMAND message are ignored.


3.4.4c	Intermode handover to GERAN Iu mode procedure


3.4.4c.1	General

This sub-clause is only valid for a GERAN Iu mode capable MS. In dedicated mode or dual transfer mode, a change to GERAN Iu mode channel(s) can be requested by the network RR sublayer. This change is performed through the intermode handover to GERAN Iu procedure.

  NOTE:	The decision to do a handover to GERAN Iu mode and the choice of the new cell is out of the scope of this technical specification.

The handover to GERAN Iu mode procedure includes:

  -	The suspension of normal operation except for RR management (layer 3);

  -	The disconnection of the main signalling link, and of the other links via local end release (layer 2), and the disconnection of the TCH(s) if any;

  -	The disconnection and the deactivation of previously assigned channels and their release (layer 1);

  -	The abortion of the packet resources (see 3GPP TS 44.060), if in class A mode of operation;

  -	The establishment of the channel(s) in GERAN Iu mode, see 3GPP TS 44.118.


3.4.4c.2	Initiation of the handover to GERAN Iu mode procedure

The network initiates the handover to GERAN Iu mode procedure by sending an HANDOVER TO GERAN Iu MODE COMMAND message to the mobile station on the main DCCH. It then starts timer T3121.

If the HANDOVER TO GERAN Iu MODE COMMAND message refers to a not known cell (see 3GPP TS 45.008), this shall not be considered as an error.

When sending this message on the network side, and when receiving it on the mobile station side, all transmission of signalling layer messages except for those RR messages needed for this procedure and for abnormal cases, is suspended until resumption is indicated. These RR messages can be deduced from sub-clause 3.4.3 and sub-clause 8.5.1.

Upon receipt of the HANDOVER TO GERAN Iu MODE COMMAND message, the mobile station initiates, as described in sub-clause 3.1.4, the release of link layer connections and disconnects the physical channels (including the packet resources, if in class A mode of operation). Switching to the assigned cell(s) and physical channel establishement is described in 3GPP TS 44.118.


3.4.4c.3	Completion of the Handover to GERAN Iu Mode procedure

  NOTE:	After lower layer connections are successfully established, the mobile station returns a RADIO BEARER RECONFIGURATION COMPLETE message on GERAN Iu mode, see 3GPP TS 44.118.

When receiving the RADIO BEARER RECONFIGURATION COMPLETE message (3GPP TS 44.118), the network stops timer T3121 and releases the old channels.


3.4.4c.4	Abnormal cases

If the intermode HANDOVER TO GERAN Iu MODE COMMAND message instructs the mobile station to use a frequency that it is not capable of, then the mobile station shall stay on the current channel(s) and return a HANDOVER FAILURE message with cause "frequency not implemented".

If connection is not possible on the channel(s) in GERAN Iu mode (see 3GPP TS 44.118), the MS reactivates the old channel(s) and reconnects TCHs and triggers the establishment of the main signalling link. It then sends a HANDOVER FAILURE message on the main signalling link and resumes normal operation.

When the HANDOVER FAILURE message has been received, the network releases the new channel(s) if they were dedicated channels and stops timer T3121.

If a lower layer failure happens while attempting to connect back to the old channels, the standard rules are applied (cf. sub-clause 3.4.13.2 for dedicated mode).

On the network side, if timer T3121 expires, the old channels are released if they were dedicated channels and all contexts related to the connections with that mobile station are cleared.

On the network side, lower layer failures occurring on the old channels after the sending of the HANDOVER TO GERAN Iu MODE COMMAND message are ignored.


3.4.4d	CS to PS SRVCC procedure

This procedure is only valid for a CS to PS SRVCC capable MS. In dedicated mode or dual transfer mode, a change to E-UTRAN / UTRAN PS bearer can be requested by the network RR sublayer. This change is performed through the CS to PS SRVCC procedure.

The CS to PS SRVCC procedure includes:

  -	The suspension of normal operation except for RR management (layer 3);

  -	The disconnection of the main signalling link, and of the other links via local end release (layer 2), and the disconnection of the TCH(s) if any;

  -	The disconnection and the deactivation of previously assigned channels and their release (layer 1);

  -	The abortion of the packet resources (see 3GPP TS 44.060), if applicable;

  -	The establishment of E-UTRAN / UTRAN PS bearers, see 3GPP TS 36.331, 3GPP TS 25.331.

The SRVCC to E-UTRAN/UTRAN procedure is always initiated by the network. The decision to perform CS to PS SRVCC procedure and the choice of the new cell is out of the scope of this technical specification.

In case of dual transfer mode, when this procedure is initiated there is no handover functionality related to the PS domain (i.e. no PS Handover is initiated and the CS to PS SRVCC procedure is therefore the same for both dedicated mode and dual transfer mode).


3.4.4d.1	CS to PS SRVCC procedure initiation

The network initiates the CS to PS SRVCC procedure by sending an INTER SYSTEM TO E-UTRAN HANDOVER COMMAND or INTER SYSTEM TO UTRAN HANDOVER COMMAND message to the mobile station on the main DCCH. The network then starts timer T3121.

If the INTER SYSTEM TO UTRAN HANDOVER COMMAND refers to an unknown cell (see 3GPP TS 25.133 and 3GPP TS 25.123), this shall not be considered as an error.

When sending one of these messages on the network side, and when receiving it on the mobile station side, all transmission of signalling layer messages, except for those RR messages needed for this procedure and for abnormal cases, is suspended until resumption is indicated. These RR messages can be deduced from sub-clause 3.4.3 and 8.5.1 "Radio Resource management".

Upon receipt of the INTER SYSTEM TO E-UTRAN HANDOVER COMMAND or INTER SYSTEM TO UTRAN HANDOVER COMMAND message, the mobile station initiates, as described in sub-clause 3.1.4, the release of link layer connections and disconnects the physical channels (including the packet resources, if applicable).

Switching to the assigned cell(s) and physical channel establishment in E-UTRAN or UTRAN is described in 3GPP TS 36.331 and 3GPP TS 25.331.


3.4.4d.2	CS to PS SRVCC procedure completion

  NOTE:	After lower layer connections are successfully established, the mobile station sends a RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete message on E-UTRAN channels(s), see 3GPP TS 36.331 or a Handover to UTRAN Complete message on UTRAN channel(s), see 3GPP TS 25.331.

When receiving the RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete message (3GPP TS 36.331), the network stops timer T3121 and releases the old channels.

When receiving the Handover to UTRAN Complete message (3GPP TS 25.331), the network stops timer T3121 and releases the old channels.

If there are any upper layer messages for which LAPDm has not yet received acknowledgement from the network, the MS shall, after the handover has been successfully completed, discard these messages.


3.4.4d.3	Abnormal cases

For CS to PS SRVCC to UTRAN (HSPA) the same abnormal cases as defined in 3.4.4a.3 apply.

If the INTER SYSTEM TO E-UTRAN HANDOVER COMMAND message instructs the mobile station to use a frequency that it is not capable of, then the mobile station shall stay on the current channel(s) and return a HANDOVER FAILURE message with cause "frequency not implemented".

If connection is not possible on the E-UTRAN channel(s) (see 3GPP TS 36.331), the MS reactivates the old channel(s) and reconnects TCHs and triggers the establishment of the main signalling link. It then sends a HANDOVER FAILURE message on the main signalling link and resumes normal operation.

When the HANDOVER FAILURE message has been received, the network releases the E-UTRAN dedicated bearer and stops timer T3121.

If a lower layer failure happens while attempting to connect back to the old channels, the standard rules are applied (cf. sub-clause 3.4.13.2 for dedicated mode).

On the network side, if timer T3121 elapses before either the RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete (3GPP TS 36.331) message is received on the E-UTRAN channel(s), or a HANDOVER FAILURE message is received on the old channels, or the mobile station has re-established the call, the old channels are released if they were dedicated channels and all contexts related to the connections with that mobile station are cleared.

On the network side, lower layer failures occurring on the old channels after the sending of the INTER SYSTEM TO E-UTRAN HANDOVER COMMAND message are ignored.


3.4.5	Frequency redefinition procedure

In dedicated mode, dual transfer mode and group transmit mode, this procedure is used by the network to change the frequencies and hopping sequences of the allocated channels. This is meaningful only in the case of frequency hopping.

The network sends to the mobile station a FREQUENCY REDEFINITION message containing the new parameters together with a starting time indication.

  NOTE:	The network should take into account limitations of certain mobile stations to understand formats used in the Cell Channel Description IE used in the FREQUENCY REDEFINITION message, see sub-clause 10.5.2.13.

For a mobile in dual transfer mode with resources assigned on two channels, the Frequency redefinition procedure may be applied to either or both channels.

When receiving such a message, the mobile station modifies the frequencies/hopping sequences it uses at the exact indicated time slot, i.e. the indicated time slot is the first with new parameters. All other functions are not disturbed by this change. New parameters can be the cell channel description, the mobile allocation and the MAIO. In case of multislot configuration, the Channel Description IE shall describe the channel carrying the main signalling link, the new parameters however, shall be used for all assigned timeslots. Other parameters describing the allocated channels must be identical to the current parameters.


3.4.5.1	Abnormal cases

If the mobile station receives a FREQUENCY REDEFINITION message with a Mobile Allocation IE indexing frequencies that are not all in one band and a Starting Time IE indicating a time that has not elapsed, then the mobile station shall stay on the current channel(s) and send a RR STATUS message with cause "frequency not implemented".

If the mobile station receives a FREQUENCY REDEFINITION message with a Mobile Allocation IE indexing frequencies that are not all in one band and a Starting Time IE indicating a time that has elapsed, then the mobile station shall locally abort the radio connection and, if permitted, attempt Call Re-establishment.

If the mobile station receives a FREQUENCY REDEFINITION message on a channel for which it has a pending redefinition (defined by the immediate assignment, assignment or handover procedure or a previous frequency redefinition procedure) the frequencies, hopping and starting time parameters defined by the new frequency redefinition procedure supersedes those of the pending one.

  NOTE:	A FREQUENCY REDEFINITION message sent to a multi band mobile station shall not be considered invalid because it indicates new frequencies that are all in a different frequency band to that of the ARFCN of the serving cell.

If the mobile station in dual transfer mode with assigned resources on two channels receives a FREQUENCY REDEFINITION message which neither contains a Carrier Indication IE nor contains frequency parameters for both carriers (i.e. the Channel Description C2 and the Mobile Allocation C2 IEs are not included), then the mobile station shall stay on the current channel(s) and send a RR STATUS message with cause "semantically incorrect message".


3.4.6	Channel mode modify procedure

In dedicated mode, dual transfer mode or group transmit mode, higher layers can request the setting of the channel mode.

The channel mode modify procedure allows the network to request the mobile station to set the channel mode for one channel or one channel set. The procedure shall not be used if the multislot configuration contains more than one channel set. The channel mode covers the coding, decoding and transcoding mode used on the indicated channel.

This message shall not be used to modify the mode of a non-multislot configured traffic channel when the MS has requested a multislot configuration, ie it cannot be used to modify the mode of a traffic channel when the channel was assigned during the immediate assignment procedure and the user has requested a multislot configuration.

This procedure is always initiated by the network.

  NOTE:	Direct transitions between full rate speech coder version 1 and full rate speech coder version 2 (and vice versa) may cause unpleasant audio bursts.


3.4.6.1	Normal channel mode modify procedure


3.4.6.1.1	Initiation of the channel mode modify procedure

The network initiates the procedure by sending a CHANNEL MODE MODIFY message to the mobile station. This message contains:

  -	a channel description of the channel(s) on which the mode in the CHANNEL MODE MODIFY message shall be applied; and

  -	the mode to be used on that channel, or on all the channels of a channel set in a multislot configuration.

  -	Optionally, when the channel mode indicates that a multi-rate speech codec must be applied, the MultiRateconfiguration to be used. The MultiRateConfiguration IE defines the set of codec modes and related information to use after the mode modify procedure.

If the channel mode is changed from a non multi-rate speech codec to a multi-rate speech codec or if the channel mode is changed from a multi-rate speech codec to another mutli-rate speech version but the old multi-rate speech version and the new multi-rate speech version are not the same, the CHANNEL MODE MODIFY message shall contain the MultiRate Configuration IE, which defines the set of codec modes and related information to use as a new mode.

If the old channel mode and the new channel mode are both multi-rate speech codec and if the old multi-rate speech version and the new multi-rate speech version are the same, the MultiRate Configuration IE may not be present. If not present, the MS shall go on with the current multi-rate speech configuration.


3.4.6.1.2	Completion of channel mode modify procedure

When it has received the CHANNEL MODE MODIFY message, the mobile station sets the mode for the indicated channel, and if that is in a multislot configuration, the whole channel set and then replies by a CHANNEL MODE MODIFY ACKNOWLEDGE message indicating the ordered channel mode.

This applies whether the mode commanded by the CHANNEL MODE MODIFY is different from the one used by the mobile station or whether it is already in use.


3.4.6.1.3	Abnormal cases

If the new mode is multi-rate speech codec and if the MultiRate Configuration IE is inconsistent, the MS shall ignore the CHANNEL MODE MODIFY message and shall not send CHANNEL MODE MODIFY ACKNOWLEDGE message to the network.

No other specific action for a lower layer failure is specified in this sub-clause. If the mobile station does not support the indicated mode, it shall retain the old mode and return the associated channel mode information in the CHANNEL MODE MODIFY ACKNOWLEDGE message.


3.4.6.2	Channel mode modify procedure for a voice group call talker


3.4.6.2.1	Initiation of the channel mode modify procedure

The network initiates the procedure by sending a CHANNEL MODE MODIFY message to the mobile station. This message contains:

  -	a channel description of the channel on which the CHANNEL MODE MODIFY message is sent; and

  -	the new channel mode to be used on the channel; and

  -	optionally, the VGCS target mode information element defining which RR mode (i.e. dedicated mode or group transmit mode) is to be used with the new channel mode. If this information element is not present, the RR mode shall be assumed to be the same as with the previous channel mode. The VGCS target mode information element shall also indicate the group cipher key number for the group cipher key to be used after the channel mode change. If the information element is not present, the ciphering mode and ciphering key shall be the same as with the previous channel mode. Mobile stations not supporting VGCS talking shall ignore the CHANNEL MODE MODIFY message if the VGCS target mode information element is included in the message and shall send an RR STATUS message to the network with cause #96.

When the RR mode to be used after the channel mode change is group transmit mode and the group cipher key number indicates that the resource is ciphered (ie group key number is non zero), then the VGCS Ciphering Parameters Information Element shall be included to provide the VSTK_RAND and Cell_Global_Count. The MS shall adjust and maintain the Cell Global Count using the procedure described in sub-clause 3.3.3.1. The MS shall then calculate the ciphering keys as described in 3GPP TS 43.020. Also, the MS shall fetch from the USIM the identity of its ciphering algorithm to use on the resource, as described in 3GPP TS 43.020.

When the RR mode used before the channel mode change and the RR mode to be used after the channel mode change are both dedicated mode and the channel was ciphered before the channel mode change, then new channel shall continue to be ciphered after the channel mode change with the same ciphering algorithm and ciphering keys as previously used.

If a VGCS target mode information element indicating a RR mode of dedicated mode and a non zero group cipher key number is included, the mobile station shall behave as if it would not support the indicated channel mode.


3.4.6.2.2	Completion of mode change procedure

When it has received the CHANNEL MODE MODIFY message, the mobile station changes the mode for the indicated channel and then replies by a CHANNEL MODE MODIFY ACKNOWLEDGE message indicating the new channel mode.


3.4.6.2.3	Abnormal cases

No specific action for a lower layer failure is specified in this sub-clause. If the mobile station does not support the indicated mode, it shall retain the old mode and return the associated channel mode information in the CHANNEL MODE MODIFY ACKNOWLEDGE message.


3.4.7	Ciphering mode setting procedure

In dedicated mode, the ciphering mode setting procedure is used by the network to set the ciphering mode, i.e. whether or not the transmission is ciphered, and if so which algorithm to use. The procedure shall only be used to change from "not ciphered" mode to "ciphered" mode, or vice-versa, or to pass a CIPHERING MODE COMMAND message to the mobile station while remaining in the "not ciphered" mode. The ciphering mode setting procedure is always triggered by the network and it only applies to dedicated resources.

The cipher mode setting procedure shall not be applied in group transmit mode.


3.4.7.1	Ciphering mode setting initiation

The network initiates the ciphering mode setting procedure by sending a CIPHERING MODE COMMAND message to the mobile station on the main signalling link, indicating whether ciphering shall be used or not, and if yes which algorithm to use.

Additionally, the network may, by the use of the cipher response information element, request the mobile station to include its IMEISV in the CIPHERING MODE COMPLETE message.

The new mode is applied for reception on the network side after the message has been sent.


3.4.7.2	Ciphering mode setting completion

Whenever the mobile station receives a valid CIPHERING MODE COMMAND message, it shall, if a SIM is present and considered valid by the ME and the ciphering key sequence number stored on the SIM indicates that a ciphering key is available, load the ciphering key stored on the SIM into the ME. A valid CIPHERING MODE COMMAND message is defined to be one of the following:

  -	one that indicates "start ciphering" and is received by the mobile station in the "not ciphered" mode;

  -	one that indicates "no ciphering" and is received by the MS in the "not ciphered" mode; or

  -	one that indicates "no ciphering" and is received by the mobile station in the "ciphered" mode.

Other CIPHERING MODE COMMAND messages shall be regarded as erroneous, an RR STATUS message with cause "Protocol error unspecified" shall be returned, and no further action taken.

Upon receipt of the CIPHERING MODE COMMAND message indicating ciphering, the mobile station shall start transmission and reception in the indicated mode. A mobile station supporting Selective Ciphering of Downlink SACCH shall be able to decode both ciphered and not-ciphered SACCH blocks (see sub-clause 3.4.7a).

When the appropriate action on the CIPHERING MODE COMMAND has been taken, the mobile station sends back a CIPHERING MODE COMPLETE message. If the "cipher response" field of the cipher response information element in the CIPHERING MODE COMMAND message specified "IMEI must be included" the mobile station shall include its IMEISV in the CIPHERING MODE COMPLETE message.

Upon receipt of the CIPHERING MODE COMPLETE message or any other correct layer 2 frame which was sent in the new mode, the network starts transmission in the new mode.

[pic]

Figure 3.4.7.2.1: Ciphering mode setting sequence

Upon starting ciphering with algorithm A5/1, the network may change the contents of the Neighbour Cell Description and Neighbour Cell Description 2 information elements and SI 6 Rest Octets spare padding (see sub-clauses 10.5.2.22, 10.5.2.22a and 10.5.2.35a, respectively) in the System Information messages to be sent to the mobile station, compared to those sent prior to ciphering and (for the Neighbour Cell Description and Neighbour Cell Description 2 information elements) those broadcast on the BCCH. In this case, such changes should be performed immediately after reception of the CIPHERING MODE COMPLETE message by the network.


3.4.7a	Selective Ciphering of Downlink SACCH

Selective Ciphering of Downlink SACCH, when ciphering is started between the network and the mobile station in dedicated mode or dual-transfer mode, refers to the mechanism used by the network in downlink to cipher or not to cipher any given individual SACCH block selectively according to its content; and to the ability of the mobile station to decode downlink SACCH blocks whether any given individual SACCH block is ciphered or not.

The use of Selective Ciphering of Downlink SACCH is under control of the network. The network may use Selective Ciphering of Downlink SACCH only if supported by the mobile station, as indicated in the MS Classmark 3 IE (see 3GPP TS 24.008). The network shall ensure that when Selective Ciphering of Downlink SACCH is used, it is used as long as ciphering is active during the RR connection.

If Selective Ciphering of Downlink SACCH is used, the network shall ensure that:

  -	a SACCH block shall not be ciphered if it contains any of the following RR messages: SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 5, SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 5bis, SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 5ter, SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 6, SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 14, MEASUREMENT INFORMATION, EXTENDED MEASUREMENT ORDER; and

  -	a SACCH block shall be ciphered if it contains SAPI 3 data (SMS), see 3GPP TS 44.006, optionally it should not be ciphered if carrying a CP-Ack message (see 3GPP TS 24.011).

A mobile station that supports Selective Ciphering of Downlink SACCH may use the above information to deter mine if Selective Ciphering of Downlink SACCH is used or not.


3.4.8	Additional channel assignment procedure

  NOTE:	In the present state of 3GPP TS 44.003, this procedure is only possible for the TCH/H + ACCHs to TCH/H + TCH/H + ACCHs transition. As a consequence it is not needed for simple mobile stations. The description of the procedure is in general terms to cope with possible evolution.

In dedicated mode, a change of channel configuration to include an additional channel can be requested by upper layers.

The additional channel assignment procedure shall not be applied in group transmit mode,

The purpose of the additional assignment procedure is to allocate an additional dedicated channel to a mobile station while keeping the previously allocated channels. In particular the main DCCH and the SACCH are not modified, and signalling exchanges are not interrupted.

The additional assignment procedure may happen only in dedicated mode. It is used for instance for the transition from the TCH/H + ACCHs configuration to the TCH/H + TCH/H + ACCHs configuration.

The additional assignment procedure is always initiated by the network.


3.4.8.1	Additional assignment procedure initiation

The network initiates the procedure by sending an ADDITIONAL ASSIGNMENT message to the mobile station on the main DCCH. The ADDITIONAL ASSIGNMENT message contains the description of the newly assigned channel.

On receipt of the message, the mobile station activates the new channel.


3.4.8.2	Additional assignment procedure completion

The mobile station sends an ASSIGNMENT COMPLETE message to the network on the channel, on which it receives the ADDITIONAL ASSIGNMENT message.


3.4.8.3	Abnormal cases

A lower layer failure occurring during the procedure is treated according to the general case (see sub-clause 3.4.13.2).

The network considers the channel as allocated from the sending of the ADDITIONAL ASSIGNMENT message. As a consequence, if a re-establishment occurs, the network will consider the context as if the mobile station has received the message, and the new configuration allocated after the re-establishment may differ from the one the mobile station had before the re-establishment.


3.4.9	Partial channel release procedure

In dedicated mode, a change of channel configuration to release one channel can be requested by upper layers.

The partial channel release procedure shall not be applied in group transmit mode.

The purpose of this procedure is to deactivate part of the dedicated channels in use. The channel configuration remains dedicated.

  NOTE:	In the present state of 3GPP TS 44.003, this procedure is only possible for the TCH/H + TCH/H + ACCHs to TCH/H + ACCHs transition. As a consequence it is not needed for simple mobile stations.

The partial release procedure is always initiated by the network.


3.4.9.1	Partial release procedure initiation

The network initiates the partial release by sending a PARTIAL RELEASE message to the mobile station on the main DCCH.

On receipt of the PARTIAL RELEASE message the mobile station:

  -	Initiates the disconnection of all the link layer connections carried by the channel to be released;

  -	Simultaneously initiates the connection on remaining channels of the data link layer connections that have been released;

  -	Deactivates the physical channels to be released;

  -	Sends a PARTIAL RELEASE COMPLETE to the network on the (possibly new) main signalling link.


3.4.9.2	Abnormal cases

A lower layer failure is treated following the general rules as specified in sub-clause 3.4.13.2.

Moreover, on the network side, the channel configuration nature is set from the sending of the PARTIAL RELEASE message onward. As a consequence, any new assignment after a re-establishment may concern a different channel configuration nature from the one known by the mobile station before the re-establishment.


3.4.10	Classmark change procedure

In dedicated mode or in group transmit mode, this procedure allows the mobile station to indicate to the network a change of characteristics reflected in the classmark (e.g. due to addition of power amplification). Furthermore, a mobile station which implements the "controlled early classmark sending" option may also send a CLASSMARK CHANGE message and/or a UTRAN CLASSMARK CHANGE message and/or a CDMA2000 CLASSMARK CHANGE message and/or a GERAN IU MODE CLASSMARK CHANGE message as described in sub-clause 3.3.1.1.4.1, even if no change of characteristics has occurred.

The mobile station sends a CLASSMARK CHANGE message to the network. This message contains the new mobile station classmark 2 information element. It may also contain a Classmark 3 Information Element. There is no acknowledgement from the network at layer 3.

A UTRAN capable MS, independently of sending a CLASSMARK CHANGE message, sends a UTRAN CLASSMARK CHANGE message to the network. This message contains the INTER RAT HANDOVER INFO defined in 3GPP TS 25.331. There is no acknowledgement from the network at layer 3.

  NOTE:	For the network, UTRAN predefined configuration status information may be invalid if the PLMN where predefined configurations were read and the PLMN of the connected cell do not use common predefined configurations.

A CDMA2000 capable MS sends a CDMA2000 CLASSMARK CHANGE message to the network.

A GERAN Iu mode capable MS, independently of sending a CLASSMARK CHANGE message, sends a GERAN IU MODE CLASSMARK CHANGE message to the network. This message contains the MS GERAN IU MODE RADIO ACCESS CAPABLITY IE defined in 3GPP TS 44.118. There is no acknowledgement from the network at layer 3.

If the CLASSMARK CHANGE and one or more of these additional messages are to be sent by the MS, the CLASSMARK CHANGE message shall be sent first.


3.4.11	Classmark interrogation procedure

This procedure allows the network to request additional classmark information from the mobile station (e.g. if the information initially sent by the mobile station is not sufficient for network decisions). For a multi-RAT MS this procedure allows in addition the network to request INTER RAT HANDOVER INFO or CDMA2000 MS Capability information and/or GERAN Iu mode MS radio capability.


3.4.11.1	Classmark interrogation initiation

The network initiates the classmark interrogation procedure by sending a CLASSMARK ENQUIRY message to the mobile station on the main DCCH.


3.4.11.2	Classmark interrogation completion

On receipt of the CLASSMARK ENQUIRY message the mobile station sends a CLASSMARK CHANGE and/or a UTRAN CLASSMARK CHANGE and/or a CDMA2000 CLASSMARK CHANGE and/or a GERAN IU MODE CLASSMARK CHANGE message to the network on the main DCCH. The Classmark Enquiry Mask information element in the CLASSMARK ENQUIRY message indicates the type of request. If the Classmark Enquiry Mask information element is not included in the CLASSMARK ENQUIRY message, this indicates a request for CLASSMARK CHANGE message.

The CLASSMARK CHANGE message contains the mobile station classmark 2 information element. It may also contain a Classmark 3 Information Element.

The UTRAN CLASSMARK CHANGE message contains the INTER RAT HANDOVER INFO (UTRAN specific information).

The CDMA2000 CLASSMARK CHANGE message contains CDMA2000 UE capability information.

The GERAN IU MODE CLASSMARK CHANGE message contains MS GERAN IU MODE RADIO ACCESS CAPABILITY IE (see 3GPPP TS 44.118).

If the CLASSMARK CHANGE and one or more of these additional messages are to be sent by the MS, the CLASSMARK CHANGE message shall be sent first.


3.4.12	Indication of notifications and paging information

Only applicable for mobile stations supporting VGCS or VBS.

In dedicated mode or in group transmit mode, the RR entity shall provide indications to the upper layer on all received notifications for voice group calls or voice broadcast calls according to the VGCS or VBS subscription data stored in the mobile station. The indication shall include the notified group or broadcast call reference and possibly the related priority VSTK_RAND and CELL_GLOBAL_COUNT, if provided.

In group transmit mode, if the mobile station has decoded a paging message with the own mobile station identity on the PCH or on the voice group call channel downlink, the RR entity shall provide an indication to the upper layers, together with the related priority, if applicable.

In group transmit mode, if the RR entity receives information on the voice group call channel of the existence of a paging message in its paging subgroup of the PCH, the RR entity shall pass this information to the upper layers together with the related priority if provided (see also sub-clauses 3.3.2 and 3.3.3).

In group transmit mode, when a paging message that contains an indication of the paging is received on the VBS or VGCS channel, this indication shall be passed to the upper layer. If no paging cause is present in the paging message the VBS/VGCS mobile station shall assume that the paging is for a mobile terminating call.


3.4.13	RR connection release procedure


3.4.13.1	Normal release procedure

The release of the RR connection can be requested by upper layers.

The purpose of this procedure is to deactivate all the dedicated channels in use. When the channels are released and the mobile station is not IMSI attached for GPRS services (clause 4), the mobile station returns to the CCCH configuration, idle mode.

If the mobile station is IMSI attached for GPRS services the following four cases apply:

  -	If the mobile station has no radio resources (i.e., no temporary block flow) allocated on a PDCH, the mobile station returns to the PCCCH or CCCH configuration, packet idle mode;

  -	If the mobile station is operating in dual transfer mode when the RR connection is released, the radio resources allocated on a PDCH are released, the mobile station returns to the PCCCH or CCCH configuration, packet idle mode;

  -	If the mobile station is operating in dual transfer mode when the RR connection is released and the mobile station and the network support enhanced DTM CS release procedure, the mobile station may maintain its radio resources allocated on one or more PDCH(s) and enter packet transfer mode;

  -	Otherwise, if the mobile station has radio resources allocated on a PDCH, the mobile station enters packet transfer mode.

The channel release procedure can be used in a variety of cases, including TCH release after a call release, and DCCH release when a dedicated channel allocated for signalling is released.

In dedicated mode and group transmit mode, the channel release procedure is always initiated by the network.


3.4.13.1.1	Channel release procedure initiation in dedicated mode and in group transmit mode

The network initiates the channel release by sending a CHANNEL RELEASE message to the mobile station on the main DCCH, starts timer T3109 and deactivates the SACCH.

On receipt of a CHANNEL RELEASE message the mobile station starts timer T3110 and disconnects the main signalling link. When T3110 times out, or when the disconnection is confirmed, the mobile station deactivates all channels, considers the RR connection as released, and returns to CCCH idle mode, returns to PCCCH or CCCH packet idle mode or enters packet transfer mode.

  NOTE 1:	Data Links other than the main signalling link are disconnected by local end link release.

If case of dedicated mode, on the network side, when the main signalling link is disconnected, the network stops timer T3109 and starts timer T3111. When timer T3111 times out, the network deactivates the channels, they are then free to be allocated to another connection.

  NOTE 2:	The sole purpose of timer T3111 is to let some time to acknowledge the disconnection and to protect the channel in case of loss of the acknowledge frame.

If timer T3109 times out, the network deactivates the channels; they are then free to be allocated to another connection.

The CHANNEL RELEASE message will include an RR cause indication as follows:

  #0:	if it is a normal release, e.g. at the end of a call or at normal release of a DCCH.

  #1:	to indicate an unspecified abnormal release.

  #2, #3 or #4:	to indicate a specific release event.

  #5:	if the channel is to be assigned for servicing a higher priority call (e.g. an emergency call).

  #65:	if e.g. a handover procedure is stopped because the call has been cleared.

The CHANNEL RELEASE message may include the information element BA Range which may be used by a mobile station in its selection algorithm (see 3GPP TS 45.008 and 3GPP TS 23.022).

The CHANNEL RELEASE message may include the information element "Cell selection indicator after release of all TCH and SDCCH" which shall be used by the mobile station in its cell selection algorithm after release of all TCH and SDCCH (see 3GPP TS 45.008).

The CHANNEL RELEASE message may include Individual priorities IE to convey individual priorities information to the MS (see subclause 3.2.3.3). When the MS receives an Individual priorities IE it shall start an instance of timer T3230 with the value supplied in the Individual priorities IE.

If the network redirects a mobile station towards E-UTRAN, it proceeds as follows:

  -	The network shall use the information element "Cell selection indicator after release of all TCH and SDCCH" in the channel release message for redirection towards an EARFCN in the E-UTRAN band numbered less than 65.

  -	The network shall use the information element "individual priorities" in the channel release message for redirection towards an EARFCN in the E-UTRAN band numbered greater than 64.

Mobile stations not supporting VGCS or VBS listening shall ignore Group Channel Description (or Group Channel Description 2), Group Cipher Key Number, Cell Channel Description, Talker Identity and Talker Priority Status information elements if present in the message and perform the channel release procedure as normal.

For mobile stations supporting VGCS listening, the following procedures apply:

The CHANNEL RELEASE message may include the Group Channel Description, Group Channel Description 2, and possibly the Cell Channel Description information element(s). In this case, the mobile station shall release the layer 2 link, enter the group receive mode and give an indication to the upper layer. The BSS may provide the Group Channel Description 2 in the CHANNEL RELEASE message to the current talker only when the voice group call channel cannot be fully described by the Group Channel Description IE and the Cell Channel Description IE. If a CHANNEL RELEASE message with neither Group Channel Description, nor Group Channel Description 2, nor Cell Channel Description is received, or if those information elements do not properly specify a group channel, the normal behaviour applies.

If ciphering is applied on the VGCS or VBS channel, the network shall provide in the CHANNEL RELEASE message with the Group Cipher Key Number information element for the group cipher key to be used by the mobile station for reception of the VGCS or VBS channel. If this information element is not included, no ciphering is applied on the VGCS or VBS channel. When the group cipher key indicates that the group call is ciphered (ie group key is non zero), then the VGCS Ciphering Parameters Information Element shall be included to provide the VSTK_RAND and Cell_Global_Count. The MS shall adjust and maintain the Cell Global Count using the procedure described in sub-clause 3.3.3.1. The MS shall then calculate the ciphering keys as described in 3GPP TS 43.020. Also, the MS shall fetch from the USIM the identity of its ciphering algorithm to use on the VGCS or VBS channel, as described in 3GPP TS 43.020.

For mobile stations supporting VGCS talking, the following procedures apply:

If the VGCS talking subscriber is being pre-empted by a higher priority talker, then the network shall include the talker priority status information element. The network shall also include, when available, the talker identity associated with the new talker.

A mobile station not supporting the "GPRS" option shall consider the GPRS Resumption information element as an information element unknown in the CHANNEL RELEASE message and perform the RR connection release procedure as normal.

For a mobile station supporting the "GPRS" option, the following additional procedures also apply:

  -	The CHANNEL RELEASE message may include the information element GPRS Resumption. If the GPRS Resumption information element indicates that the network has resumed GPRS services, the RR sublayer of the mobile station shall indicate a RR GPRS resumption complete to the MM sublayer, see clause 4. If the GPRS Resumption information element indicates that the network has not successfully resumed GPRS services, the RR sublayer of the mobile station shall indicate a RR GPRS resumption failure to the MM sublayer, see clause 4.

  -	If the mobile station has performed the GPRS suspension procedure (see sub-clause 3.4.25) and the GPRS Resumption information element is not included in the message, the RR sublayer of the mobile station shall indicate a RR GPRS resumption failure to the MM sublayer, see clause 4.

  -	If the mobile station has not performed the GPRS suspension procedure and the GPRS Resumption information element is not included in the message, the mobile station shall perform the RR connection release procedure as normal.


3.4.13.1.1a	Channel release procedure initiation in dual transfer mode

If the mobile station and the network support enhanced DTM CS release procedure, the network may delay the release of the RR connection until the mobile station has received the needed system information, in order to maintain the radio resources on the PDCH(s) after the release of the RR connection.

The network initiates enhanced DTM CS release procedure by sending the PACKET CS RELEASE INDICATION message as specified in 3GPP TS 44.060.

If the acquisition of system information is completed, the network shall send a CHANNEL RELEASE message on the main DCCH with the Enhanced DTM CS Release Indication field indicating that the mobile station is allowed to continue in packet transfer mode after the release of the RR connection. Upon receipt of the CHANNEL RELEASE message the mobile station starts timer T3110 and disconnects the main signalling link. When T3110 times out, or when the disconnection is confirmed, the mobile station deactivates all dedicated channels, considers the RR connection as released and enters packet transfer mode.

The network may for any reason send a CHANNEL RELEASE message on the main DCCH with the Enhanced DTM CS Release Indication field indicating that the mobile station is not allowed to continue in packet transfer mode after the release of the RR connection. Upon receipt of the CHANNEL RELEASE message the mobile station starts timer T3110 and disconnects the main signalling link. When T3110 times out, or when the disconnection is confirmed, the mobile station deactivates all channels, considers the RR connection as released, and enters packet idle mode.


3.4.13.1.2	Abnormal cases

Abnormal cases are taken into account in the main part of the description of the procedure.


3.4.13.2	Radio link failure in dedicated mode or dual transfer mode

The main part of these procedures concerns the "normal" cases, i.e. those without any occurrence of loss of communication means. A separate paragraph at the end of the description of each procedure treats the cases of loss of communication, called a radio link failure. In dedicated mode, in most of the cases the reaction of the mobile station or the network is the same. Those reactions are described in this sub-clause to avoid repetitions.

A radio link failure can be detected by several ways:

  1)	By analysis of reception at layer 1, as specified in 3GPP TS 45.008 and sub-clause 3.4.1.1.

  2)	By a data link layer failure as specified in 3GPP TS 44.006, on the main signalling link. A data link failure on any other data link shall not be considered as a radio link failure.

  3)	When a lower layer failure happens while the mobile station attempts to connect back to the old channels in a channel assignment procedure, handover procedure, DTM handover procedure or DTM assignment procedure with relocation of the RR connection.

  4)	In some cases where timers are started to detect the lack of answer from the other party, as described in clause 3.

The two first cases are known by the term "lower layer failure".


3.4.13.2.1	Mobile side

When a radio link failure is detected by the mobile station,

  -	the MS shall perform a local end release on all signalling links unless otherwise specified;

  -	the mobile station shall deactivate all dedicated channels;

  -	if the mobile station is in dual transfer mode, it shall abort the packet resources;

  -	the RR sublayer of the mobile station shall indicate an RR connection failure to the MM sublayer unless otherwise specified.

  NOTE:	Upper layers may decide on a re-establishment (see 3GPP TS 24.008).

When a mobile station which has performed the GPRS suspension procedure (sub-clause 3.4.25) detects a radio link failure, the RR sublayer of the mobile station shall indicate a RR GPRS resumption failure to the MM sublayer, see clause 4.


3.4.13.2.2	Network side

In dedicated mode, the reaction of the network to a lower layer failure depends on the context. Except when otherwise specified, it is to release the connection either with the channel release procedure as specified in sub-clause 3.5.1, or with the following procedure. The network starts timer T3109 and deactivates the SACCH (and hence to stop transmission on the SACCH). If the mobile station is in dual transfer mode, the network also aborts all the allocated packet resources.

When a radio link failure has been detected, an indication is passed to the upper Mobility Management sublayer on the network side.

When timer T3109 expires, the network can regard the channels as released and free for allocation.

This procedure relies on the fact that if a mobile station does not receive the SACCH for some time, it completely releases the channels (cf. 3GPP TS 45.008).

  NOTE:	The network should maintain for a while the transaction context in order to allow call re-establishment. The length of timer is for further study.

When a mobile station which has performed the GPRS suspension procedure (sub-clause 3.4.25) detects a radio link failure, the RR sublayer of the mobile station shall indicate a RR GPRS resumption failure to the MM sublayer, see 3GPP TS 24.008.


3.4.13.3	RR connection abortion in dedicated mode or dual transfer mode

The mobile station aborts the RR connection by initiating a normal release of the main signalling link, performing local end releases on all other signalling links, disconnecting all traffic channels, if any, and aborting all the packet resources, if any.

When a mobile station which has performed the GPRS suspension procedure (sub-clause 3.4.25) aborts the RR connection, the RR sublayer of the mobile station shall indicate a RR GPRS resumption failure to the MM sublayer, see 3GPP TS 24.008.


3.4.13.4	Uplink release procedure

If the uplink release is requested by the upper layer in group transmit mode, the mobile station shall send an UPLINK RELEASE message on the voice group call channel uplink, perform a release of the main signalling link and go back to the group receive mode.

If the uplink release is requested by the upper layer when the VGCS talker is on a dedicated channel, the mobile station shall send an UPLINK RELEASE message on the dedicated channel. When a mobile station receives a CHANNEL RELEASE message from the network, the mobile station shall perform a release of the main signalling link. The mobile station enters group receive mode if the CHANNEL RELEASE message includes the Group Channel Description (or Group Channel Description 2) and possibly the Cell Channel Description information element(s), otherwise it enters idle mode.

If the UPLINK RELEASE message is received from the network on the voice group call channel downlink, the MS shall perform a release of the main signalling link and go back to the group receive mode.


3.4.13.5	Radio link failure in group transmit mode

The main part of these procedures concerns the "normal" cases, i.e. those without any occurrence of loss of communication means. A separate paragraph at the end of the description of each procedure treats the cases of loss of communication, called a radio link failure. In group transmit mode, in most of the cases the reaction of the mobile station or the network is the same. Those reactions are described in this sub-clause to avoid repetitions.

A radio link failure can be detected by several ways:

  1)	By analysis of reception at layer 1, as specified in 3GPP TS 45.008 and sub-clause 3.4.1.1.

  2)	By a data link layer failure as specified in 3GPP TS 44.006, on the main signalling link. A data link failure on any other data link shall not be considered as a radio link failure.

  3)	When a lower layer failure happens while the mobile station attempts to connect back to the old channels in a channel assignment procedure or handover procedure.

  4)	In some cases where timers are started to detect the lack of answer from the other party, as described in clause 3.

The two first cases are known by the term "lower layer failure".


3.4.13.5.1	Mobile side

When a radio link failure is detected by the mobile station:

  -	the MS shall perform a local end release on all signalling links;

  -	the mobile station shall go back to idle mode and, when possible, to group receive mode;

  -	the RR sublayer of the mobile station shall indicate an RR connection failure to the MM sublayer unless otherwise specified.


3.4.13.5.2	Network side

When the uplink has been allocated and the network detects a lower layer failure, the network shall set the uplink free and provide an UPLINK FREE message on the main signalling channel, when appropriate.

When a radio link failure has been detected, an indication is passed to the upper Mobility Management sublayer on the network side.


3.4.13.6	RR connection abortion requested by upper layers

The purpose of this procedure is to abort the RR connection and bar the current cell. The procedure is requested by upper layers when they determine that the network has failed an authentication check (see 3GPP TS 24.008).

On request of the upper layers the MS shall locally abort the RR connection and behave as if a lower layer failure has occurred. The MS shall treat the current cell as barred (see 3GPP TS 23.022).


3.4.14	Receiving a RR STATUS message by a RR entity.

If the RR entity of the mobile station receives a RR STATUS message no transition and no specific action shall be taken as seen from the radio interface, i.e. local actions are possible.

The actions to be taken on receiving a RR STATUS message in the network are an implementation dependent option see also clause 8.


3.4.15	Group receive mode procedures

Only applicable for support of VGCS listening or VBS listening.


3.4.15.1	Mobile station side


3.4.15.1.1	Reception of the VGCS or VBS channel


3.4.15.1.1.1	General

In group receive mode, the mobile station receives the downlink of the voice broadcast channel or voice group call channel for which the channel description was provided within the notification message or in the related command message. The mobile station should also listen to the CCCH of the serving cell. Moreover, it measures the received levels on the serving cell and on the neighbour cells to assess the need for a cell reselection as specified in 3GPP TS 45.008. The general cell reselection procedure for the mobile station in group receive mode is described in 3GPP TS 23.022. If the group call is ciphered then the MS on cell reselection shall recalculate the cipher keys and obtain the identity of its ciphering algorithm as described in sub-clause 3.4.15.1.1.2.

Information on neighbour cells used for cell reselection and reception of the VGCS or VBS channel in the neighbour cells may be provided on the downlink messages (see sub-clause 3.4.15.1.2). If no such information is provided or information is missing, the mobile station shall try to read this information on the BCCH and NCH of the neighbour cells.


3.4.15.1.1.2	Reception on ciphered VGCS or VBS channel

The MS shall derive the group cipher key using the following parameters:

  -	VSTK_RAND - obtained via the notification message;

  -	CELL_GLOBAL_COUNT - obtained via the NCH, Notification/FACCH or Paging Request Type 1;

  -	CGI - obtained via System Information 3 or 4;

  -	Group Cipher Key Number - obtained via the group call reference.

The derivation of the key from the above parameters is explained in 3GPP TS 43.020.

The MS shall obtain the identity of its ciphering algorithm from its USIM, as described in 3GPP TS 43.020.


3.4.15.1.2	Monitoring of downlink messages and related procedures

Mobile stations in group receive mode shall monitor messages related to the following procedures on the VGCS or VBS channel downlink and act appropriately in order to be able to keep receiving the VGCS or VBS channel downlink.

All messages for mobile stations in group receive mode shall be sent in UI format on the VGCS or VBS channel downlink. Mobile stations in group receive mode shall ignore all messages which are not sent in UI format or which are not related to the following mentioned procedures.

The mobile should also monitor messages on the PCH or NCH of the current cell.


3.4.15.1.2.1	(void)


3.4.15.1.2.2	(void)


3.4.15.1.2.3	Channel mode modify procedure

The mobile station shall receive CHANNEL MODE MODIFY messages. The mobile station shall use the new channel mode but shall not transmit any response to the network.


3.4.15.1.2.4	Notification and paging information

The mobile station shall monitor messages related to notification and paging procedures.

The RR entity shall provide indications on all received notifications for voice group calls or voice broadcast calls to the upper layer. The indication shall include the notified group or broadcast call reference and, if provided, and if the mobile station supports eMLPP the related priority.

On request by the upper layer to join another voice broadcast call or voice group call for which a corresponding notification has been received on the VGCS or VBS channel downlink, the RR entity shall read the corresponding notification on the NCH.

If the mobile station has received a paging message with its own mobile station identity on the PCH or on the voice broadcast channel or voice group call channel downlink, the RR entity shall provide an indication to the upper layers, together with the related priority, if applicable.

When a paging message that contains an indication of the paging cause (mobile terminating call or short message) is received on the VBS or VGCS channel, this indication shall also be passed to the upper layer. If no paging cause is present in the paging message the VBS/VGCS mobile station shall assume that the paging is for a mobile terminating call.


3.4.15.1.2.4.1	Use of Reduced NCH monitoring

This sub-clause applies to mobile stations which are in group receive mode or group transmit mode of dedicated mode and which in addition want to receive notification messages for other voice broadcast calls or voice group calls and which aim at reducing the reception load.

When the MS in group receive mode or group transmit mode enters a cell, it may read the NCH until it has received at least two messages on the NCH indicating NLN, with the two last received NLN being identical. Then it may stop reading the NCH until it receives on the SACCH an NLN(SACCH) different from the last previously received NLN.

For this, a parameter is provided on the SACCH in the SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 6 message:

  -	NLN(SACCH): Notification List Number.

If a mobile station receives on the SACCH an NLN(SACCH) different from the last received NLN it may read the NCH until it has received at least two messages on the NCH indicating NLN with the two last received NLN being identical.

If a message in the SACCH is not received correctly the MS may read the NCH until it has received at least two messages on the NCH indicating NLN, with the two last received NLN being identical.


3.4.15.1.2.5	Uplink status messages

Mobile stations supporting VGCS talking shall monitor the VGCS uplink control related messages UPLINK FREE and UPLINK BUSY.


3.4.15.1.2.6	Channel release message

The mobile station shall receive CHANNEL RELEASE messages. On receipt of a CHANNEL RELEASE message, the RR entity shall go to idle mode and give an indication to the upper layer. (See also sub-clause 3.4.15.1.4.1, 4th paragraph.)


3.4.15.1.2.7	Information on paging channel restructuring

On receipt of a SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 6 message indicating that paging channel restructuring has taken place, if the mobile station wants to be able to read its paging subchannel while in group receive mode or group transmit mode, the mobile station should read the related messages on the BCCH to know the position of its paging group.


3.4.15.1.3	Uplink reply procedure

In Group Receive mode, on receipt of an UPLINK FREE message with an uplink access request indication from the network on the voice group call channel downlink or voice broadcast channel downlink, the mobile station shall send two UPLINK ACCESS messages on the voice group call channel uplink or voice broadcast channel uplink with establishment cause "Reply on uplink access request" and then stop immediately transmitting on the uplink.

The first UPLINK ACCESS message shall be transmitted by the mobile station with a random delay between 0 and 20 ms. The second UPLINK ACCESS messages shall be repeated after a further period of 100 ms plus a random delay between 0 and 20 ms. The UPLINK ACCESS messages shall be sent unciphered.

If an uplink identity code (UIC) of the current cell has been provided by the network in the UPLINK FREE message, the mobile station shall use this UIC for the coding of the UPLINK ACCESS messages. If no UIC is provided, the mobile station shall use the BSIC received of the serving cell, for instance as received from the initial synchronization.


3.4.15.1.4	Leaving the group receive mode


3.4.15.1.4.1	Returning to idle mode

If the mobile station enters a new cell in which:

  -	notifications for the current group or broadcast call are sent; but

  -	no VGCS or VBS channel description for the current group or broadcast call is provided,

the mobile station shall go to idle mode and give an indication to the upper (sub-)layers.

  NOTE:	Upper (sub-)layers then can request the establishment of an RR connection in order to be informed about the channel description by the network.

If the mobile station enters a cell in which notifications for the current group or broadcast call are not sent, the mobile station shall disconnect locally the TCH, go to idle mode and give an indication to the upper (sub-)layers.

On request by the upper layer in order to respond to a paging message the RR entity shall go to the idle mode in order to establish a dedicated RR connection.

On receipt of a CHANNEL RELEASE message in UI format from the network the RR entity shall go to idle mode and give an indication to the upper layer.

If the upper layer requests to abort the group receive mode, the mobile station shall go back to idle mode.


3.4.15.1.4.2	Going to group transmit mode

Only applicable for mobile stations supporting VGCS talking.

If the upper layer requests an uplink access, the mobile station shall perform the uplink investigation procedure as defined in sub-clause 3.3.1.2.1.1 and 3.3.1.2.1.1a.

If the uplink investigation procedure is not successful, the mobile station shall give an indication to the upper layers and remain in group receive mode.

If the uplink investigation procedure is successful, the uplink access procedure as defined in sub-clause 3.3.1.2.1.2 and 3.3.1.2.1.2a or the priority uplink request procedure as defined in sub-clause 3.3.1.2.1.2b is initiated.

If the uplink access procedure or priority uplink request procedure is successful, the mobile station shall give an indication to the upper layers and enter the group transmit mode.

If the uplink access procedure or priority uplink request procedure is not successful, the mobile station shall give an indication to the upper layers and remain in group receive mode.


3.4.15.2	Network side


3.4.15.2.1	Provision of messages on the VGCS or VBS channel downlink


3.4.15.2.1.1	General

The network shall provide all messages directed to mobile stations in group receive mode (see sub-clause 3.4.15.1.2) in unacknowledged mode. Those messages which are also sent to the mobile station in group transmit mode in acknowledged mode have therefore to be repeated in addition as UI messages on the VGCS channel downlink if they shall also be received by mobile stations in group receive mode.

When the VGCS/VBS call is ciphered the BSS shall derive the ciphering keys from the following parameters, as described in 3GPP TS 43.020:

  -	Short term key as supplied at group call setup in the cell

  -	CELL_GLOBAL_COUNT

  -	Cell Global Identifier (CGI)

The ciphering key needs to be recalculated whenever CELL_GLOBAL_COUNT changes.

The ciphering algorithm is specified at resource assignment.


3.4.15.2.1.2	Provision of general information messages

In the case where the group call area exceeds one cell, the network should provide the SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 6 message on the SACCH related to the voice broadcast channel or voice group call channel.

In addition, if the group call area exceeds one cell, the network should provide SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 5 (possibly together with TYPE 5bis and 5ter) on the SACCH related to the voice broadcast channel or voice group call channel.

  -	The SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 5, TYPE 5bis and TYPE 5ter messages provide information on the BCCH frequency of the neighbour cells.

  -	The SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 6 message provides information on the location area of the current cell, possibly the status of the NCH (see conditions in sub-clause 3.3.3), and an indication of whether paging channel restructuring has taken place, and an indication of the AMR codec configuration if AMR is being used on the VGCS/VBS group channel.

  -	$(ASCI)$ The SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 10 message provides information for cell re-selection in group receive mode.

The network may also provide layer 3 messages for notification on the VGCS or VBS channel downlink FACCH.

The network may in addition provide SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 10bis messages on the SACCH of a voice group call channel to describe the location of the group call channel in neighbour cells. In such a case, if the description of the group call channel for a neighbour cell (including frequency parameters) does not fit in a SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 10bis message, the network shall send in addition a SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 10ter message for that neighbour cell.

In case the information in a SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 10bis (or TYPE 10ter) becomes invalid, the network shall immediately send a VGCS Neighbour Cell Information message on the FACCH of the group call channel. This shall indicate which parameters are now invalid for which neighbour cells, and shall include as much replacement information as possible.

A mobile station in group receive mode shall consider any information relating to a neighbour cell received in a SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 10bis (respectively TYPE 10ter) message with sequence number n or in a VGCS Neighbour Cell Information message with sequence number n as valid unless:

  -	a VGCS Neighbour Cell Information message is received which explicitly indicates that the information for that cell is invalid, or

  -	any SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 10bis or TYPE 10ter message is received with sequence number m (where m = (n + 1) mod 4 ) and a VGCS Neighbour Cell Information message has not been received which explicitly indicates that the information in the SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 10bis (respectively TYPE 10ter) message with sequence number n for that cell remains valid, or

  -	a SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 10bis (respectively TYPE 10ter) message is received containing information for that cell with sequence number m (where m > n mod 4 ), or

  -	any SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 10bis or TYPE 10ter message is received with sequence number m (where m > (n + 1) mod 4 ).


3.4.15.2.1.3	Provision of messages related to the voice group call uplink channel

Only applicable for the support of VGCS talking.

The network shall provide UPLINK FREE messages on the main signalling link of all voice group call channels when the uplink is set free. The provision of UPLINK FREE messages shall be repeated as long as no uplink is granted to a mobile station. When talker priority is supported by the network, the UPLINK FREE message shall indicate the status of the emergency mode.

The network shall provide an UPLINK BUSY message on the main signalling link of all voice group call when the uplink has been granted to a mobile station. When talker priority is supported by the network, the UPLINK BUSY message shall indicate the current talker priority and the status of the emergency mode. When validation of PRIORITY UPLINK REQUEST messages is required, the UPLINK BUSY message shall also include a token (see subclause 3.3.1.2.2b.2.4).

When the network supports uplink access option (i), as defined in 3GPP TS 43.068, and performs a handover of the talking service subscriber the network shall immediately send an updated UPLINK BUSY message:

  -	In the handover target cell when the BSS allocates the resources for a handover of the talking service subscriber to the voice group call channel in the target cell;

  -	In the handover target cell when BSS releases the resources allocated for the handover of the talking service subscriber to the voice group call channel in the target cell;

  -	In the handover source cell after reception of a HANDOVER SUCCEEDED message;

  -	In the current cell after the talking service subscriber has been switched within the cell from the group call channel to a dedicated channel or vice versa.

The network may send UPLINK FREE messages containing an uplink access request on the main signalling channel of the VGCS channels in order to obtain knowledge on whether any listening mobile is present in a cell or not. If there is no UPLINK ACCESS message, responding to the uplink access request or for the uplink access procedure, received by the network, the network may decide to clear the VGCS channel in that cell.


3.4.15.2.1.4	Provision of messages related to the voice broadcast uplink channel

The network may send UPLINK FREE messages containing an uplink access request on the main signalling channel of the VBS channels in order to obtain knowledge on whether any listening mobile is present in a cell or not. If there is no mobile station responding to the uplink access request, the network may decide to clear the VBS channel in that cell.


3.4.15.2.2	Release of the VGCS or VBS Channels

If a release request for a voice group call is received from the upper layer, the network, after having released the RR connection with the mobile station in group transmit mode, shall stop the notification procedures for that voice group call and clear all related voice group call channels.

If a release request for a voice broadcast call is received from the upper layer, the network shall stop the notification procedures for that voice broadcast call and locally disconnect any channel related to the voice broadcast call.


3.4.15.2a	VBS/VGCS reconfiguration procedure


3.4.15.2a.1	Normal behaviour

This procedure is used by the network to indicate a change in Group Channel Description, and if required, in the Cell Channel Description, at a given time for VBS and VGCS listeners in group receive mode and the VGCS talker in group transmit mode. The VBS/VGCS RECONFIGURE and VBS/VGCS RECONFIGURE2 messages are sent in unacknowledged mode (to mobile stations in group receive mode) or acknowledged mode (to mobile stations in group transmit mode) on the main DCCH of a VBS or VGCS channel.

The network sends a VBS/VGCS RECONFIGURE message containing the new group channel description together with a starting time indication. If the Cell Channel Description is to be changed then the Additional Segment field in the VBS/VGCS RECONFIGURE message shall indicate that the VBS/VGCS RECONFIGURE2 message is to follow. If the Cell Channel Description is unchanged then the Additional Segment field is set to ‘0’ and no VBS/VGCS RECONFIGURE2 message is sent. The VBS/VGCS RECONFIGURE2 message shall be sent on the main DCCH with the same starting time as indicated in the VBS/VGCS RECONFIGURE message.

Optionally, the VBS/VGCS RECONFIGURE and VBS/VGCS RECONFIGURE2 messages may be resent multiple times before starting time on the main DCCH of a VBS or VGCS channel.

On receiving the VBS/VGCS RECONFIGURE message with Additional Segment set to ‘0’ the mobile station shall wait until starting time before applying the new physical channel configuration, frequencies and/or hopping sequences to the VBS or VGCS call that the mobile station is currently listening to. If the mobile station was in group transmit mode and received the message in an I frame, it shall then, in addition, re-establish the main signalling link by sending a SABM containing a Talker Indication message (see sub-clause 3.1.5).

On receiving the VBS/VGCS RECONFIGURE message with Additional Segment set to ‘1’ the mobile station shall wait to receive the VBS/VGCS RECONFIGURE2 message with the same starting and then wait until starting time to apply the new physical channel configuration, frequencies and/or hopping sequences using the new Cell Channel Description to the VBS or VGCS call that the mobile station is currently listening to. If the mobile station was in group transmit mode and received the message in an I frame, it shall then, in addition, re-establish the main signalling link by sending a SABM containing a Talker Indication message (see sub-clause 3.1.5).

On receiving only the VBS/VGCS RECONFIGURE2 message the mobile station shall wait to receive the VBS/VGCS RECONFIGURE message with the same starting time and then wait until starting time to apply the new physical channel configuration, frequencies and/or hopping sequences using the new Cell Channel Description to the VBS or VGCS call that the mobile station is currently listening to. If the mobile station was in group transmit mode and received the message in an I frame, it shall then, in addition, re-establish the main signalling link by sending a SABM containing a Talker Indication message (see sub-clause 3.1.5).

If the Starting Time in the VBS/VGCS RECONFIGURE message indicates a time that has elapsed with Additional Segment set to ‘0’, then the mobile station shall switch to the new Group Channel Description immediately.

  NOTE:	The network implementation should take into account the possible presence of mobiles which do not recognize the VGCS/VBS RECONFIGURE or VBS/VGCS RECONFIGURE2 messages. An appropriate message (e.g. Channel Release) should be sent to indicate to such mobiles that the current group call channel is no longer in use. Such mobiles must determine the new location of the group channel by reading the NCH.


3.4.15.2a.2	Abnormal cases

 If the starting time in the VBS/VGCS RECONFIGURE has elapsed with Additional Segment set to ‘1’ and the mobile has not received the VBS/VGCS RECONFIGURE2 message, then the mobile station shall locally abort the radio connection and search all possible channel positions on the current cell and the neighbour cells for which a channel description is known for that call.

If the starting time in the VBS/VGCS RECONFIGURE2 message has elapsed and the mobile has not received the VBS/VGCS RECONFIGURE message, then the mobile station shall locally abort the radio connection and search all possible channel positions on the current cell and the neighbour cells for which a channel description is known for that call.

If the starting times in the received set of VBS/VGCS RECONFIGURE and VBS/VGCS RECONFIGURE2 messages are different then the mobile station shall ignore both of the messages.


3.4.15.3	Failure cases

If the mobile station loses the voice group call channel or voice broadcast channel, the mobile station shall search all possible channel positions on the current cell and the neighbour cells for which a channel description is known for that call.


3.4.15.3a	Additional Information procedure

In group receive mode, the network sends the talker’s details on the main DCCH in either a VGCS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION or an UPLINK BUSY message. The VGCS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION message is sent in unacknowledged mode on the main DCCH of the voice group channel. In addition the transmission of the VGCS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION message is repeated every T3153 seconds on the SACCH, until the talker is released.

The MS shall pass the information to the upper layers.


3.4.15.3b	SMS to on going group call procedure

The network may send VGCS mobile stations that are in group receive mode or group transmit mode a short message by sending it one or more RP-Data messages (see 3GPP TS 24.011). An RP-Data message is sent to the mobile stations by using one or more instances of the VGCS SMS Information message. Each VGCS SMS Information message contains an SMS reference number that identifies a particular RP-Data message. The VGCS SMS Information message is sent in unacknowledged mode on the SACCH of the group channel to the VGCS mobile stations that are in group receive mode and any VGCS talking subscriber that is using the uplink of the group channel. When the talker is on a dedicated channel the VGCS SMS Information message is sent in unacknowledged mode on the SACCH of this channel. The network may retransmit an SMS Information message for a period of up to 30s (including the initial transmission).

The network shall insert an SMS reference number in the VGCS SMS Information message to identify the particular RP-Data message. In the case that the RP-Data message has to be segmented over multiple VGCS SMS Information messages, the network shall insert a segment number in each message segment to identify the segment. The first segment shall contain a segment number of zero, with the segment number incremented by one in each subsequent segment.

The VGCS mobile station shall start an instance of T3112 for the RP-Data message when it first receives a segment of the message. The instance of timer T3112 relating to the message shall be stopped when:

  -	the MS receives the complete RP-Data message;

  -	the MS receives a VGCS SMS Information message with an SMS reference number which is more than 4 higher (modulo 16) than that of this message;

  -	the MS changes its channel;

  -	the voice group call is cleared.

If T3112 is stopped and the RP-Data message has not been completely received, the VGCS mobile station shall discard the segments of the RP-Data message.

The VGCS mobile station shall (as far as possible) pass correctly received RP-Data messages to the upper layers in order of increasing SMS reference number. The MS shall store the parameter V(G) which is the SMS reference number of the message which is to be delivered next to the upper layer. The MS initialises the value of V(G) to the value in the first received segment on the current channel.

If an RP-Data message is completely received which has an SMS reference number equal to V(G) it is passed to the upper layer, and V(G) is incremented by one (mod 16).

If an RP-Data message is completely received which has an SMS reference number which is not equal to V(G) then the MS shall start timer T3114 for that message. Timer T3114 is stopped when the message is passed to the upper layer.

On expiry of the timer T3114 for a message, each message (or any segments thereof) which has a sequence number between V(G) (inclusive) and the SMS reference number of the message for which timer T3114 expired (inclusive) shall be:

  discarded and the corresponding timer T3112 stopped, if the message has not been completely received, or

  passed to the upper layers in order, and the corresponding timer T3114 stopped, if it has been completely received.

V(G) shall then be set to the SMS reference number of the message for which timer T3114 expired plus one modulo 16.

All messages for which T3114 is running shall be passed to the upper layers, in order of increasing SMS reference number and the corresponding instances of timer T3114 stopped, if:

  -	the MS changes its channel, or

  -	the voice group call is cleared

  NOTE:	The delivery of the RP-Data message to the group call is not guaranteed. No confirmation is sent of the receipt of the RP-Data message by the VGCS mobile station.


3.4.16	Configuration change procedure

This is only applicable for multislot configuration. This message shall not be used to change a non-multislot configured channel to a multislot configured channel.

The configuration change procedure is used by the network to change the number of timeslots used in a multislot configuration. The procedure can also be used to change the channel mode of one or several channels and change their allocation. The main signalling link however, cannot be changed by the configuration change procedure. If a change of the main signalling link is needed, the assignment or handover procedures shall be used.

The network shall not initiate a new configuration change procedure before a response to the previous CONFIGURATION CHANGE COMMAND message has been received from the mobile station.


3.4.16.1	Configuration change initiation

The procedure starts when the network sends a CONFIGURATION CHANGE COMMAND to the mobile station on the main DCCH. The message indicates:

  -	which timeslots to use in uplink;

  -	which timeslots to use in downlink; and

  -	which channel set each timeslot belongs to.

The message may also contain definitions of the channel mode to be applied for one or several channel sets. If a previously undefined channel set is defined by the CONFIGURATION CHANGE COMMAND a definition of the channel mode for the new channel set shall be included in the message.


3.4.16.2	Configuration change completion

When the mobile station receives the CONFIGURATION CHANGE COMMAND it changes its configuration in accordance with the message contents and returns a CONFIGURATION CHANGE ACKNOWLEDGE on the same channel as the command message was received, confirming the new channel configuration. This applies irrespective of whether the new configuration is different from the one already in use by the mobile station or if it is the same.


3.4.16.3	Abnormal cases

If the CONFIGURATION CHANGE COMMAND message instructs the mobile station to use a Channel Configuration or Mode(s) that it does not support, or if the channel mode to use is not defined for all channel sets, the mobile station shall return a CONFIGURATION CHANGE REJECT message with cause 'channel mode unacceptable', and the mobile station shall remain on the current channel(s) and use the old Channel Configuration and Channel Mode(s).


3.4.17	Mapping of user data substreams onto timeslots in a multislot configuration

For multislot configurations the following rules for mapping of the user data substreams onto timeslots shall apply for each channel set:

  -	at initial assignment (using assignment procedure), the lowest numbered user data substream shall be mapped to the lowest numbered timeslot etc. in ascending order (the user data substreams are numbered 0 to (n-1), where n is the number of substreams);

  -	at channel changes using handover procedure or assignment procedure (where none of the timeslots are present in both the old and the new configuration), the lowest numbered user data substream shall be mapped to the lowest numbered timeslot etc. in ascending order (the user data substreams are numbered 0 to (n-1), where n is the number of substreams);

  -	at channel changes using assignment procedure (where at least one of the timeslots is the same in both the old and the new configuration) or configuration change procedure:

    -	user data substream(s) mapped to timeslot(s) that are present in both the old and the new configuration shall continue to be mapped to the same timeslot(s) as before the channel change; and

    -	possibly added timeslot(s) shall carry the lowest numbered available user data substream so that the lowest numbered data substream among the added is mapped to the lowest numbered added timeslot and so on in ascending order.

  NOTE:	The user data substream number is a number that need not be the same as the inband number used for transparent services. The user data substream number is only used as a point of reference to a specific user data substream.


3.4.18	Handling of classmark information at band change

The coding of some fields in the Mobile Station Classmark 1 and in the Mobile Station Classmark 2 information elements depends on the band in use as described in sub-clause 10.5.1.5 and sub-clause 10.5.1.6. When a command to change the frequency band (GSM 900, DCS 1800) has been received (by, e.g., an IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT message, an ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message, a HANDOVER COMMAND message, a DTM HANDOVER COMMAND message or a FREQUENCY REDEFINITION message) the following applies:

  -	When an IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT message is received, "the band used" for the purpose of coding the classmark information in the service request message, see sub-clause 3.1.5, shall be understood as the band used for the CHANNEL REQUEST message or (one of) the band(s) indicated by the IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT message.

  -	For other cases "the band used" for the purpose of coding the classmark information shall be understood as one of the bands used or attempted to be used within the 2 seconds preceding the passing of the layer 3 message containing the classmark information to the layer 2 send queue as described in 3GPP TS 44.006.

  NOTE:	This definition means that when a band change is being done the network must take appropriate actions to handle possible ambiguities in the frequency band related information in the classmark.


3.4.19	(void)


3.4.20	(void)


3.4.21	Application Procedures


3.4.21.1	General

While in dedicated mode, the following applications associated with the Radio Resource management layer may be supported in the network and MS:


3.4.21.2	Location Services (LCS)

Common procedures are defined in the Radio Resource management layer to assist these applications.


3.4.21.2A	Earthquake and Tsunami Warning System (ETWS)

Mobile station support for reception of ETWS Primary Notification message is optional.

Common procedures are defined in the Radio Resource management layer to assist this application.


3.4.21.3	Application Information Transfer

The Application Information Transfer procedure enables an Application on the network side and a peer application in the MS to exchange Application Protocol Data Units (APDUs).


3.4.21.3.1	Normal Procedure without Segmentation

The maximum size of an APPLICATION INFORMATION message is 251 octets as defined in 3GPP TS 44.006. Segmentation shall not be used when an APDU fits into a single APPLICATION INFORMATION message of maximum or smaller size.

[pic]

Figure 3.4.21.3.4.1: Application Information Transfer without segmentation

Either the network or MS may send an APPLICATION INFORMATION message once the MS is in dedicated mode. The APDU Data in the APPLICATION INFORMATION message shall contain a complete APDU according to the protocol in use. The APDU ID IE identifies the protocol and associated application. The APDU Flags IE indicates "First or Only Segment", "Last or Only Segment" and conveys a C/R flag transparently between the communicating applications. The C/R Flag may be used to distinguish a command from other messages and a final response from a non-final response. The use of the C/R flag is defined with respect to each application. If one or several APDUs are awaiting delivery to the data link layer in the MS and other layer 3 messages are ready to be sent on the uplink, the RR layer may allow these other layer 3 messages to be sent before the next pending APPLICATION INFORMATION message is delivered to the data link layer. On receiving an APPLICATION INFORMATION message, the receiving layer 3 entity shall deliver the message contents to the identified local application.


3.4.21.3.2	Normal Procedure with Segmentation

Segmentation is only included for support of interoperability with Legacy (3GPP R4 and older) equipment when a segmented message is received from a Legacy node.

Segmentation is applicable when an APDU is too large to fit into a single APPLICATION INFORMATION message. The procedure is applicable for either direction of transfer.

[pic]

Figure 3.4.21.3.2.1: Application Information Transfer with segmentation

The sending layer 3 entity shall segment an APDU by dividing it into one or more segments exactly fitting into maximum sized APPLICATION INFORMATION messages plus a final segment fitting into an APPLICATION INFORMATION message of maximum size or smaller. Once segmented, the resulting APPLICATION INFORMATION messages shall be transferred in sequence to the data link layer for transmission, without being intersperced by other level 3 messages. The first APPLICATION INFORMATION message in the sequence shall indicate "First Segment" and "Not Last Segment". Subsequent APPLICATION INFORMATION messages except for the last shall indicate "Not First Segment" and "Not Last Segment". The last APPLICATION INFORMATION message shall indicate "Not First Segment" and "Last Segment" and shall include a C/R flag as provided by the sending application.

The receiving layer 3 entity shall reassemble any segmented APDU before transfer to the local application. The receiver may employ a timer to detect possible loss of APDU segments. If employed, the timer shall be started when the first APDU segment is received and cancelled after the last segment is received.


3.4.21.3.3	Abnormal Cases

APPLICATION INFORMATION messages are sent using "low" priority at the data link layer except for the case of ETWS, see sub-clause 3.1.6. This can lead to message loss or truncation when preempted by other "high" priority messages. A receiving layer 3 entity shall detect APDU truncation if an APPLICATION INFORMATION message is received carrying an APDU or APDU segment that is shorter than indicated by the length indicator for the APDU Data IE. This test is reliable because preemption in the data link layer guarantees that at least the first 2*N201 octets of any truncated message will be reliably transferred.

An APPLICATION INFORMATION transfer error shall be detected due to any of the following:

  a)	Receipt of a truncated APDU or APDU segment;

  b)	While performing APDU reassembly:

    -	receipt of any other layer 3 message defined to use SAPI 0 on the main DCCH;

    -	receipt of an APDU or APDU segment indicating "First or Only Segment";

    -	expiration of the reassembly timer (if supported);

  c)	While not performing APDU reassembly, receipt of an APDU segment indicating "not First or only segment";

  d)	Detection of any other error for a received message as defined in clause 8.

If APDU reassembly was in process when the error occurred, the receiving layer 3 entity shall discard the partially reassembled APDU and reprocess any received APDU or APDU segment that caused the error provided not an error defined in clause 8. In all other cases, any received APDU or APDU segment shall be discarded.


3.4.22	RR procedures related to packet resource establishment while in dedicated mode

The establishment of a packet resource is supported by procedures on the main DCCH when the mobile station is in dedicated mode. The procedures are only applicable to a mobile station supporting both GPRS and DTM. The procedures are optional for the network.

These procedures constitute a complement to the corresponding procedures for temporary block flow establishment using CCCH or PCCCH while in idle mode defined in 3GPP TS 44.018 and 3GPP TS 44.060, respectively.

The packet request procedure is initiated by the MS and it is described in sub-clause 3.4.22.1. The packet notification procedure is initiated by the network and it is described in sub-clause 3.4.22.2. The packet downlink assignment is initiated by the network and it is described in sub-clause 3.4.22.3.


3.4.22.1	Packet request procedure while in dedicated mode

The packet request procedure using the main DCCH may be used to establish a packet resource to support the transfer of LLC PDUs in the direction from the mobile station to the network.


3.4.22.1.1	Entering the dual transfer mode

While in dedicated mode, the establishment of an uplink packet resource may be initiated by the RR entity of the mobile station using the packet request procedure. The procedure is triggered by a request from upper layers to transfer an LLC PDU; see 3GPP TS 24.007. The request from upper layers specifies:

  -	TLLI;

  -	radio priority;

  -	requested RLC mode associated with the packet transfer;

  -	LLC frame type;

  -	establishment cause;

  -	QoS information for the requested packet session; and

  -	optionally, the PFI.

Upon such a request, the RR entity of the mobile station:

  -	if access to the network is allowed (sub-clause 3.4.22.1.1.1), it initiates the packet request procedure as defined in sub-clause 3.4.22.1.1.2;

  -	otherwise, it rejects the request.

If the request from upper layers indicates any signalling procedure the acknowledged RLC mode shall be requested.

If both the mobile station and the BSS support multiple TBF procedures, or if the mobile station supports RLC non-persistent mode, the BSS may order its preferred RLC mode when establishing uplink packet resources, independently of the RLC mode requested by the mobile station. In particular, if the mobile station supports RLC non-persistent mode the network may allocate an EGPRS TBF that uses this RLC mode.


3.4.22.1.1.1	Permission to access the network

Access to the network is allowed if dual transfer mode is supported in the cell.

  NOTE:	belonging to an authorised access class or special class, radio priority level and LSA permission are not considered since they only apply to a mobile station in idle mode.


3.4.22.1.1.2	Initiation of establishment of the packet request procedure

The mobile station initiates the establishment of the packet resource by sending a DTM REQUEST message on the main DCCH.

The DTM REQUEST message contains:

  -	TLLI;

  -	Channel Request Description;

  -	Packet establishment cause which indicates, as applicable, a request to send user data, cell update, page response or a mobility management message;

  -	PFI, if the PFC procedures are supported by the MS and irrespective of the network support of PFC procedures;

  -	Multiple TBF Capability, irrespective of the network support of Multiple TBF procedures;

  -	RLC Non-persistent Mode Capability, irrespective of the network support of RLC Non-persistent Mode; and

  -	MS capabilities related to support of Reduced Latency or FANR, Uplink EGPRS2 and Downlink EGPRS2, irrespective of the network support of these features.

Having sent the DTM REQUEST message, the mobile station starts timer T3148.


3.4.22.1.1.3	Answer from the network


3.4.22.1.1.3.1	Packet assignment

On receipt of a DTM REQUEST message the network may allocate an uplink packet resource. The packet uplink resource is assigned to the mobile station in one of the DTM assignment messages:

  -	DTM ASSIGNMENT COMMAND; or

  -	PACKET ASSIGNMENT.

These messages are sent in acknowledged mode. The DTM ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message may be sent on the SDCCH and on the FACCH. The PACKET ASSIGNMENT message shall be sent only on FACCH. If frequency hopping is applied, the mobile station shall use the cell allocation defined for the cell to decode the mobile allocation.

The allocation of the uplink packet resource may imply the reallocation of the resource for the RR connection. In this case, the DTM ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message is used and the timer T3107 is started on the network side. The DTM ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message shall not be used to change to a dependent configuration. The DTM ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message may be used to change the ciphering mode by including the Ciphering Mode Setting IE when a mobile station supports the reception of this IE in the DTM ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message. If Ciphering Mode Setting IE is not present the ciphering mode and the use of Selective Ciphering of Downlink SACCH (see sub-clause 3.4.7a) are unchanged after the mobile station has switched to the assigned channels. If the Ciphering Mode Setting IE indicates "start ciphering" the mobile station supporting Selective Ciphering of Downlink SACCH shall be able to decode both ciphered and not-ciphered SACCH blocks (see sub-clause 3.4.7a). The DTM ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message shall not contain a Cipher Mode Setting IE that indicates "start ciphering" unless a CIPHERING MODE COMMAND message has been transmitted earlier in the RR connection or ciphering has been started earlier in UTRAN. If such a DTM ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message is received it shall be regarded as erroneous, a DTM ASSIGNMENT FAILURE with cause "Protocol error unspecified" message shall be returned immediately, and no further action taken.

When sending the DTM ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message on the network side, and when receiving it on the mobile station side, all transmission of signalling layer messages except for those RR messages needed for this procedure and for abnormal cases is suspended until resumption is indicated. These RR messages can be deduced from sub-clauses 3.4.22.1 and 8.8 Radio Resource management.

The PACKET ASSIGNMENT message is only used when the packet resource is a PDCH and no reallocation of the RR connection is needed.

On receipt of:

  -	DTM ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message; or

  -	PACKET ASSIGNMENT message;

the mobile station shall stop T3148.

If the received DTM ASSIGNMENT COMMAND or PACKET ASSIGNMENT message includes uplink packet resources, the mobile station shall proceed with the packet access. If, in addition, the received DTM ASSIGNMENT COMMAND or PACKET ASSIGNMENT message includes concurrent downlink packet resources, the mobile station shall also obey the packet downlink assignment. If the received message includes downlink packet resources and no uplink packet resources, the mobile station shall abort the packet access procedure and proceed with the procedure specified in sub-clause 3.4.22.3, and then attempt an establishment of uplink TBF, using the applicable procedure specified in 3GPP TS 44.060.

If the network supports multiple TBF procedures, it shall indicate this support in the Multiple TBF Capability field in the GPRS Cell Options IE included in the DTM Assignment Command and the Packet Assignment messages.

Upon receipt of the DTM ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message, the mobile station initiates a local end release of link layer connections, disconnects the physical channels, commands the switching to the assigned channel and initiates the establishment of lower layer connection (this includes the activation of the channel, their connection and the establishment of the main signalling link).

If the channel mode to be applied corresponds to an initial assignment of a multi-rate speech codec, the DTM ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message shall contain the MultiRate Configuration IE, which defines the set of codec modes and related information to use on the new channel.

If the assignment is related to an assignment from a multi-rate speech codec to a multi-rate speech codec, the MultiRate Configuration IE shall be included in the DTM ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message in the case of full rate to half rate change. If not included in this case, the mobile station shall behave as if the MultiRate Configuration IE was inconsistent. If not included in other cases, the MS shall use on the new channel the AMR configuration it was using on the old channel when it received the DTM ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message.


3.4.22.1.1.3.2	RR reallocation only

If the mobile station receives an ASSIGNMENT COMMAND or HANDOVER COMMAND message during the packet access procedure, the mobile station shall abort the packet access procedure, stop timer T3148 and proceed with the channel assignment procedure as specified in sub-clause 3.4.3 or the handover procedure as specified in sub-clause 3.4.4. The mobile station shall then attempt an establishment of uplink TBF, using the procedure specified in sub-clause 3.4.22.

If the mobile station receives a CHANNEL RELEASE message during the packet access procedure, the mobile station shall abort the packet access procedure, stop timer T3148 and proceed with the RR connection release procedure as specified in sub-clause 3.4.13. The mobile station shall then attempt an establishment of uplink TBF.

If the mobile station receives an INTER SYSTEM TO UTRAN HANDOVER COMMAND message during the packet access procedure, the mobile station shall abort the packet access procedure, stop timer T3148 and proceed with the handover to UTRAN procedure as specified in sub-clause 3.4.4a. If a mobile station which is not UTRAN capable receives this message, the error handling as defined in sub-clause 8.4 applies.


3.4.22.1.1.3.3	Packet request rejection

If the network cannot allocate the requested packet resource it may send the mobile station a DTM REJECT message in acknowledged mode on the main DCCH. This message contains a wait time ("wait indication" information element).

On receipt of the DTM REJECT message, the mobile station stops T3148, notifies upper layers of a packet resource establishment failure and starts timer T3142 with the indicated value.

The mobile station is not allowed to make a new attempt for packet access in the same cell until T3142 expires. The value of the wait indication (i.e. T3142) relates to the cell from which it was received.


3.4.22.1.1.4	Packet request completion

The completion of the packet request procedure depends on the actual assignment message used by the network.

  -	When the network sends a DTM ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message (i.e. reallocation of the CS resource is required), after the main signalling link is successfully established, the mobile station returns an ASSIGNMENT COMPLETE message, specifying cause "normal event", to the network on the main DCCH. The packet request procedure is completed for the mobile station when the ASSIGNMENT COMPLETE message is sent and for the network when it is received. The network then stops timer T3107. The sending of the ASSIGNMENT COMPLETE message on the mobile station side and its receipt on the network side allow the resumption of the transmission of signalling layer messages other than those belonging to RR management.

  -	When the network sends a PACKET ASSIGNMENT message, the packet request procedure is completed for the network when assignment message is sent and for the mobile station when it is received.

When the packet request procedure is completed, the mobile station has entered the dual transfer mode.


3.4.22.1.1.5	Abnormal cases

In the following cases, a resource establishment failure has occurred:

  a)	If a DTM ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message indicates resources in a non-supported frequency band.

  b)	If the information available in the mobile station after the reception of a DTM ASSIGNMENT COMMAND or PACKET ASSIGNMENT message does not satisfactorily define uplink packet resources or concurrent uplink and downlink packet resources if both were included in the message.

  c)	If a DTM ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message includes a mobile allocation or a frequency list that indexes frequencies in more than one frequency band.

  d)	If a DTM ASSIGNMENT COMMAND or PACKET ASSIGNMENT message assigns resources not compliant with the multislot capabilities of the mobile station.

  e)	If the mobile station has no current Cell Allocation (Cell Channel Description) and if it needs a Cell Allocation to analyse the DTM ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message or the PACKET ASSIGNMENT message.

  f)	If the DTM ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message instructs the mobile station to use a channel description or mode that it does not support.

  g)	If the DTM ASSIGNMENT COMMAND or PACKET ASSIGNMENT message does not include any uplink or downlink packet resources.

  h)	At expiry of timer T3148.

  i)	If the DTM ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message includes a Channel Mode IE indicating multi-rate speech codec but the Multi-Rate configuration IE is missing and no old multi-rate configuration exists.

  j)	If the DTM ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message includes a Channel Mode IE indicating multi-rate speech codec and the possibly included Multi-Rate configuration IE is inconsistent.

    	The MultiRate Configuration IE shall be considered as inconsistent by the mobile station if:

    -	the active set does not include any codec mode or the active set includes more than four codec modes; or

    -	one or more codec modes of the active codec set are not supported by the assigned channel; or

    -	the threshold and hysteresis values are not set according to requirements given in 3GPP TS 45.009.

  k)	If a PACKET ASSIGNMENT message is received on SDCCH.

  l)	If the DTM ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message or PACKET ASSIGNMENT message includes the description of a SDCCH channel.

  m)	If the DTM ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message includes a mode of ciphering not supported by the mobile station.

In any of these cases, the mobile station shall remain in dedicated mode. In addition, if the mobile station has received a DTM ASSIGNMENT COMMAND, it shall return a DTM ASSIGNMENT FAILURE message on the main DCCH with one of the following corresponding cause values:

  -	In case of abnormal cases a), c) above, "frequency not implemented";

  -	In case of abnormal cases b), d), g), l), m) above, "protocol error unspecified";

  -	In case of abnormal case e) above, "no cell allocation available";

  -	In case of abnormal cases f), i), j) above, "channel mode unacceptable".

Upper layers shall also be notified (resource establishment failure).

In addition:

  -	If the network commands the mobile station to reallocate the RR connection and the establishment of the main DCCH fails, all the allocated packet resources described in the new configuration are released; the mobile station shall revert to the old channel in dedicated mode, trigger the establishment of the main DCCH and send a DTM ASSIGNMENT FAILURE message on the main DCCH with cause value "lower layer failure".

  -	If a lower layer failure happens while attempting to connect back to the old channel, the radio link failure procedure is applied (see sub-clause 3.4.13.2).

When receiving the DTM ASSIGNMENT FAILURE message, the network stops T3107.

On the network side, if timer T3107 elapses before either the ASSIGNMENT COMPLETE message has been received on the new channel or a DTM ASSIGNMENT FAILURE message is received on the old channel; the old channel and the new channel are released. On the network side, lower layer failures occurring on the old channel after the sending of the DTM ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message are ignored. Lower layer failures occurring after the receipt of the SABM frame on the new main DCCH are treated following the general rules (cf. sub-clause 3.5.2).


3.4.22.2	Packet notification procedure in dedicated mode

The packet notification procedure is initiated by the RR entity of the network side. It is triggered by a page request from the GMM sublayer, see 3GPP TS 24.007.


3.4.22.2.1	Packet notification initiation by the network

The network initiates the packet notification procedure by sending the mobile station a PACKET NOTIFICATION message on the main DCCH.

The network shall not send the PACKET NOTIFICATION message to a mobile station that does not support dual transfer mode operation. If a mobile station not supporting dual transfer mode receives this message, the error handling as defined in sub-clause 8.4 applies.


3.4.22.2.2	Packet notification response

Upon receipt of the PACKET NOTIFICATION message, the RR sublayer of the mobile station indicates the receipt of a packet paging request to the GMM sublayer; see 3GPP TS 24.007.


3.4.22.3	Packet downlink assignment in dedicated mode

The packet downlink assignment procedure in dedicated mode may be used to establish a packet resource to support the transfer of LLC PDUs in the direction from the network to the mobile station.

This procedure is only applicable to a mobile station in dedicated mode and with no TBF allocated. If the mobile station already has an ongoing TBF, the establishment of the downlink packet resource is performed on the PACCH; see 3GPP TS 44.060.

The establishment of a downlink packet resource is initiated by the RR entity on the network side using the packet downlink assignment procedure in dedicated mode. The procedure is triggered by a request from upper layers to transfer an LLC PDU; see 3GPP TS 24.007. The request from upper layers specifies a QoS profile, an RLC mode, DRX parameters and an MS classmark associated with the packet transfer. The BSS may order its preferred RLC mode independently of the RLC mode signalled from upper layers. If the mobile station supports RLC non-persistent mode the network may allocate an EGPRS TBF that uses this RLC mode.


3.4.22.3.1	Initiation of the packet downlink assignment procedure in dedicated mode

The network initiates the packet downlink assignment procedure in dedicated mode by sending a DTM assignment message (i.e. DTM ASSIGNMENT COMMAND or a PACKET ASSIGNMENT) in acknowledged mode. The DTM ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message may be sent on the SDCCH and on the FACCH. The PACKET ASSIGNMENT message shall be sent only on FACCH.

When sending the DTM ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message on the network side, and when receiving it on the mobile station side, all transmission of signalling layer messages except for those RR messages needed for this procedure and for abnormal cases is suspended until resumption is indicated. These RR messages can be deduced from sub-clauses 3.4.22.3 and 8.8 Radio Resource management.

The allocation of the downlink packet resource may imply the reallocation of the resource for the RR connection. In this case, the DTM ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message is used and the timer T3107 is started on the network side. The DTM ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message shall not be used to change to a dependent configuration. The DTM ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message may be used to change the ciphering mode by including the Ciphering Mode Setting IE when a mobile station supports the reception of this IE in the DTM ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message. The DTM ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message shall not contain a Cipher Mode Setting IE that indicates "start ciphering" unless a CIPHERING MODE COMMAND message has been transmitted earlier in the RR connection or ciphering has been started earlier in UTRAN. If such a DTM ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message is received it shall be regarded as erroneous, a DTM ASSIGNMENT FAILURE with cause "Protocol error unspecified" message shall be returned immediately, and no further action taken.

The network shall not send any of the DTM assignment messages to a mobile station that does not support dual transfer mode operation. If a mobile station not supporting dual transfer mode receives any of these messages, the error handling as defined in sub-clause 8.4 applies.

Upon receipt of the DTM ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message, the mobile station initiates a local end release of link layer connections, disconnects the physical channels, commands the switching to the assigned channel and initiates the establishment of lower layer connection (this includes the activation of the channel, their connection and the establishment of the main signalling link).

If the channel mode to be applied corresponds to an initial assignment of a multi-rate speech codec, the DTM ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message shall contain the MultiRate Configuration IE, which defines the set of codec modes and related information to use on the new channel.

If the assignment is related to an assignment from a multi-rate speech codec to a multi-rate speech codec, the MultiRate Configuration IE shall be included in the DTM ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message in the case of full rate to half rate change. If not included in this case, the mobile station shall behave as if the MultiRate Configuration IE was inconsistent. If not included in other cases, the MS shall use on the new channel the AMR configuration it was using on the old channel when it received the DTM ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message.


3.4.22.3.2	Packet downlink assignment completion

The completion of the packet downlink assignment procedure while in dedicated mode depends on the actual assignment message used by the network:

  -	when the network sends a DTM ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message (i.e. reallocation of the RR connection is required), after the main signalling link is successfully established, the mobile station returns an ASSIGNMENT COMPLETE message, specifying cause "normal event", to the network on the main DCCH. The packet downlink assignment procedure is completed for the mobile station when the ASSIGNMENT COMPLETE message is sent and for the network when it is received. The network then stops timer T3107. The sending of the ASSIGNMENT COMPLETE message on the mobile station side and its receipt on the network side allow the resumption of the transmission of signalling layer messages other than those belonging to RR management.

  -	when the network sends a PACKET ASSIGNMENT message, the packet downlink assignment procedure is completed for the network when assignment message is sent and for the mobile station when it is received.


3.4.22.3.3	Abnormal cases

In the following cases, a resource establishment failure has occurred:

  a)	If a DTM ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message indicates packet resources in a non-supported frequency band.

  b)	If the information available in the mobile station after the reception of a DTM ASSIGNMENT COMMAND or PACKET ASSIGNMENT message does not satisfactorily define downlink packet resources.

  c)	If a DTM ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message includes a mobile allocation or a frequency list that indexes frequencies in more than one frequency band.

  d)	If a DTM ASSIGNMENT COMMAND or PACKET ASSIGNMENT message assigns resources not compliant with the multislot capabilities of the mobile station.

  e)	If the mobile station has no current CA and if it needs a CA to analyse the DTM ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message.

  f)	If the DTM ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message instructs the mobile station to use a channel description or mode that it does not support.

  g)	If the DTM ASSIGNMENT COMMAND or PACKET ASSIGNMENT message does not include any downlink packet resources, or if it includes uplink packet resources.

  h)	If the DTM ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message includes a Channel Mode IE indicating multi-rate speech codec but the Multi-Rate configuration IE is missing and no old multi-rate configuration exists.

  i)	If the DTM ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message includes a Channel Mode IE indicating multi-rate speech codec and the possibly included Multi-Rate configuration IE is inconsistent.

    	The MultiRate Configuration IE shall be considered as inconsistent by the mobile station if:

    -	the active set does not include any codec mode or the active set includes more than four codec modes; or

    -	one or more codec modes of the active codec set are not supported by the assigned channel; or

    -	the threshold and hysteresis values are not set according to requirements given in 3GPP TS 45.009.

  j )	If a PACKET ASSIGNMENT message is received on SDCCH.

  k)	If the DTM ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message or PACKET ASSIGNMENT message includes the description of a SDCCH channel.

  l)	If the DTM ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message includes a mode of ciphering not supported by the mobile station.

In any of these cases, the mobile station shall remain in dedicated mode.

If the mobile station has received a DTM ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message, it shall return a DTM ASSIGNMENT FAILURE message on the main DCCH with one of the following corresponding cause values:

  -	In case of abnormal cases a), c) above, "frequency not implemented";

  -	In case of abnormal cases b), d), g), k), l) above, "protocol error unspecified";

  -	In case of abnormal case e) above, "no cell allocation available";

  -	In case of abnormal case f), h), i) above, "channel mode unacceptable".

In addition:

  -	If the network commands the mobile station to reallocate the RR connection and the establishment of the main DCCH fails, all the allocated packet resources described in the new configuration are released; the mobile station shall revert to the old channel in dedicated mode, trigger the establishment of the main DCCH and send a DTM ASSIGNMENT FAILURE message on the old main DCCH with cause value "lower layer failure".

  -	If a lower layer failure happens while attempting to connect back to the old channel, the radio link failure procedure is applied (see sub-clause 3.4.13.2).

When receiving the DTM ASSIGNMENT FAILURE message, the network stops T3107.

On the network side, if timer T3107 elapses before either the ASSIGNMENT COMPLETE message has been received on the new channel or a DTM ASSIGNMENT FAILURE message is received on the old channel; the old channel and the new channel are released.

On the network side, lower layer failures occurring on the old channel after the sending of the DTM ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message are ignored. Lower layer failures occurring after the receipt of the SABM frame on the new main DCCH are treated following the general rules (cf. sub-clause 3.5.2).


3.4.22.4	Modification of packet resources while in DTM

When the mobile station is in dual transfer mode, the network or mobile station may wish to modify only the allocated packet resources. When the mobile station has one or more ongoing TBFs, the procedures described in 3GPP TS 44.060 shall be used.


3.4.23	RR procedures related to packet resource maintenance while in dual transfer mode


3.4.23.1	General

Once the mobile station enters the dual transfer mode, the existent procedures apply (see 3GPP TS 44.060). Some exceptions to the existent procedures while in dual transfer mode are:

  -	When all packet resources have been released (or aborted), the mobile station returns to dedicated mode.

  -	When the mobile station is in dual transfer mode, it shall ignore any PACKET CELL CHANGE ORDER or PACKET ASSIGNMENT messages and shall remain in dual transfer mode.

  -	When the mobile station receives a HANDOVER COMMAND, HANDOVER TO UTRAN COMMAND, HANDOVER TO CDMA2000 COMMAND, HANDOVER TO IU MODE COMMAND or ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message, it shall abandon the packet resource immediately, enter dedicated mode and perform the handover or assignment procedure, respectively.

  -	When the mobile station receives a DTM ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message whilst in dual transfer mode, it shall follow procedures specified in sub-clause 3.4.23.2.

  -	As stated in 3GPP TS 45.008, no GPRS measurement reporting is performed.

In case the network has to change the frequency parameters and needs to specify a start time for the RR connection, the frequency redefinition procedure shall be used (see sub-clause 3.4.5) If the RR connection can be started immediately after resource reallocation with change of frequency parameters, the DTM ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message or the frequency redefinition procedure shall be used.

In case the network has to change the channel mode of the traffic channel, the channel mode modify procedure shall be used (see sub-clause 3.4.6).

The mobile station remains in dual transfer mode until the RR connection or all the packet resources are released.

When the mobile station receives a DTM ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message encapsulated in a PACKET CS COMMAND message, it shall follow procedures specified in sub-clause 3.4.23.2.2 and 3.4.23.2.3 with the exceptions described in 3GPP TS 44.060.


3.4.23.2	RR and packet resource reallocation whilst in dual transfer mode


3.4.23.2.1	General

In dual transfer mode an intracell change of channel can be requested by upper layers for changing the channel type, or decided by the RR sublayer, e.g. for an internal handover or for the reallocation of all the resources of the mobile station. The purpose is to modify completely the physical channel configuration of the mobile station without change in synchronization while staying in the same cell.

The mobile station and the network shall change neither the RLC mode nor TBF mode of an already established TBF during resource reallocation. The change of RLC mode or TBF mode shall be achieved through release of the TBF and establishment of a new TBF with the new RLC mode or TBF mode.

The usage of the DTM ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message depends on whether the mobile station supports multiple TBF procedures, DTM enhancements or Downlink Dual Carrier:

  -	If the mobile station does not support any of multiple TBF procedures, DTM enhancements or Downlink Dual Carrier, the DTM ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message is used by the network to reallocate the DTM resources assigned to a mobile station when the CS channel needs to be reallocated. All of the ongoing TBFs shall be addressed by the DTM ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message. The procedures in 3GPP TS  44.060 shall be used to establish an additional TBF or to release an ongoing TBF.

  -	If the mobile station supports multiple TBF procedures, DTM enhancements or Downlink Dual Carrier, the DTM ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message may be used by the network, when the CS channel needs to be reallocated, in order to reallocate the DTM resources assigned to a mobile station, to assign new uplink and downlink TBFs and to implicitly release TBFs.

This procedure includes:

  -	the suspension of normal operation except for RR management (layer 3);

  -	the release of the main signalling link and of the other data links as defined in sub-clause 3.1.4;

  -	the disconnection of TCHs and PDTCHs;

  -	the deactivation of previously assigned channels (layer 1);

  -	the activation of the new channels and their connection if applicable;

  -	the triggering of the establishment of the data link connections for SAPI = 0.


3.4.23.2.2	Normal resource reallocation case

The reallocation of resources assigned to a mobile station is initiated by the network using a DTM ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message. Once the DTM ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message has been transmitted the timer T3107 is started on the network side. The DTM ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message may be used to change the ciphering mode by including the Ciphering Mode Setting IE when a mobile station supports the reception of this IE in the DTM ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message. The DTM ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message shall not contain a Cipher Mode Setting IE that indicates "start ciphering" unless a CIPHERING MODE COMMAND message has been transmitted earlier in the RR connection or ciphering has been started earlier in UTRAN. If such a DTM ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message is received it shall be regarded as erroneous, a DTM ASSIGNMENT FAILURE with cause "Protocol error unspecified" message shall be returned immediately, and no further action taken.

Upon receipt of the DTM ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message, the mobile station initiates a local end release of link layer connections, disconnects the physical channels, commands the switching to the assigned channel and initiates the establishment of lower layer connection (this includes the activation of the channel, their connection and the establishment of the main signalling link).

Upon receipt of the DTM ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message, the mobile station shall then switch to the assigned PDCHs and follow the applicable procedures specified in 3GPP TS 44.060. Neither the TLLI (in A/Gb mode) nor the G-RNTI (in Iu mode) shall be included in any of the uplink RLC data blocks in that case. If the mobile station supports multiple TBF procedures or DTM enhancements and the network addresses only a subset of the ongoing TBFs, the mobile station shall consider all ongoing TBFs not addressed by the DTM ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message as released. If while waiting for the frame number indicated by the TBF starting time the mobile station receives the DTM ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message, the mobile station shall act upon the most recently received uplink or downlink assignment and shall ignore the previous uplink or downlink assignment.

After the main signalling link is successfully established, the mobile station returns an ASSIGNMENT COMPLETE message, specifying cause "normal event", to the network on the main DCCH. The reallocation of resources is completed for the mobile station when the ASSIGNMENT COMPLETE message is sent and for the network when it is received. The network then stops timer T3107. The sending of the ASSIGNMENT COMPLETE message on the mobile station side and its receipt on the network side allow the resumption of the transmission of signalling layer messages other than those belonging to RR management.

If the mobile station has requested one or more new uplink TBFs (as specified in 3GPP TS 44.060) and a DTM ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message is received from the network before resources are allocated for the requested uplink TBFs, the mobile station shall:

  -	follow the reallocation procedure as specified in this sub-clause;

  -	if the mobile station supports multiple TBF procedures or DTM enhancements it shall stop the instance of the RLC timer T3168 associated with the uplink TBF receiving a resource allocation (as specified in 3GPP TS 44.060);

  -	wait for the network response to the outstanding uplink TBF requests on the newly allocated resources.


3.4.23.2.3	Abnormal cases

In the following cases, a resource re-allocation failure has occurred :

  a)	If a DTM ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message indicates resources in a non-supported frequency band.

  b)	If the information available in the mobile station after the reception of a DTM ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message does not satisfactorily define uplink packet resources if uplink packet resources were established or downlink packet resources if downlink packet resources were established.

  c)	If a DTM ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message includes a mobile allocation or a frequency list that indexes frequencies in more than one frequency band.

  d)	If a DTM ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message assigns resources not compliant with the multislot capabilities of the mobile station.

  e)	If the mobile station has no current CA and if it needs a CA to analyse the DTM ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message.

  f)	If the DTM ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message instructs the mobile station to use a channel description or mode that it does not support.

  g)	If the DTM ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message does not include any uplink or downlink packet resources, except if encapsulated in a PACKET CS COMMAND message (as specified in 3GPP TS 44.060).

  h)	If the DTM ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message includes a Channel Mode IE indicating multi-rate speech codec but the Multi-Rate configuration IE is missing and no old multi-rate configuration exists.

  i)	If the DTM ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message includes a Channel Mode IE indicating multi-rate speech codec and the possibly included Multi-Rate configuration IE is inconsistent.

    	The MultiRate Configuration IE shall be considered as inconsistent by the mobile station if:

    -	the active set does not include any codec mode or the active set includes more than four codec modes; or

    -	one or more codec modes of the active codec set are not supported by the assigned channel; or

    -	the threshold and hysteresis values are not set according to requirements given in 3GPP TS 45.009.

  j)	If the DTM assignment command message, sent to a mobile station that does not support any of multiple TBF procedures, DTM enhancements or Downlink Dual Carrier, addresses more or fewer TBFs than the MS currently has been allocated.

    If the DTM assignment command message, sent to a mobile station that supports multiple TBF procedures, DTM enhancements or Downlink Dual Carrier, contains uplink assignments (including PFI values) for which no TBF was requested.

  k)	If the DTM ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message includes the description of a SDCCH channel.

  l)	If the DTM ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message includes a mode of ciphering not supported by the mobile station.

In any of these cases, the mobile station shall remain in DTM mode on the old configuration and return a DTM ASSIGNMENT FAILURE message on the current main DCCH with one of the following corresponding cause values:

  -	In case of abnormal cases a), c) above, "frequency not implemented";

  -	In case of abnormal cases b), d), g), k), j), l) above, "protocol error unspecified";

  -	In case of abnormal case e) above, "no cell allocation available";

  -	In case of abnormal cases f), h), i) above, "channel mode unacceptable".

In addition:

  -	If the establishment of the new main DCCH fails, all the allocated packet resources described in the new configuration in the DTM ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message are released; the mobile station shall revert to the old channel in dedicated mode, trigger the establishment of the main DCCH and send a DTM ASSIGNMENT FAILURE message on the main DCCH with cause value "lower layer failure" ; if an uplink TBF was active when the mobile station received the DTM ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message, the mobile station shall initiate the establishment of a new uplink TBF using the appropriate DTM procedure on the main DCCH, defined in sub-clause 3.4.22.1.

  -	If a lower layer failure happens on the circuit switched resource while attempting to connect back to the old channel, the radio link failure procedure is applied (see sub-clause 3.4.13.2).

  -	If a lower layer failure happens on re-allocated packet resources (such as T3180 or T3190 expiry ; see 3GPP TS 44.060) before the ASSIGNMENT COMPLETE message has been sent, all packet resources are released ; the mobile station shall revert to dedicated mode on the new channel ; if an uplink TBF was active when the mobile station received the DTM ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message, the mobile station shall initiate the establishment of a new uplink TBF using the appropriate DTM procedure on the main DCCH, defined in sub-clause 3.4.22.1 once the new main DCCH has been successfully established.

When receiving the DTM ASSIGNMENT FAILURE message, the network stops T3107.

On the network side, if timer T3107 elapses before either the ASSIGNMENT COMPLETE message has been received on the new channel or a DTM ASSIGNMENT FAILURE message is received on the old channel; the old channel and the new channel are released.

On the network side, lower layer failures occurring on the old channel after the sending of the DTM ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message are ignored. Lower layer failures occurring after the receipt of the SABM frame on the new main DCCH are treated following the general rules (cf. sub-clause 3.5.2).


3.4.24	RR procedures related to packet resource release while in dual transfer mode

The release of a TBF shall follow the procedures in 3GPP TS 44.060.

In the case of the release of the RR connection while in dual transfer mode, the mobile station may abandon the packet resources and, once in idle mode and packet idle mode, it may start a new establishment as described in 3GPP TS 44.060, or, if redirected to UTRAN according to the information element "Cell selection indicator after release of all TCH and SDCCH", as described in 3GPP TS 25.331, or, if redirected to E-UTRAN according to the information element "Cell selection indicator after release of all TCH and SDCCH", as described in 3GPP TS 36.331.

If the network redirects a mobile station towards E-UTRAN, it proceeds as follows:

  -	The network shall use the information element "Cell selection indicator after release of all TCH and SDCCH" in the channel release message for redirection towards an EARFCN in the E-UTRAN band numbered less than 65.

  -	The network shall use the information element "individual priorities" in the channel release message for redirection towards an EARFCN in the E-UTRAN band numbered greater than 64.

If the mobile station and the network support the enhanced DTM CS release procedure, the network may delay the release of the RR connection until the mobile station has received the needed system information, in order to maintain the radio resources on the PDCH(s)after the release of the RR connection.


3.4.25	GPRS suspension procedure


3.4.25.1	General

This procedure enables the network to suspend GPRS services packet flow in the downlink direction. The support of this procedure is conditional to the support of GPRS by the mobile station.

When a mobile station which is IMSI attached for GPRS services (see 3GPP TS 24.008) enters the dedicated mode, and when the mobile station limitations make it unable to handle both dedicated mode and either packet idle mode or packet transfer mode simultaneously, the mobile station shall perform the GPRS suspension procedure.

The RR sublayer of the mobile station shall indicate a RR GPRS suspend condition to the MM sublayer, see 3GPP TS 24.008.


3.4.25.2	MS in class B mode of operation

The GPRS suspension procedure shall be used to suspend GPRS services when the mobile station is in class B mode of operation and a circuit switched service is initiated. It is also used when a mobile station in CS/PS mode of operation in UTRAN reverts to class B mode of operation in GSM.

The GPRS suspension procedure is initiated by the mobile station by sending a GPRS SUSPENSION REQUEST message with the appropriate suspension cause. This can be done as early as possible after access but shall be done after sending a CLASSMARK CHANGE message.


3.4.25.3	Dual transfer mode not supported

The GPRS suspension procedure shall be used to suspend GPRS services:

  a)	when the mobile station in a class A mode of operation is handed over to a cell where the support of Class A mode of operation is not possible (e.g. a DTM mobile station entering a cell not supporting DTM);

  b)	when the GPRS attached mobile station is in a cell that does not support DTM and a circuit switched service is initiated.

In case a), when the mobile station concludes that DTM is not supported in the new cell after the handover procedure is completed, it shall initiate the GPRS suspension procedure by sending a GPRS SUSPENSION REQUEST message with the suspension cause set to "DTM not supported in the cell".

In case b), the GPRS suspension procedure is initiated by the mobile station by sending a GPRS SUSPENSION REQUEST message with the suspension cause set to "DTM not supported in the cell". This can be done as early as possible after access but shall be done after sending a CLASSMARK CHANGE message.


3.4.26	GPRS Transparent Transport Procedure

While in dedicated mode, upper layers in the mobile station or in the network may request the transport of GPRS information transparently over the radio interface when DTM operation is supported by both the mobile station and the network. This procedure is only applicable when

  -	the information from upper layers is signalling information; and

  -	the GTTP length of the message is below the maximum indicated by the network.

On the mobile station side signalling is any LLC PDU carried on LLC SAPI 1. In any other case, the RR procedures related to packet resource establishment while in dedicated mode apply.

The information from upper layers shall be carried inside the GTTP Information message. The GTTP Information message contains:

  -	the TLLI of the MS; and

  -	the LLC PDU.

If the mobile station supporting network sharing has received the PLMN Index (see sub-clause 3.4.4.1) in the HANDOVER COMMAND or DTM HANDOVER COMMAND message, it shall include it in the GTTP information message in the Skip Indicator (see sub-clause 10.3.1) if a foreign or random TLLI is used.

If the indicated TLLI is not assigned to the mobile station, the mobile station shall ignore the received message.

The GTTP messages are sent using "normal" priority at the data link layer.


3.4.27	RR procedures related to dedicated mode MBMS notification


3.4.27.1	General

The MBMS announcement of an mobile station is supported by procedures on the main DCCH when the mobile station is in dedicated mode. The procedures are only applicable to a mobile station supporting MBMS. The procedures are optional for the network.

The packet request procedure is initiated by the MS and it is described in sub-clause 3.4.22.1. The packet notification procedure is initiated by the network and it is described in sub-clause 3.4.22.2. The packet downlink assignment is initiated by the network and it is described in sub-clause 3.4.22.3.


3.4.27.2	MBMS announcement procedure in dedicated mode


3.4.27.2.1	General

The MBMS announcement procedure is initiated by the RR entity of the network side. It is triggered by the network being informed of a starting MBMS session or of an ongoing MBMS broadcast session with an updated MBMS service area list, see 3GPP TS 48.018.


3.4.27.2.2	MBMS announcement initiation by the network

The network initiates the MBMS announcement procedure by sending the mobile station a MBMS ANNOUNCEMENT message on the main DCCH.

The network shall not send the MBMS ANNOUNCEMENT message to a mobile station that does not support the MBMS service or to a mobile station that has not completed the Service Information Sending procedure. If a mobile station not supporting MBMS receives this message, the error handling as defined in sub-clause 8.4 applies.


3.4.27.2.3	MBMS notification response

Upon receipt of the MBMS ANNOUNCEMENT message including the identity of an MBMS service to which the MBMS capable mobile station has not joined, the RR sublayer of the mobile station shall discard the MBMS ANNOUNCEMENT message.

Upon receipt of the MBMS ANNOUNCEMENT message including the identity of an MBMS service to which the MBMS capable mobile station has joined and indicating a session that the mobile has not received, the RR sublayer of the mobile station indicates the receipt of a message, and passes the MBMS specific information contained within the MBMS ANNOUNCEMENT message, to the GMM sublayer.

If the Restriction Timer IE is included in the received MBMS ANNOUNCEMENT message, the mobile station shall set and start an instance of T3222 to the value indicated in the Restriction Timer IE, otherwise if the Estimated Session Duration is included in the received MBMS ANNOUNCEMENT message the mobile station shall set and start both an instance of T3222 and the session duration timer for this MBMS session with a value equal to the Estimated Session Duration. The mobile station shall store the MBMS specific information contained in the MBMS ANNOUNCEMENT message. If T3222 expires the mobile station shall discard the stored MBMS information associated with this instance of T3222.

If the mobile station in dedicated mode successfully completes the handover procedure, any MPRACH description or MBMS p-t-m channel description and MBMS Session Parameters List stored from a previously received MBMS ANNOUNCEMENT message shall be deleted.

If the mobile station enters packet idle mode before the expiry of T3222 or where no instance of T3222 was set and the MBMS ANNOUNCEMENT message did not include the MBMS p-t-m channel description, the mobile station shall stop T3222, if started, and shall follow the MBMS Packet Access Procedure (3GPP TS 44.060).

If the mobile station enters packet idle mode before the expiry of T3222 and the MBMS ANNOUNCEMENT message included the MBMS p-t-m channel description, the mobile station shall stop T3222 and shall start listening to downlink RLC blocks identified by the assigned TFI on the defined PDCHs either at the point in time denoted by the MBMS Radio Bearer Starting Time, if present and not already elapsed, or immediately otherwise (3GPP TS 44.060).

  NOTE:	If the MBMS ANNOUNCEMENT message includes the MBMS p-t-m channel description, it shall also include the MBMS Session Parameters List (and vice versa).


3.4.28	Transmission of application-specific data by the talker


3.4.28.1	General

This procedure is applicable only for the talker.

The transmission of application-specific data by the talker is carried out by the mobile transmitting a DATA INDICATION message on the main signalling link.


3.5	RR procedures on CCCH and EC-CCCH related to temporary block flow establishment


3.5.0	General

The establishment of a temporary block flow (TBF) on a packet data physical channel is supported by procedures on CCCH when PCCCH is not provided in the cell or on EC-CCCH when the cell supports EC-GSM-IoT and the mobile station has enabled EC operation. The procedures for temporary block flow establishment using CCCH are only applicable to a mobile station supporting GPRS. The procedures are optional for the network.

These procedures constitute a complement to the corresponding procedures for temporary block flow establishment using PCCCH, defined in 3GPP TS 44.060, and include the procedures using:

  -	CCCH for packet paging for mobile stations that have not enabled EC operation (sub-clause 3.5.1),

  -	EC-CCCH for packet paging for mobile stations that have enabled EC operation (sub-clause 3.5.1a),

  -	CCCH for packet access for mobile stations that have not enabled EC operation, (sub-clause 3.5.2),

  -	EC-CCCH for packet access for mobile stations that have enabled EC operation (sub-clause 3.5.2a),

  -	CCCH for  packet downlink assignment for mobile stations that have not enabled EC operation (sub-clause 3.5.3),

  -	EC-CCCH for packet downlink assignment for mobile stations that have enabled EC operation (sub-clause 3.5.5),  and

  -	CCCH for MBMS packet access (sub-clause 3.5.4).

At any point in time a mobile station may enable one of PEO or EC operation.  Support for GPRS services using GPRS TBFs or EGPRS TBFs is mandatory for a PEO capable mobile station and is optional for an EC capable mobile station.


3.5.1	Packet paging procedure using CCCH

The network can initiate the packet paging procedure in order to cause upper layers in the mobile station to respond, see clause 4. The packet paging procedure can only be initiated by the network.


3.5.1.1	Packet paging initiation by the network

The packet paging procedure is initiated by the RR entity of the network side. It is triggered by a page request from the MM sublayer, see 3GPP TS 24.007, or by an MBMS session start procedure or by an MBMS session update procedure in case of an MBMS notification, see 3GPP TS 48.018.

The network initiates the paging procedure by sending a paging request message on an appropriate paging subchannel on CCCH or PCCCH. Paging initiation using a paging subchannel on CCCH is used when sending paging information to a mobile station and PCCCH is not present in the cell.

  NOTE 1:	There are three types of paging request messages that are applicable:

         -	PAGING REQUEST TYPE 1;

         -	PAGING REQUEST TYPE 2; and

         -	PAGING REQUEST TYPE 3.

In a PAGING REQUEST message used for the packet paging procedure, the mobile station shall be identified by the P-TMSI (GPRS TMSI) or its IMSI. If the mobile station is identified by the P-TMSI, it shall proceed as specified in sub-clause 3.5.1.2.

In a paging request message used for MBMS notification, the MBMS session shall be identified by the TMGI and, if available, the MBMS Session Identity of that session, see sub-clause 3.5.1.3.

If the mobile station identified by its IMSI, it shall parse the message for a corresponding Packet Page Indication field:

    -	if the Packet Page Indication field indicates a paging procedure for RR connection establishment, or the field is not present in the message, the mobile station shall proceed as specified in sub-clause 3.3.2.2;

    -	if the Packet Page Indication field indicates a packet paging procedure, the mobile station shall proceed as specified in sub-clause 3.5.1.2.

A PAGING REQUEST message may include more than one mobile station identification.

The mobile station in packet idle mode is required to receive and analyse the paging messages and immediate assignment messages sent on the paging subchannels on CCCH corresponding to the paging groups determined for it in packet idle mode, as specified in 3GPP TS 45.002. These messages contain a page mode information element.

  NOTE 2:	The possible immediate assignment messages are: the IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT, the IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT EXTENDED, the IMMEDIATE PACKET ASSIGNMENT if supported and the IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT REJECT messages.

The treatment of page mode information, including the procedure when the mobile station selects a new PCH, and the procedure if a message in a paging subchannel is not received correctly are defined in sub-clause 3.3.2.1.1.

A PEO capable mobile station may negotiate the use of eDRX or PSM:

  -	If it successfully negotiates eDRX (enables eDRX) for paging based reachability it shall consider eDRX to be supported in all cells in the corresponding Routing Area (i.e. eDRX is negotiated at the Routing Area level).

  -	If it successfully negotiates PSM (with or without eDRX) it shall consider PSM to be supported in all cells in the corresponding Routing Area.

A PEO capable mobile station that has enabled eDRX wakes up to read a nominal paging group according to its negotiated eDRX as long as it remains in the same Routing Area it was in when it performed NAS signalling to enable eDRX regardless of whether or not PEO is enabled (see sub-clause 3.9.1).

An MS that has enabled PEO and is using eDRX shall ignore the "Paging reorganization" condition indicated by the page mode information element if received in any message (i.e. this condition targets mobile stations not using eDRX).

If PEO is enabled by a mobile station, after reading the message sent within its nominal paging group it shall use the RCC field in the message and the 6 bit BSIC field in the most recently read SCH to establish a BSIC (see 3GPP TS 45.008). If the BSIC does not match the BSIC value decoded upon first entering the serving cell (see 3GPP TS 45.008) or if the RCC and PEO_BCCH_CHANGE_MARK fields are not included in the message it shall consider PEO as disabled, abort the packet paging procedure and attempt cell re-selection.


3.5.1.2	On receipt of a packet paging request

On the receipt of a paging request message, the RR sublayer of addressed mobile station indicates the receipt of a paging request to the MM sublayer, see 3GPP TS 24.007.

An exception case is when a mobile station that has enabled PEO or EC operation and supports the MTA procedure or the MOTD procedure receives a paging request message that indicates a positioning event is pending (see sub-clauses 10.5.2.23, 10.5.2.24 and 10.5.2.25 for PEO and sub-clause 9.1.63 for EC operation). When this occurs the mobile station may perform a cell re-selection (see 3GPP TS 45.008 [34]) after which the RR sublayer of addressed mobile station indicates the receipt of a paging request to the MM sublayer, see 3GPP TS 24.007 [20].

Another exception case is when an EC-GSM-IoT capable mobile station, that has previously received an indication for restricted use of enhanced coverage (see 3GPP TS 24.008 [79]), receives a paging request message in (E)GPRS operation, while camping on a non-EC-GSM-IoT supporting cell, or in EC operation, while camping on an EC-GSM-IoT supporting cell, that indicates that the restricted use of enhanced coverage is removed. When this occurs, the mobile station may perform a cell re-selection (see 3GPP TS 45.008 [34]) after which the RR sublayer of addressed mobile station indicates the receipt of a paging request to the MM sublayer, see 3GPP TS 24.007 [20].


3.5.1.3	Packet Paging for MBMS notification on CCCH


3.5.1.3.1	General

The packet paging procedure for MBMS notification is initiated by the network upon receipt of an MBMS-SESSION-START-REQUEST PDU or of an MBMS-SESSION-UPDATE-REQUEST PDU from the SGSN, see 3GPP TS 48.018. The MBMS notification may be repeated during the session.

The packet paging procedure for MBMS notification consists of the following steps:

  -	optionally, the pre-notification of the MBMS session; and

  -	the notification of the MBMS session.

A mobile station in broadcast/multicast receive mode shall remain in broadcast/multicast receive mode if a paging procedure for a new MBMS session is not completed.

The network initiates the paging procedure for MBMS notification of an MBMS session by sending a paging message including either an MBMS pre-notification or an MBMS notification for that session on one or more paging subchannels on CCCH. The paging request message may be of type:

  -	PAGING REQUEST TYPE 1 message; or

  -	PAGING REQUEST TYPE 2 message.

The MBMS session shall be identified by the TMGI and, if available, the MBMS Session Identity of that session as contained in the MBMS-SESSION-START-REQUEST PDU or in the MBMS-SESSION-UPDATE-REQUEST PDU received from the SGSN.

The following requirements apply:

  -	If in the paging message the mobile station is at the same time (pre-)notified (see sub-clauses 3.5.1.3.2 and 3.5.1.3.3) and paged, the mobile station shall discard all (pre-)notification(s) in that message and proceed as described in sub-clause 3.3.2 or 3.5.1.1 and 3.5.1.2 accordingly.

  -	If in the paging message the mobile station is at the same time pre-notified (see sub-clause 3.5.1.3.2) and notified (see sub-clause 3.5.1.3.3), the mobile station shall discard all pre-notifications in that message and proceed as described in sub-clause 3.5.1.3.3.


3.5.1.3.2	MBMS pre-notification

In order to pre-notify an MBMS session on a CCCH, the network shall send a relevant paging request message (see sub-clause 3.5.1.3.1) including the TMGI and, if available, the MBMS Session Identity of that session. The network shall not include the MBMS Notification information.

Upon reception of a paging message including a pre-notifcation for an MBMS session, and if the mobile station requires reception of that session, the mobile station shall consider that session as being pre-notified (i.e. the mobile station is pre-notified). If the mobile station determines several pre-notified sessions in this message, the mobile station shall discard all pre-notifications but the pre-notification for the highest priority session. The mobile station in packet idle mode or MAC-Idle state shall then enter non-DRX mode, start timer T3220 and proceed as specified in sub-clause 3.5.1.3.3.

  NOTE:	In case all pre-notified sessions have the same priority, the selection of the highest priority session is implementation-dependent.

While timer T3220 is running, the mobile station shall stop timer T3220 and discard the pre-notification if:

  -	Any other RR procedure on CCCH not related to MBMS is triggered. The mobile station shall then proceed as per that procedure.

  -	A notification is received for a higher priority session. The mobile station shall then proceed as described in sub-clause 3.5.1.3.3.

If while timer T3220 is running the mobile station receives a pre-notification for a higher priority session, the mobile station shall discard the pre-notification for the lower priority session, remain in non-DRX mode, restart timer T3220 and proceed as specified in sub-clause 3.5.1.3.3.

Upon expiry of timer T3220, the mobile station in packet idle mode or MAC-Idle state shall return to DRX mode and discard the pre-notification. The mobile station in broadcast/multicast receive mode shall discard the pre-notification and remain in broadcast/multicast receive mode.

A mobile station in broadcast/multicast receive mode that is receiving an MBMS session shall ignore repeated pre-notifications of that session.


3.5.1.3.3	MBMS notification

In order to notify an MBMS session on CCCH, the network shall send a relevant paging request message (see sub-clause 3.5.1.3.1) including the following information:

  -	the TMGI and, if available, the MBMS Session Identity of that session;

  -	an indication whether counting shall be performed or not;

  -	optionally the MBMS p-t-m channel description allocated to that session and the estimated duration of the MBMS session or, if the MBMS session is ongoing, the estimated remaining duration of the MBMS session;

  -	optionally the MPRACH description.

  NOTE 1:	If the MBMS Session Repetition Number IE is included in the MBMS-SESSION-START-REQUEST PDU or in the MBMS-SESSION-UPDATE-REQUEST PDU (see 3GPP TS 48.018), the value part of this IE may be used by the network for e.g. deciding whether or not to perform the counting procedure or, in conjunction with the values of Allocation/Retention Priority IE (see 3GPP TS 48.018), whether or not to establish an MBMS radio bearer for the session.

Upon reception of a paging message including the notification of an MBMS session and if the mobile station requires reception of this session, the mobile station shall consider that session as being notified (i.e. the mobile station is notified). If the mobile station determines several notified sessions in this message, the mobile station shall act upon the notification for the highest priority session. The mobile station shall then stop timer T3220, if running, and proceed as specified in sub-clause 3.5.1.3.4.

  NOTE 2:	In case all notified sessions have the same priority, the selection of the highest priority session is implementation-dependent.

  NOTE 3:	Depending on its capabilities, the MS may act upon the notification for lower priority MBMS sessions provided it does not affect any of the following procedures for the highest priority MBMS session: response to MBMS notification (see sub-clause 3.5.1.3.4), MBMS packet access procedure on CCCH (see sub-clause 3.5.4).

A mobile station in broadcast/multicast receive mode that is receiving an MBMS session shall ignore repeated notifications of that session.


3.5.1.3.4	Response to MBMS notification

If the MBMS notification indicates that no counting shall be performed and contains no MBMS p-t-m channel description, the mobile station shall remain in or enter non-DRX mode and start timer T3214. The mobile station shall stop timer T3214 (specified in 3GPP TS 44.060) and proceed as specified in 3GPP TS 44.060 upon reception of an MBMS ASSIGNMENT message for that MBMS session. A mobile station in packet idle mode shall enter DRX mode upon expiry of T3214, and discard any corresponding notification. A mobile station in broadcast/multicast receive mode, i.e. engaged in one or more parallel MBMS session(s), shall remain in broadcast/multicast receive mode on expiry of T3214 and discard the corresponding notification.

While timer T3214 is running, the mobile station shall stop timer T3214 if:

  -	Any other RR procedure on CCCH not related to MBMS is triggered. The mobile station shall then proceed as per that procedure.

  -	A notification is received for a higher priority session. The mobile station shall then proceed as per that notification. Depending on its capabilities, the MS may act upon the notification for the lower priority MBMS session provided it does not affect any of the following procedures for the higher priority MBMS session: response to MBMS notification (see present sub-clause), MBMS packet access procedure on CCCH (see sub-clause 3.5.4).

If the MBMS notification indicates that counting shall be performed the mobile station shall perform an MBMS packet access procedure as specified in the sub-clause 3.5.4.

If the MBMS notification includes an MBMS p-t-m channel description, the mobile station shall set and start the session duration timer for this MBMS session with a value equal to the Estimated Session Duration (included in the MBMS Session Parameters List). If an MBMS Radio Bearer Starting Time parameter is not indicated or if the indicated starting time has elapsed, the mobile station shall switch to the assigned PDCH(s), start T3190 and listen for downlink RLC/MAC blocks for that session. If an MBMS Radio Bearer Starting Time parameter, that indicates a starting time that has not elapsed, is included, the mobile station shall wait until the point in time denoted by the MBMS Radio Bearer Starting Time parameter. It shall then switch to the assigned PDCHs, start timer T3190 and listen for downlink RLC/MAC blocks for that session. When receiving the first valid RLC/MAC block for that session, the mobile station shall restart timer T3190 and behave as described in 3GPP TS 44.060.

Upon expiry of T3190, the mobile station shall abort the procedure and return to packet idle mode or MAC-Idle state. The mobile station in broadcast/multicast receive mode shall abort the procedure and remain in broadcast/multicast receive mode.


3.5.1a	Packet paging procedure using EC-CCCH

The network can initiate the packet paging procedure in order to cause upper layers in a mobile station to respond, see clause 4. The packet paging procedure can only be initiated by the network (see subclause 3.5.1a.1 and sub-clauses 3.10.1 and 3.10.3).


3.5.1a.1	Packet paging initiation by the network

The packet paging procedure is initiated by the RR entity of the network side. It is triggered by a page request from the MM sublayer, see 3GPP TS 24.007.

The network initiates the paging procedure by sending an EC PAGING REQUEST message on an appropriate paging subchannel on EC-CCCH. Paging initiation using a paging subchannel on EC-CCCH is used when sending paging information to a mobile station that has enabled EC operation.

The EC PAGING REQUEST message shall identify the mobile station by the P-TMSI (GPRS TMSI) or its IMSI and may include more than one mobile station identification.

The mobile station in packet idle mode is required to receive and analyse the paging messages and immediate assignment messages sent on the paging subchannels on EC-CCCH corresponding to the paging groups determined for it in packet idle mode, as specified in 3GPP TS 45.002. The messages sent on EC-CCCH may contain an EC Page Extension field. The DL coverage class included in the paging request message shall refer to the highest coverage class of all mobile stations being addressed in the paging request message.

  NOTE 1:	The possible immediate assignment messages sent on EC-CCCH are the EC IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT TYPE 2, EC IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT TYPE 4, EC IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT REJECT and EC DOWNLINK ASSIGNMENT or EC DOWNLINK ASSIGNMENT TYPE 2 messages.

A mobile station that has enabled EC operation and has successfully negotiated eDRXdeterminess its nominal paging group as defined for EC operation (see 3GPP TS 45.002) according to its negotiated eDRX cycle and selected downlink coverage class. A mobile station that has enabled EC operation but has not negotiated eDRX determines its nominal paging group as defined for EC operation according to the lowest eDRX cycle, its IMSI and its selected downlink CC (see 3GPP TS 45.002). If it receives a matching paging message therein it shall act on it as described in sub-clause 3.5.1.2. Otherwise, if it receives any other message on the EC-PCH and the EC Page Extension field is included therein it shall proceed as follows:

  -	If the EC Page Extension field indicates paging extension is enabled for its downlink coverage class last communicated to the network (see 3GPP TS 45.008) it shall attempt to read one additional paging message using a paging group determined according to the downlink coverage class last communicated and the value of the Used DL Coverage Class field within the message where the EC Page Extension field was read as shown in Table 3.5.1a.1.

  -	If it finds a matching paging message therein it shall act on that message as described in sub-clause 3.5.1.2.

  -	If paging extension is not enabled or it does not find a matching paging message when attempting to read one additional paging message it sets its eDRX cycle to either the negotiated eDRX cycle (if eDRX has been negotiated) or the lowest eDRX cycle (if eDRX has not been negotiated), remains in packet idle mode and waits for the next instance of its nominal paging group.

  -	A mobile station that has enabled EC operation and has successfully negotiated eDRX shall, upon re-selecting to a cell in the same Routing Area that does not support EC operation, determine its nominal paging group as defined for PEO (see 3GPP TS 45.002 [32]) using its negotiated eDRX cycle length.

|Note 1: PG (Paging Group) represents the start of the coverage class specific EC-PCH block corresponding to the nominal paging group of an MS (see|
|3GPP TS 45.002 [32]). The start of the coverage class specific EC-PCH block used for page extension is expressed as an offset relative to PG      |
|(where the value of the offset indicates the number of coverage class specific EC-PCH blocks comprising the offset).                              |
|Note 2: Page Extension is determined using PG + 2 when a CC2 MS reading its nominal paging group in TDMA frames 35 to 42 (CC2 B2) or in TDMA      |
|frames 43 to 50 (CC2 B3) in MF N/N+1 determines that a CC4 page is ongoing from TDMA frames 35 to 50 in MF N/N+1/N+2/N+3. Page Extension is       |
|determined using Paging Group PG + 6 when a CC2 MS reading its nominal paging group in TDMA frames 19 to 26 (CC2 B0) or in TDMA frames 27 to 34   |
|(CC2 B1) in MF N/N+1 determines that a CC4 page is ongoing from TDMA frames 19 to 34 in MF N/N+1/N+2/N+3.                                         |
|Note 3: Page Extension is determined using Paging Group PG + 1 when a CC3 MS reading its nominal paging group in TDMA frames 35 to 50 (CC3 B1) in |

|frames 19 to 34 in MF N/N+1/N+2/N+3.                                                                                                              |


A mobile station that has enabled EC operation where PSM is used wakes up to read its nominal paging group according to the lowest eDRX cycle (if PSM was negotiated without a corresponding eDRX value) or its negotiated eDRX cycle (if PSM was negotiated with a corresponding eDRX value) while the Active timer is running. It continues to monitor its nominal paging group while the Active timer is running and if it receives a matching paging message therein it shall act on it as described in sub-clause 3.5.1.2. Otherwise, when the Active timer expires it stops monitoring its nominal paging group and remains in packet idle mode until its next uplink data transmission.

The nominal paging group a mobile station monitors takes into account the selected downlink Coverage Class (see sub-clause 3.10.3, 3GPP TS 45.002 [32] and 3GPP TS 45.008 [34]) indicated during its most recent system access (e.g. transmission of an EC PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST message – see sub-clause 9.1.65) that resulted in the successful transmission of an uplink LLC PDU (e.g. a cell update). This downlink Coverage Class information is always provided to the BSS when it receives a PAGING-PS PDU from the SGSN.

An EC capable MS whose last uplink transmission was in a cell that does not support EC-GSM-IoT may choose to enable EC operation upon reselection to a cell that supports EC-GSM-IoT. In this case it shall perform an uplink transmission (e.g. a cell update) to update the network (i.e. addition of Coverage Class information) and therefore be reachable for pages on the EC-PCH.

If EC operation is enabled in the serving cell a MS that supports GPRS services using GPRS/EGPRS TBFs may choose to disable EC operation in which case it shall perform an uplink transmission (e.g. a cell update) to update the network (i.e. removal of Coverage Class information) and therefore be reachable for pages on the PCH. Similarly, if EC operation is enabled in the serving cell a MS that supports GPRS services using GPRS/EGPRS TBFs may reselect to a cell that supports both EC-GSM-IoT and GPRS/EGPRS TBFs and choose to disable EC operation, in which case it shall perform an uplink transmission (e.g. a cell update) to update the network (i.e. removal of Coverage Class information) and therefore be reachable for pages on the PCH.

If EC operation is enabled in the serving cell a MS that performs reselection to a cell that does not support EC-GSM-IoT is not required to perform an uplink transmission (e.g. a cell update) to update the network in the new cell (i.e. the network retains Coverage Class information). An EC capable MS whose last uplink transmission was in a cell that does not support EC-GSM-IoT may choose to not enable EC operation upon reselection to a cell that supports EC-GSM-IoT in which case it is not required to perform an uplink transmission (e.g. a cell update) to update the network in the new cell. For both of these cases the MS is reachable for pages on the PCH as follows:

  -	If it has not negotiated eDRX it shall listen to the PCH using DRX applicable to that cell (indicated by system information – see 3GPP TS 44.018).

  -	If it has negotiated eDRX it shall listen to the PCH using its negotiated eDRX cycle.

  -	If it has negotiated PSM it shall listen to the PCH when the Active timer is running using DRX applicable to that cell (if PSM was negotiated without eDRX) or using the negotiated eDRX (if PSM was negotiated with eDRX.)

  -	When the MS monitors the PCH using the negotiated eDRX cycle it shall determine its nominal paging group as described in sub-clause 3.5.1 for the case of a PEO capable mobile station that has enabled eDRX.

For the case where a mobile station is unable to read any message sent on EC-PCH or EC-AGCH when waking up according to its nominal paging group it returns to idle mode and waits for the next instance of its nominal paging group.


3.5.2	Packet access procedure using CCCH

The packet access procedure using CCCH may be used to establish a temporary block flow to support the transfer of LLC PDUs in the direction from the mobile station to the network. Establishment using one phase and two phase packet access, see 3GPP TS 44.060 [76], are supported. The two phase packet access is supported by means of the single block or multiple block packet access option in this procedure, allowing the transfer of a PACKET RESOURCE REQUEST and possibly an ADDITIONAL MS RADIO ACCESS CAPABILITIES message to the network.

The single block packet access option in this procedure may also be used by a mobile station in packet idle mode to transfer an RLC/MAC control message other than the PACKET RESOURCE REQUEST message to the network, see sub-clause 3.5.2.2.

The single block MBMS access option in this procedure shall be used by a mobile station in packet idle mode to transfer the RLC/MAC control message MBMS SERVICE REQUEST message network, see sub-clause 3.5.4.

A MS that has enabled PEO (i.e. eDRX or PSM – see 3GPP TS 23.060 [74]) while in a cell that supports PEO, shall send an EGPRS PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST message with access type ‘PEO One Phase Access Request’ (see Table 3.5.2.1.2.2 and 3GPP TS 44.060 [76]) when attempting to establish a PS connection. An exception case is when the MS is accessing the network to perform the Multilateration Timing Advance (MTA) procedure (see sub-clause 3.11 and 3GPP TS 44.031) in a cell that supports MTA (see the MTA_BITMAP field described in sub-clause 10.5.2.37b) in which case it sends an EGPRS MULTILATERATION REQUEST message specific to the MTA method it is using (see sub-clause 3.5.2.1.2 and 3GPP TS 44.060 [76]). Another exception case is when the MS is accessing the network to send a Page Response due to receiving a page indicating ‘pending positioning event’ (see sub-clause 10.5.2.23, sub-clause 10.5.2.24 and sub-clause 10.5.2.25) in a cell that supports MTA in which case the MS sends an EGPRS MULTILATERATION REQUEST message indicating ‘Page Response for Positioning Event’ (see 3GPP TS 44.060 [76]).


3.5.2.1	Entering the packet transfer mode: packet access procedure

The establishment of an uplink temporary block flow may be initiated by the RR entity of the mobile station using the packet access procedure. The procedure is triggered by a request from upper layers to transfer a LLC PDU, see 3GPP TS 24.007. The request from upper layers specifies radio priority and an RLC mode associated with the packet transfer or it indicates that the packet to be transferred contains signalling.

Upon such a request,

  -	if access to the network is allowed (sub-clause 3.5.2.1.1), the RR entity of the mobile station initiates the packet access procedure as defined in sub-clause 3.5.2.1.2;

  -	otherwise, it rejects the request.

If the request from upper layers indicates signalling, the highest radio priority level shall be used at determination if access to the network is allowed, and the acknowledged RLC mode shall be requested.


3.5.2.1.1	Permission to access the network

A mobile station configured for EAB and has enabled EAB (i.e. it has received EAB Authorization Mask and EAB Subcategory information for its selected PLMN from SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 21) shall, prior to proceeding with a mobile originated access attempt, re-read SI21 if more than 30 seconds have expired since the last time it read SI21.

For a mobile originated access attempt, a mobile station configured for EAB and that has enabled EAB shall perform a preliminary access barring check (see sub-clause 3.3.1.4) unless it receives an indication from the upper layers to override EAB or it is attempting system access to perform the Multilateration Timing Advance (MTA) procedure (see sub-clause 3.11 and TS 3GPP 44.031) in which case access to the network is allowed. If the preliminary access barring check indicates network access is barred then access to the network is not allowed. Otherwise, the mobile station shall proceed according to the remainder of this sub-clause.

Access to the network is allowed:

  -	if the mobile station is a member of at least one authorized access class or special access class as defined in sub-clause 3.3.1.1.1; and

  -	if packet access is allowed in the cell for the radio priority level associated with the packet transfer, as indicated by the PRIORITY_ACCESS_THR parameter broadcast in SI 13 message;

  -	if the cell belongs to one of the allowed LSAs for the mobile station, as indicated on the SIM, in the case where the mobile station is a LSA only access subscriber.


3.5.2.1.2	Initiation of the packet access procedure: channel request

A mobile station accessing the network when the low priority indicator is set to "MS is configured to NAS signalling low priority" (see 3GPP TS 24.008 [79]), when accessing the network to perform the packet access procedure, shall, while ignoring MS identities included within PAGING REQUEST messages, start listening to the downlink CCCH until successfully decoding one of the RR messages listed in sub-clause 3.3.1.1.1a. A MS that has enabled PEO shall read the PEO_BCCH_CHANGE_MARK field and the RCC field within the successfully decoded RR message. It shall use the 6 bit BSIC from the most recently read SCH and the RCC field from the decoded RR message to establish a BSIC (see 3GPP TS 45.008).  If the BSIC does not match the BSIC value decoded upon first entering the serving cell (see 3GPP TS 45.008) it shall abort the packet access procedure and attempt cell re-selection.   If a change of PEO BCCH CHANGE MARK is detected it shall first read SI13 before proceeding with the packet access procedure. If the RR message indicates an implicit reject for the PS domain (see sub-clause 3.3.1.1.1a) the mobile station shall abort the packet access procedure and initiate the implicit reject procedure (see sub-clause 3.3.1.1.3.2a). An exception case is where the mobile station has enabled EC operation and is sending an EC PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST message using the RACH (the RACH Access Control field indicates that RACH usage on timeslot number 0 is allowed, see sub-clause 3.5.2a) in which case it proceeds with the packet access without first decoding one of the RR messages listed in sub-clause 3.3.1.1.1a and checking the status of the PEO_BCCH_CHANGE_MARK field and implicit reject information sent therein.

A MS that has enabled PEO accessing the network to perform packet access when the low priority indicator is set to "MS is not configured for NAS signalling low priority" shall also listen to the downlink CCCH until successfully decoding one of the RR messages listed in sub-clause 3.3.1.1.1a and read the PEO_BCCH_CHANGE_MARK field and RCC field therein. It shall use the 6 bit BSIC from the most recently read SCH and the RCC field from the decoded RR message to establish a BSIC.  If the BSIC does not match the BSIC value decoded upon first entering the serving cell (see 3GPP TS 45.008) or if the RCC and PEO_BCCH_CHANGE_MARK fields are not included in the message it shall consider PEO as disabled, abort the packet access procedure and attempt cell re-selection.  If a change of PEO_BCCH_CHANGE_MARK is detected then it shall first read SI13 prior to performing the packet access. If it determines that the PEO_DSC field is not included in the SI13 Rest Octets IE it shall consider PEO as disabled, abort the packet access procedure and attempt cell re-selection.

The network indicates the RCC value corresponding to the serving cell within an IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT message using the IA Rest Octets IE (see sub-clause 10.5.2.16) or within an IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT REJECT message using the IAR Rest Octets IE (see sub-clause 10.5.2.17) or within an IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT EXTENDED message using the IAX Rest Octets IE (see sub-clause 10.5.2.18) or within an IMMEDIATE PACKET ASSIGNMENT message using the IPA Rest Octets IE (see sub-clause 10.5.2.78) or within a PAGING REQUEST TYPE 1 message using the P1 Rest Octets IE (see sub-clause 10.5.2.23) or within a PAGING REQUEST TYPE 2 message using the P2 Rest Octets IE (see sub-clause 10.5.2.24) or within a PAGING REQUEST TYPE 3 message using the P3 Rest Octets IE (see sub-clause 10.5.2.25).

A mobile station that has enabled PEO shall, when attempting to establish a PS connection and while ignoring MS identities included within PAGING REQUEST messages, be able to successfully decode an RR message within 500ms of starting to listen to the downlink CCCH. Otherwise, the packet access procedure is aborted, a random access failure is indicated to upper layers and autonomous cell re-selection is performed according to 3GPP TS 43.022.

If a MS that has enabled PEO does not detect a change in the PEO_BCCH_CHANGE_MARK and the time elapsed since it last read SI13 exceeds 24 hours it should read SI13 before proceeding with the packet access procedure.

A mobile station initiates the packet access procedure by leaving idle mode and scheduling the sending of CHANNEL REQUEST or EGPRS PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST or EC PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST messages on RACH as described in sub-clause 3.3.1.1.2 (i.e. only the portion of sub-clause 3.3.1.1.2 describing message scheduling is used when the packet access procedure is initiated as described in this sub-clause). The cause to be used in the CHANNEL REQUEST message for a non-EGPRS TBF mode capable MS or an EGPRS TBF mode capable MS in a non-EGPRS capable cell depends on the purpose of the packet access procedure as follows:

  -	If the purpose of the packet access procedure is to send user data and the requested RLC mode is unacknowledged mode, the mobile station shall request a single block packet access and attempt a two phase packet access.

  -	If the purpose of the packet access procedure is to send user data and the requested RLC mode is acknowledged mode, the mobile station shall request either a one phase packet access or a single block packet access.

  -	If the purpose of the packet access procedure is to send a Page Response, a Cell update (the mobile station was in GMM READY state before the cell reselection) or for any other GPRS Mobility Management or GPRS Session Management procedure, the mobile station shall request a one phase packet access. An exception case is when the purpose of the packet access procedure is to send a Page Response due to receiving a page indicating ‘pending positioning event’ (see sub-clause 10.5.2.23, sub-clause 10.5.2.24 and sub-clause 10.5.2.25), in which case the mobile station shall send an EGPRS MULTILATERATION REQUEST message indicating ‘Page Response for Positioning Event’ (see 3GPP TS 44.060 [76]).

  -	If the purpose of the packet access procedure is to send a Measurement Report, the mobile station shall request a single block packet access.

  -	If the purpose of the packet access procedure is to send a PACKET PAUSE message, the mobile station shall request a single block packet access. Upon sending the first CHANNEL REQUEST message the mobile station shall start timer T3204. If timer T3204 expires before an IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT message granting a single block period on an assigned packet uplink resource is received, the packet access procedure is aborted. If the mobile station receives an IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT message during the packet access procedure indicating a packet downlink assignment procedure, the mobile station shall ignore the message.

  -	If the purpose of the packet access procedure is to send an MBMS SERVICE REQUEST message to the network, the mobile station shall request a single block MBMS access.

  -	If the purpose of the packet access procedure is to send a signalling message and the mobile station is accessing the network when the low priority indicator is set to "MS is configured to NAS signalling low priority" it shall use the single block packet access option.

A mobile station that has enabled PEO starts the radio access part of the MTA procedure upon receiving a RRLP Multilateration Timing Advance Request message (see 3GPP TS 44.031) if both the MS and the serving cell support the MTA procedure method indicated therein (see the MTA_BITMAP field described in sub-clause 10.5.2.37b). In this case it starts the MPM timer and starts accessing the network using cells it has selected to perform the radio access part of the MTA procedure. For each selected cell it compares the BSIC of the CCCH to the BSIC. If the BSIC does not match it does not perform the radio access part of the MTA procedure using that cell. If the BSIC matches it does not check the status of the PEO_BCCH_CHANGE_MARK field and implicit reject information sent for that cell, sends an EGPRS MULTILATERATION REQUEST message (see 3GPP TS 44.060 [76]) and proceeds as follows:

  -	If the EGPRS MULTILATERATION REQUEST message indicates the RLC Data block method is used (see sub-clause 3.11 and 3GPP TS 44.060 [76]) it includes a random reference which is drawn randomly from a uniform probability distribution for every new transmission. After transmitting this message and receiving a matching IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT message (see sub-clause 9.1.18) or IMMEDIATE PACKET ASSIGNMENT message (see sub-clause 9.1.18b) it transmits a RLC data block containing MTA related parameters (see 3GPP TS 44.060 [76]) therein. After receiving a corresponding acknowledgement on the PACCH (see 3GPP TS 44.060 [76]) the MS tunes to the next cell in the list of applicable cells and continues the procedure therein. After performing the radio access part of the MTA procedure in all applicable cells or when the MPM timer expires it returns to idle mode in the cell it was in when the radio access part of the MTA procedure was triggered.

  -	If the EGPRS MULTILATERATION REQUEST message indicates the Access Burst method is used (see sub-clause 3.11 and 3GPP TS 44.060 [76]) it includes a Short ID parameter. After transmitting this message and receiving a matching IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT message (see sub-clause 9.1.18) or IMMEDIATE PACKET ASSIGNMENT message (see sub-clause 9.1.18b) it tunes to the next cell in the list of applicable cells and performs the radio access part of the MTA procedure therein. After performing the radio access part of the MTA procedure in all applicable cells or when the MPM timer expires it returns to idle mode in the cell it was in when the radio access part of the MTA procedure was triggered.

  -	If the Extended Access Burst method is used (see sub-clause 3.11) it sends a first EGPRS MULTILATERATION REQUEST message indicating ‘Extended Access Burst – part 1’ using the Access burst format (see 3GPP TS 45.002 [32]) and includes the "Random ID Low" and "MS Transmission Offset" parameters therein. After receiving a matching IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT message (see sub-clause 9.1.18) or IMMEDIATE PACKET ASSIGNMENT message (see sub-clause 9.1.18b) it sends a second EGPRS MULTILATERATION REQUEST message indicating ‘Extended Access Burst – part 2’ using the Extended Access burst format (see 3GPP TS 45.002 [32]) and includes the "Random ID Low", the "MS Sync Accuracy", the "Random ID High" and the "Short BSS ID" parameters therein. After receiving a matching IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT message or IMMEDIATE PACKET ASSIGNMENT message for the second EGPRS MULTILATERATION REQUEST message it tunes to the next cell in the list of applicable cells and performs the radio access part of the MTA procedure therein. After performing the radio access part of the MTA procedure in all applicable cells or when the MPM timer expires it returns to idle mode in the cell it was in when the radio access part of the MTA procedure was triggered.

  -	The MS shall not send an EGPRS PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST message with access type ‘PEO One Phase Access Request’ while performing the radio access part of the MTA procedure except for the case of a high priority transmission (i.e. ‘PEO Priority’ = 1, see 3GPP TS 44.060 [76]) in which case it shall stop the MPM timer and terminate the MTA procedure. When a BSS receives an uplink LLC PDU while the MPM timer is running for the corresponding MS it informs the SMLC that no additional timing advance information is pending for the corresponding MTA procedure (see 3GPP TS 49.031), stops the MPM timer and terminates the MTA procedure for that MS.


EGPRS TBF mode capable mobile stations shall monitor the GPRS Cell Options IE on the BCCH (SI13) for the cell's EGPRS capability and, if the mobile station is also Reduced Latency capable, the cell’s Reduced Latency Access capability. In the GPRS Cell Options IE it is also indicated if the EGPRS PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST message is supported in the cell and if Reduced Latency Access is supported in the cell. An exception case is where a MS has enabled PEO and is attempting to establish a PS connection in which case the EGPRS PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST message is sent regardless of whether or not the GPRS Cell Options IE indicates the EGPRS PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST message is supported in that cell. If the mobile station supports the IMMEDIATE PACKET ASSIGNMENT message, the mobile station shall monitor cell’s capability for IMMEDIATE PACKET ASSIGNMENT message within paging messages received on its own paging sub-channel. Table 3.5.2.1.2.1 specifies which message and which establishment cause shall be used by an EGPRS mobile station when accessing an EGPRS capable cell depending on the purpose of the packet access procedure, and mobile station’s and cell’s capabilities for the case where the cell does not support PEO or EC operation; this table covers the case where PBCCH is not present in the cell (see 3GPP TS 44.060 for the case where PBCCH is present in the cell). Table 3.5.2.1.2.2 specifies which message and which establishment cause shall be used by a mobile station when PEO is enabled. Table 3.5.2.1.2.3 specifies which message and which establishment cause shall be used by a mobile station when EC operation is enabled and the RACH Access Control field (see sub-clause 9.1.30c) indicates the RACH is to be used by mobile stations that have selected coverage class 1 in both uplink and downlink. The network shall not indicate Reduced Latency Access is supported if the EGPRS PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST message is not indicated as supported. The network shall not indicate IMMEDIATE PACKET ASSIGNMENT message is supported if the EGPRS PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST message is not indicated as supported.

Upon leaving idle mode the mobile station shall ignore PAGING REQUEST messages indicating a packet paging procedure.

A mobile station belonging to GPRS MS class A or B shall continue to monitor its paging subchannel on CCCH for PAGING REQUEST messages indicating an establishment of RR connection. A mobile station belonging to GPRS MS class B may abort the packet access procedure at the receipt of a PAGING REQUEST messages indicating an establishment of RR connection. An exception is the case of a MS that has enabled PEO or EC operation in which case the MS never monitors its paging subchannel on CCCH for PAGING REQUEST messages indicating an establishment of RR connection (see sub-clause 3.3.1).

The CHANNEL REQUEST or EGPRS PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST messages are sent on RACH and contain the parameters:

  -	an establishment cause which indicates packet access, and as applicable, a request for one phase packet access, single block packet access or a single block MBMS access for a CHANNEL REQUEST (sub-clause 9.1.8), or a request for one phase access or two phase access or short access or sending of signalling data for an EGPRS PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST (see 3GPP TS 44.060);

  -	a random reference which is drawn randomly from an uniform probability distribution for every new transmission;

  -	a capability indication which indicates the support of IMMEDIATE PACKET ASSIGNMENT for an EGPRS PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST (see 3GPP TS 44.060).


The EGPRS MULTILATERATION REQUEST message is sent on RACH and indicates packet access by a mobile station that has enabled PEO operation and is accessing the network to send a ‘Page Response for Positioning Event’ or to a perform the radio access part of a MTA procedure using one of the following methods:

  -	If the RLC Data block method is used (see sub-clause 3.11) this message includes a random reference which is drawn randomly from a uniform probability distribution for every new transmission.

  -	If the Access Burst method is used (see sub-clause 3.11) this message includes a Short ID parameter (see sub-clause 3.5.2.1.2 and 3GPP TS 44.060 [76]).

  -	If the Extended Access Burst method is used (see sub-clause 3.11) the first instance of this message includes the "Random ID Low" and "MS Transmission Offset" parameters and the second instance of this message includes the "Random ID Low", "MS Sync Accuracy", "Random ID High" and the "Short BSS ID" parameters (see sub-clause 3.5.2.1.2 and 3GPP TS 44.060 [76]).

Prior to sending an EGPRS PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST or EGPRS MULTILATERATION REQUEST message on the RACH a MS shall determine the applicable CCCH_GROUP as follows:

  -	If eDRX is enabled or it is attempting to enable eDRX the MS shall determine its CCCH_GROUP as per idle mode when extended DRX cycles are used (see 3GPP TS 45.002 [32]).

  -	Otherwise, the MS shall determine its CCCH_GROUP as per idle mode when extended DRX cycles are not used (see 3GPP TS 45.002 [32]).

The EC PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST messages are sent on RACH and indicate packet access by a mobile station that has enabled EC operation where the included parameters are as described in sub-clause 9.1.65. Prior to sending an EC PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST message on the RACH the MS shall set CCCH_GROUP = 0 (see sub-clauses 3.5.2.1.2 and 9.1.30c).

After sending the first CHANNEL REQUEST or EGPRS PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST or EGPRS MULTILATERATION REQUEST message, the mobile station shall start listening to the full downlink CCCH timeslot corresponding to its CCCH_GROUP. After sending the first EC PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST message a mobile station that has enabled EC operation shall listen to the downlink CCCH timeslot using CCCH_GROUP = 0 (see 3GPP TS 45.002). In addition, a mobile station that has sent a CHANNEL REQUEST or EGPRS PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST or EGPRS MULTILATERATION REQUEST message shall start listening to the BCCH to perform signal strength measurements as they are defined for packet idle mode, see 3GPP TS 45.008. A mobile station that has sent an EC PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST message need not perform signal strength measurements.

A mobile station accessing the network to perform the radio access part of a MTA procedure (see TS 3GPP 44.031) or accessing the network when the low priority indicator is set to "MS is configured to NAS signalling low priority" (see 3GPP TS 24.008) that has sent one or more CHANNEL REQUEST or EGPRS PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST or EC PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST or EGPRS MULTILATERATION REQUEST messages shall proceed as follows:

  -	If the mobile station receives an IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT, an IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT EXTENDED, an EC IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT TYPE 1 (if EC operation is enabled), an IMMEDIATE PACKET ASSIGNMENT (if supported) or an IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT REJECT message corresponding to one of its last 3 transmitted CHANNEL REQUEST or EGPRS PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST or EC PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST or EGPRS MULTILATERATION REQUEST messages it shall act on that message as described in sub-clause 3.5.2.1.3.

  -	If the mobile station successfully decodes an RR message, which is not a response corresponding to one of its last 3 transmitted CHANNEL REQUEST or EGPRS CHANNEL REQUEST or EC PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST messages, that indicates an implicit reject for the PS domain (see sub-clause 3.3.1.1.1a) it shall start timer T3146 (if not already running) and initiate the implicit reject procedure as described in sub-clause 3.3.1.1.3.2a.

  -	If the mobile station has enabled PEO and has sent one or more EGPRS MULTILATERATION REQUEST messages in a cell that supports MTA then it shall ignore the implicit reject information when received in an RR message which is not a response corresponding to one of its last 3 transmitted EGPRS MULTILATERATION REQUEST messages.

  -	If a mobile station sends a EGPRS MULTILATERATION REQUEST message indicating ‘RLC Data Block method’ or ‘Page Response for Positioning Event’ (see 3GPP TS 44.060 [76]) a matching IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT message includes "Request Reference" information that matches the Random Bits and TDMA Frame information used by the MS when sending the EGPRS MULTILATERATION REQUEST message (see sub-clause 10.5.2.30). Simlialrly, a matching IMMEDIATE PACKET ASSIGNMENT message includes Random Reference information that matches the 11 bits of information included within the EGPRS MULTILATERATION REQUEST message.

  -	If a mobile station sends a EGPRS MULTILATERATION REQUEST message indicating ‘Access Burst method’ (see 3GPP TS 44.060 [76]) a matching IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT or IMMEDIATE PACKET ASSIGNMENT message includes the same "Short ID" parameter value used by the MS when sending the EGPRS MULTILATERATION REQUEST message (see sub-clause 10.5.2.87).

  -	If a mobile station sends a EGPRS MULTILATERATION REQUEST message indicating ‘Extended Access Burst method – part 1’ (see 3GPP TS 44.060 [76]) a matching IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT or IMMEDIATE PACKET ASSIGNMENT message includes the same "Random ID Low" parameter value used by the MS when sending the EGPRS MULTILATERATION REQUEST message (see sub-clause 10.5.2.87).

  -	If a mobile station sends a EGPRS MULTILATERATION REQUEST message indicating ‘Extended Access Burst method – part 2’ (see 3GPP TS 44.060 [76]) a matching IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT or IMMEDIATE PACKET ASSIGNMENT message message includes the same "Random ID High" parameter value used by the MS when sending the EGPRS MULTILATERATION REQUEST message (see sub-clause 10.5.2.87).

Having sent the maximum number of CHANNEL REQUEST or EGPRS PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST or EC PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST or EGPRS MULTILATERATION REQUEST messages, the mobile station starts timer T3146. At expiry of timer T3146, if the packet access procedure is ongoing then it is aborted, a random access failure is indicated to upper layers and autonomous cell re-selection is performed according to 3GPP TS 43.022. At expiry of timer T3146, if the radio access part of the MTA procedure is ongoing then it is aborted for the current cell and the mobile station MS tunes to the next cell in the list of applicable cells and continues the radio access part of the MTA procedure therein.

If the mobile station receives an IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT or IMMEDIATE PACKET ASSIGNMENT message (if supported) during the packet access procedure indicating a packet downlink assignment procedure, the mobile station shall abort the packet access procedure and respond to the IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT or the IMMEDIATE PACKET ASSIGNMENT message as specified in sub-clause 3.5.3.1.2 or sub-clause 3.5.3.2. If the Packet Downlink Assignment IE in IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT message or IPA Downlink Assignment struct in IMMEDIATE PACKET ASSIGNMENT message indicates a downlink TBF, the mobile station shall then attempt an establishment of uplink TBF, using the procedure specified in 3GPP TS 44.060 which is applicable in packet transfer mode. If the Packet Downlink Assignment IE in IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT message indicates a downlink single block then the mobile station shall wait for the allocated single block and react on the received message before reattempting the uplink TBF establishment.


3.5.2.1.2a	EC Packet access procedure (EC-CCCH)

The RR entity of a mobile station initiates the packet access procedure by scheduling the sending of EC PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST or EC MULTILATERATION REQUEST messages (see Table 3.5.2.1.2a.1 and sub-clause 9.1.65) as follows:

  -	Using the 1TS EC-RACH Mapping method if CC1 has been selected on the uplink or if Access_Timeslots=0, sent in EC SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 2.

  -	Using the 2TS EC-RACH Mapping method if CC2, CC3, CC4 or CC5 has been selected on the uplink and Access_Timeslots=1, sent in EC SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 2has been selected on the uplink and Access_Timeslots=1, sent in EC SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 2.

  -	When the 2TS EC-RACH Mapping method for CC2, CC3 and CC4 is used the EC-RACH is mapped over two consecutive timeslots, and the EC PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST messages sent across the 2 timeslots shall be identical and shall use the same training sequence code (i.e one of TS5, TS6 or TS7 is used according to the uplink CC).

  -	When the 2TS EC-RACH Mapping method is used for CC5 and EC SI 2 parameter CC5_EC-RACH_FORMAT_IND (see sub-clause 9.1.43q) indicates usage of ESAB, then EC-RACH CC5 transmissions are performed using ESAB (see 3GPP TS 45.002 [32])).

  -	When the 2TS EC-RACH Mapping method is used for CC5 and EC SI 2 parameter CC5_EC-RACH_FORMAT_IND (see sub-clause 9.1.43q) indicates usage of EDAB, then EC-RACH CC5 transmissions are performed using EDAB (see 3GPP TS 45.002 [32])).

See 3GPP TS 45.002 for details regarding coverage class specific rules for multiplexing blind physical layer transmissions using the 2 TS EC-RACH.

Prior to sending an EC PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST or EC MULTILATERATION REQUEST message on the EC-RACH a MS shall determine the applicable EC_CCCH_GROUP as per idle mode for EC-GSM-IoT (see 3GPP TS 45.002 [32]).

After scheduling the transmission of EC PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST or EC MULTILATERATION REQUEST messages it leaves idle mode (in particular, the mobile station shall ignore EC PAGING REQUEST messages).

|or ‘Extended Access Burst’ method or ‘Access Burst method.       |                                                                           |
|NOTE 1: An EC capable MS in a cell that does not support EC-GSM-IoT shall operate according to Table 3.5.2.1.2.1 if it supports GPRS TBFs or |
|EGPRS TBFs.                                                                                                                                  |


The mobile station then sends maximally M + 1 EC PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST or EC MULTILATERATION REQUEST messages where each message is repeated according to the number of blind physical layer transmissions corresponding to its uplink CC.  The first EC PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST or EC MULTILATERATION REQUEST message is sent using a transmission opportunity corresponding to its uplink coverage class randomly selected (with uniform probability distribution) from a set of Tcc 51-multiframes on the EC-RACH/RACH as shown in Table 3.5.2.1.2a.2.  When sending a page response the set of Tcc 51-multiframes starts with the first 51-multiframe immediately following the last 51-multiframe used for receiving the corresponding paging request. For a mobile originated access attempt the set of Tcc 51-multiframes starts with the first 51-multiframe (following the 51-multiframe during which upper layers requested the transfer of a LLC PDU) that contains a transmission opportunity corresponding to its uplink coverage class.

Table 3.5.2.1.2a.2: Values of parameters Scc and Tcc

|                |Scc                     |Tcc               |
|CC1             |Sm                      |Tm                |
|CC2             |Sm                      |Tm                |
|CC3             |2*Sm                    |2*Tm              |
|CC4             |4*Sm                    |2*(Tm+1)          |
|CC5             |4*Sm                    |3*(Tm+2)          |


The value for Sm is sent in the EC SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 2 message and is used for determining the Scc value applicable for monitoring the EC-AGCH according to the selected downlink coverage class of the mobile station.

The value for Tm is sent in the EC SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 2 message and is used for determining the Tcc value applicable for randomly selecting an EC-RACH (and possibly RACH) transmission opportunity corresponding to the selected uplink coverage class of the mobile station.

M is the value of the parameter "EC_Max_Retrans" sent in the EC SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 2 message.

The EC PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST message (see sub-clause 9.1.65) contains the following parameters:

  -	a random reference field which is drawn randomly from a uniform probability distribution for every new transmission;

  -	a field indicating the downlink coverage class selected by the mobile station (only included when the message is sent on EC-RACH);

  -	a field indicating the signal strength measured by the MS (only included when the message is sent on RACH);

  -	a field indicating the purpose of the data transfer ("page response", "cell update", "RLC/MAC control message" or "uplink data transfer") and the number of uplink data blocks it has to send (assuming MCS-1 channel coding is used);

  -	a field indicating the priority of the packet access request.

A mobile station that has enabled EC operation starts the radio access part of the MTA procedure upon receiving a RRLP Multilateration Timing Advance Request message (see 3GPP TS 44.031) if both the MS and the serving cell support the MTA procedure method indicated therein (see the MTA_BITMAP field described in sub-clause 10.5.2.37b). In this case it starts the MPM timer and starts accessing the network using cells it has selected to perform the radio access part of a MTA procedure. For each selected cell it compares the BSIC of the EC-CCCH to the BSIC. If the BSIC does not match it does not perform the radio access part of the MTA procedure using that cell. If the BSIC matches it does not check the status of the EC-BCCH CHANGE MARK field and implicit reject status information sent for that cell, sends a EC MULTILATERATION REQUEST message (see sub-clause 9.1.65) and proceeds as follows:

  -	If the EC MULTILATERATION REQUEST message indicates the RLC Data block method is used (see sub-clause 3.11) it includes a random reference which is drawn randomly from a uniform probability distribution for every new transmission and a field indicating the downlink coverage class selected by the mobile station (see sub-clause 9.1.65). After transmitting this message and receiving a matching EC IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT TYPE 2 message it transmits a RLC data block containing MTA related parameters (see 3GPP TS 44.060 [76]) therein. After receiving a corresponding acknowledgement on the EC-PACCH (see 3GPP TS 44.060 [76]) the MS tunes to the next cell in the list of applicable cells and continues the procedure therein. After performing the radio access part of the MTA procedure in all applicable cells or when the MPM timer expires it returns to idle mode in the cell it was in when the radio access part of the MTA procedure was triggered.

  -	If the EC MULTILATERATION REQUEST message indicates the Access Burst method is used (see sub-clause 3.11) it includes a Short ID parameter (see sub-clause 9.1.65). After transmitting this message and receiving a matching EC IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT TYPE 3 message (see sub-clause 9.1.68) it tunes to the next cell in the list of applicable cells and performs the radio access part of the MTA procedure therein. After performing the radio access part of the MTA procedure in all applicable cells or when the MPM timer expires it returns to idle mode in the cell it was in when the radio access part of the MTA procedure was triggered.

  -	If the Extended Access Burst method is used (see sub-clause 3.11) it sends a first EC MULTILATERATION REQUEST message indicating ‘Extended Access Burst method – part 1’ using the Access burst format (see 3GPP TS 45.002 [32]) and includes the "Random ID Low" and "MS Transmission Offset" parameters therein (see sub-clause 9.1.65). After receiving a matching EC IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT TYPE 3 message (see sub-clause 9.1.68) it sends a second EC MULTILATERATION REQUEST message indicating ‘Extended Access Burst method – part 2’ using the Extended Access burst format (see 3GPP TS 45.002 [32]) and includes the "Random ID Low", the "MS Sync Accuracy", the "Random ID High" and the "Short BSS ID" parameters therein. After receiving a matching EC IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT TYPE 3 message for the second EC MULTILATERATION REQUEST message it tunes to the next cell in the list of applicable cells and performs the radio access part of the MTA procedure therein. After performing the radio access part of the MTA procedure in all applicable cells or when the MPM timer expires it returns to idle mode in the cell it was in when the radio access part of the MTA procedure was triggered.

  -	The MS shall not send an EC PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST message while performing the radio access part of the MTA procedure except for the case of a high priority transmission (i.e. ‘EC Priority’ = 1, see sub-clause 9.1.65) in which case it shall stop the MPM timer and abort the MTA procedure. When a BSS receives an uplink LLC PDU while the MPM timer is running for the corresponding MS it informs the SMLC that no additional timing advance information is pending for the corresponding MTA procedure (see 3GPP TS 49.031), stops the MPM timer and terminates the MTA procedure for that MS.


After sending the first EC PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST or EC MULTILATERATION REQUEST message or a subsequent retransmission, the mobile station shall start reading the EC-AGCH (according to the downlink coverage class indicated within the corresponding EC PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST or EC MULTILATERATION REQUEST message) in an attempt to find a response matching its last transmission.

  -	For the case where the EC MULTILATERATION REQUEST message indicates ‘RLC Data Block method’ or ‘Page Response for Positioning Event’ (see sub-clause 9.1.65) a matching EC IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT TYPE 2 message (see sub-clause 9.1.60) includes "EC Request Reference" information that matches the Random Bits and TDMA Frame information used by the MS when sending the EC MULTILATERATION REQUEST message (see sub-clause 10.5.2.83).

  -	For the case where the EC MULTILATERATION REQUEST message indicates ‘Access Burst method’ (see sub-clause 9.1.65) a matching EC IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT TYPE 3 message (see sub-clause 9.1.68) indicates a downlink coverage class corresponding to the training sequence used by the MS and includes the same "Short ID" parameter value used by the MS when sending the EC MULTILATERATION REQUEST message.

  -	For the case where the EC MULTILATERATION REQUEST message indicates ‘Extended Access Burst method – part 1’ (see sub-clause 9.1.65) a matching EC IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT TYPE 3 message indicates downlink coverage class 1 and includes the same "Random ID Low" parameter value used by the MS when sending the EC MULTILATERATION REQUEST message.

  -	For the case where the EC MULTILATERATION REQUEST message indicates ‘Extended Access Burst method – part 2’ (see sub-clause 9.1.65) a matching EC IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT TYPE 3 message indicates downlink coverage class 1 and includes the same "Random ID High" parameter value used by the MS when sending the EC MULTILATERATION REQUEST message.

  -	A MS that has selected downlink CC1 shall begin looking for a matching response starting within downlink 51-multiframe N (i.e. N = TDMA FN div 51) if it used uplink 51-multiframe N to send the last blind physical layer transmission of the EC PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST or EC MULTILATERATION REQUEST message and there is at least one remaining valid CC1 reception opportunity in downlink 51-multiframe N. If a matching response is not found or there are no remaining valid CC1 reception opportunities within downlink 51-multiframe N it shall start reading 51-multiframe N+1in an attempt to find a matching response. The total number of downlink 51-multiframes it reads (excluding downlink 51-multiframe N) in an attempt to find a matching response is determined by Scc (see Table 3.5.2.1.2a.2).

  -	A MS that has selected downlink CC2 shall begin looking for a matching response starting within downlink 51-multiframe N if it used uplink 51-multiframe N to send the last blind physical layer transmission of the EC PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST or EC MULTILATERATION REQUEST message, N mod 2 = 0 and there is at least one remaining valid CC2 reception opportunity that starts in downlink 51-multiframe N. If a matching response is not found using downlink 51-multiframes N and N+1 or there are no remaining valid CC2 reception opportunities that start within downlink 51-multiframe N it shall start reading downlink 51-multiframe N+1 (respectively N+2) if N mod 2 = 1 (respectively N mod 2 = 0). The total number of downlink 51-multiframes it reads (excluding downlink 51-multiframe N) in an attempt to find a matching response is determined by Scc (see Table 3.5.2.1.2a.2).

  -	A MS that has selected downlink CC3 shall begin looking for a matching response starting with downlink 51-multiframe N+1 (respectively N+2) when it used uplink 51-multiframe N to send the last blind physical layer transmission of the EC PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST or EC MULTILATERATION REQUEST message where N mod 2 = 1 (respectively N mod 2 = 0). The total number of downlink 51-multiframes it reads in an attempt to find a matching response is determined by Scc (see Table 3.5.2.1.2a.2).

  -	A MS that has selected downlink CC4 shall begin looking for a matching response starting with downlink 51-multiframe N+1 (respectively N+2, N+3, N+4) when it used uplink 51-multiframe N to send the last blind physical layer transmission of the EC PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST or EC MULTILATERATION REQUEST message where N mod 4 = 3 (respectively N mod 4 = 2, 1, 0). The total number of downlink 51-multiframes it reads in an attempt to find a matching response is determined by Scc (see Table 3.5.2.1.2a.2).

A mobile station accessing the network when the low priority indicator is set to "MS is configured to NAS signalling low priority" (see 3GPP TS 24.008) that has sent one or more EC PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST or EC MULTILATERATION REQUEST messages shall proceed as follows:

  -	If, while reading the total number of downlink 51-multiframes determined by Scc, the mobile station receives an EC IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT TYPE 2, EC IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT TYPE 4 or an EC IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT REJECT or an EC IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT TYPE 3 message corresponding to its last transmitted EC PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST or EC MULTILATERATION REQUEST message it shall act on that message as described in sub-clause 3.5.2.1.3a.

  -	If a matching response is not found and the mobile station is not sending an exception report (see sub-clause 9.1.65) it shall examine the Implicit Reject Status (IRS) field sent as part of the EC-SCH INFORMATION message (see sub-clause 9.1.30c).  If the IRS field indicates the access attempt is rejected the mobile station shall abort the packet access procedure, start timer T3146 (if not already running) and initiate the EC Implicit Reject procedure (see sub-clause 3.5.2a.2). An exception case is where a mobile station is performing the radio access part of the MTA procedure in a cell that supports MTA (see the MTA_BITMAP field described in sub-clause 9.1.43q) in which case it shall not examine the IRS field.

  -	Otherwise, the MS schedules the sending of another EC PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST or EC MULTILATERATION REQUEST message (if allowed according to "EC_Max_Retrans") using a transmission opportunity corresponding to its uplink coverage class randomly selected (with uniform probability distribution) from a set of Tcc 51-multiframes on the EC-RACH (determined using Tm as shown in Table 3.5.2.1.2a.2).

  -	The set of Tcc 51-multiframes starts with the first 51-multiframe (following the set of Scc downlink 51-multiframe read in attempt to find a matching response or following the last downlink 51-multiframe read to acquire the IRS field) that contains a transmission opportunity corresponding to its uplink coverage class.

  -	When scheduling another EC PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST or EC MULTILATERATION REQUEST message the MS uses the "CC_Access_Adaptation" parameter (broadcast in EC SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 2 message) to determine if it is allowed to increment both its uplink CC and downlink CC to the next CC supported by the network (unless it is already using CC4).

  -	Upon incrementing its uplink/downlink CC the number of subsequent EC PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST or EC MULTILATERATION REQUEST message transmission attempts that may occur before it is allowed to increment its uplink/downlink CC once again is the same as when sending the first EC PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST message (i.e. determined by the "CC_Access_Adaptation" parameter).

  -	When sending up to M + 1 EC PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST or EC MULTILATERATION REQUEST messages the MS may increment its uplink CC and downlink CC a maximum of 2 times if CC adaptations are allowed according to the "CC_Access_Adaptation" parameter.

Having sent M + 1 EC PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST or EC MULTILATERATION REQUEST messages, the RR entity of the mobile station starts timer T3146 at the start of the first of the set of downlink 51-multiframes (excluding downlink 51-multiframe N) it reads in an attempt to find a matching response as determined by Scc (see Table 3.5.2.1.2a.2). At expiry of timer T3146, if the packet access procedure is ongoing then it is aborted, a random access failure is indicated to upper layers and autonomous cell re-selection is performed according to 3GPP TS 43.022. At expiry of timer T3146, if the radio access part of the MTA procedure is ongoing then it is aborted for the current cell and the mobile station tunes to the next cell in the list of applicable cells and continues the radio access part of the MTA procedure therein.


3.5.2.1.3	Packet immediate assignment


3.5.2.1.3.1	On receipt of a CHANNEL REQUEST or EGPRS PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST or EC PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST message or EGPRS MULTILATERATION REQUEST

On receipt of a CHANNEL REQUEST message indicating a packet access, the network may allocate a temporary flow identity and assign a packet uplink resource comprising one PDCH for an uplink temporary block flow in GPRS TBF mode. On receipt of an EGPRS PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST message, the network may allocate a temporary flow identity and assign a packet uplink resource comprising one PDCH for an uplink temporary block flow in EGPRS TBF mode or GPRS TBF mode.

On receipt of an EC PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST message on the RACH, the network may allocate a temporary flow identity and assign pre-allocated packet uplink resources comprising one or several PDCHs for an uplink temporary block flow in EC TBF mode.

On receipt of an EGPRS MULTILATERATION REQUEST message on the RACH (see 3GPP TS 44.060 [76]), the network proceeds according the Multilateration Timing Advance (MTA) method indicated therein (see sub-clause 3.5.2.1.2 and 3.11).

If the establishment cause in the CHANNEL REQUEST message indicates a request for a single block packet access, the network shall grant only the single block period on the assigned packet uplink resource if the network allocates resource for the mobile station. If the establishment cause in the EGPRS PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST message indicates a request for a two phase access, the network shall grant one or two radio blocks for the mobile station (within a Multi Block allocation) to send a PACKET RESOURCE REQUEST and possibly an ADDITIONAL MS RADIO ACCESS CAPABILITIES messages on the assigned packet uplink resource if the network allocates resource for the mobile station.

If the establishment cause in the CHANNEL REQUEST message indicates a request for one phase packet access, the network may grant either a one phase packet access or a single block packet access for the mobile station. If a single block packet access is granted, it forces the mobile station to perform a two phase packet access. If the establishment cause in the EGPRS PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST message indicates a request for one phase packet access or sending signalling data, the network may grant either a one phase packet access or a two phase access (within a Multi Block allocation). If a multiple block packet access is granted, it forces the mobile station to perform a two phase packet access. In the case of a MS that has enabled PEO the establishment cause always indicates a one phase access and the network shall prioritize the granting of a one phase packet access.

When EC operation is not enabled the packet uplink resource is assigned to the mobile station in an IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT or an IMMEDIATE PACKET ASSIGNMENT message (if supported) sent in unacknowledged mode on the same CCCH timeslot on which the network has received the CHANNEL REQUEST or the EGPRS PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST message. The network may assign packet resource to the mobile station in an IMMEDIATE PACKET ASSIGNMENT message if the received EGPRS PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST message indicates the support of this assignment message. There is no further restriction on what part of the downlink CCCH timeslot the IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT and IMMEDIATE PACKET ASSIGNMENT message can be sent. Timer T3141 is started on the network side.

When EC operation is enabled the packet uplink resource is assigned to the mobile station in an EC IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT TYPE 1 message sent in unacknowledged mode on the same CCCH timeslot on which the network received the EC PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST message (see Table 3.5.2.1.2.3). Timer T3141 is started on the network side.

The IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT and EC IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT TYPE 1 messages contain:

  -	the information field of the CHANNEL REQUEST, the EGPRS PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST or the EC PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST message and the frame number of the frame in which the CHANNEL REQUEST, the EGPRS PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST or the EC PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST message was received;

  -	the packet channel description;

  -	the initial timing advance;

  -	the packet uplink assignment or EGPRS packet uplink assignment construction (only applies to the IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT message).

  -	the packet resources used for the uplink EC TBF which includes the set of pre-allocated uplink resources described by the EC Fixed Uplink Allocation IE (only applies to the EC IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT TYPE 1 message).

The IMMEDIATE PACKET ASSIGNMENT message contains parameters relevant to the assignment of packet resources as specified in subclauses 3.5.2.1.3.2 and 3.5.2.1.3.3.

If frequency hopping is applied, the network may use the indirect encoding or the direct encoding of the frequency configuration in the Packet Channel Description information element in IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT message or in the IPA Uplink Assignment struct, IPA Downlink Assignment struct, or IPA Single Block Uplink Assignment struct in IMMEDIATE PACKET ASSIGNMENT message. If the indirect encoding is used, the mobile station uses information received in system information or stored from a previous assignment to determine the frequency parameters, see 3GPP TS 44.060. If the direct encoding is used, the mobile station uses the cell allocation defined for the cell to decode the mobile allocation.

If the indirect encoding is used, the IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT or IMMEDIATE PACKET ASSIGNMENT message may contain a CHANGE_MARK_1 field. If that is present, the mobile station shall verify the validity of the SI13_CHANGE_MARK associated with the GPRS mobile allocation to which the message refers, see 3GPP TS 44.060. If the CHANGE_MARK_1 field and the SI13_CHANGE_MARK do not match, the message does not satisfactorily define a PDCH.

If EC operation is enabled the network indicates the frequency configuration in the EC Packet Channel Description Type 1 information element (see sub-clause10.5.2.84) in the EC IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT TYPE 1 message.

If the mobile station receives an IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT message and the Dedicated mode or TBF information element indicates that this is the first message in a two-message assignment, the mobile station shall continue to listen to the full CCCH. The network may send a second IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT message to the mobile station within two multiframe periods following the first IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT message, specifying the packet channel description and, if required, a mobile allocation for the assignment. The two IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT messages in a two-message assignment shall have the same contents of the Request Reference information elements.

If the mobile station does not receive the second IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT messages in a two-message assignment within two multiframe periods following the first message, the mobile station shall discard the first IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT message received.

On receipt of an IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT message or, in case of a two-message assignment, a matching pair of IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT messages corresponding to one of its 3 last CHANNEL REQUEST or EGPRS PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST messages, the mobile station stops T3146 (if running), stops sending CHANNEL REQUEST or EGPRS PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST messages, and switches to the assigned PDCH.

On receipt of an IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT or IMMEDIATE PACKET ASSIGNMENT message (see sub-clauses 9.1.18 and sub-clause 9.1.18b) corresponding to one of its 3 last EGPRS MULTILATERATION REQUEST messages (see 3GPP TS 44.060 [76]), the mobile station stops T3146 (if running), stops sending EGPRS MULTILATERATION REQUEST messages, and proceeds as follows:

  -	If the EGPRS MULTILATERATION REQUEST message indicated ‘Page Response for Positioning Event’ (see sub-clause 3.5.2.1.2 and 3GPP TS 44.060 [76]) the mobile station switches to the assigned PDCH and transmits a RLC Data Block thereon. Upon receiving a corresponding Ack the mobile station returns to Idle mode.

  -	If the EGPRS MULTILATERATION REQUEST message indicated ‘RLC Data Block method’ (see sub-clause 3.5.2.1.2 and 3GPP TS 44.060 [76]) the mobile station switches to the assigned PDCH and transmits a RLC Data Block thereon. Upon receiving a corresponding Ack the mobile station considers the radio access part of the MTA procedure as successfully completed in the current cell, tunes to the next cell in the list of applicable cells and performs the radio access part of the MTA procedure therein.

  -	If the EGPRS MULTILATERATION REQUEST message indicated ‘Access Burst method’ (see sub-clause 3.5.2.1.2 and 3GPP TS 44.060 [76]) the mobile station considers the radio access part of the MTA procedure as successfully completed in the current cell, tunes to the next cell in the list of applicable cells and performs the radio access part of the MTA procedure therein.

  -	If the EGPRS MULTILATERATION REQUEST message indicated ‘Extended Access Burst method – part 1’ (see sub-clause 3.5.2.1.2 and 3GPP TS 44.060 [76]) the mobile station starts sending EGPRS MULTILATERATION REQUEST messages indicating ‘Extended Access Burst method – part 2.

  -	If the EGPRS MULTILATERATION REQUEST message indicated ‘Extended Access Burst method – part 2’ (see sub-clause 3.5.2.1.2 and 3GPP TS 44.060 [76]) the mobile station considers the radio access part of the MTA procedure as successfully completed in the current cell, tunes to the next cell in the list of applicable cells and performs the radio access part of the MTA procedure therein.


On receipt of an EC IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT TYPE 1 message corresponding to one of its 3 last EC PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST messages on the RACH, the mobile station stops T3146 (if running), stops sending EGPRS PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST messages, and switches to the assigned PDCH(s).

The content of the packet uplink assignment construction (respectively EGPRS packet uplink assignment construction indicates which type of packet access is granted: one phase packet access or single (respectively multiple) block packet access.


3.5.2.1.3.2	One phase packet access

In the case the one phase packet access is granted, the packet uplink assignment construction contains:

  -	the temporary flow identity;

  -	the USF value

  -	the channel coding scheme for RLC data blocks;

  -	the power control parameters;

  -	the polling bit;

  -	optionally, the timing advance index (see 3GPP TS 45.010);

  -	optionally, the TBF starting time.

In addition, the EGPRS packet uplink assignment construction also contains:

  -	the EGPRS modulation and coding scheme;

  -	information whether retransmitted uplink data blocks shall be resegmented or not;

  -	the EGPRS window size to be used within the transmission; and

  -	optionally a request for the mobile station to send its radio access capability information.

In addition, if sent in response to a one phase access with access type indicating "One Phase Access Request by Reduced Latency MS" as defined in 3GPP TS 44.060, the EGPRS packet uplink assignment construction also allows:

  -	the possibility to assign an uplink EGPRS TBF on  a maximum of  two uplink PDCH pairs situated on consecutive or on non-consecutive timeslots for RTTI configuration;

  -	the inclusion of an indication if RTTI or BTTI USF mode is used;

  -	the inclusion of an indication of whether the SSN-based or Time-Based approach shall be used for PAN fields.

The medium access method is dynamic allocation and the RLC mode is acknowledged mode, see 3GPP TS 44.060.

If the timing advance index (TAI) is included in the packet uplink assignment construction, the mobile station shall use the continuous update timing advance mechanism, see 3GPP TS 45.010, using PTCCH in the same timeslot as the assigned PDCH. If a timing advance index (TAI) field is not included, the continuous update timing advance mechanism shall not be used.

In case the packet uplink assignment or EGPRS packet uplink assignment construction contains a TBF starting time and the mobile station receives the message before the TBF starting time has expired, it shall wait until the frame number indicated by the TBF starting time before accessing the channel. If the mobile station receives the message after the TBF starting time has expired, it shall ignore the TBF starting time and may immediately access the channel. If the medium access method is dynamic allocation, the mobile station shall start timer T3164. Regardless of which allocation mode is used, the mobile station shall proceed with the contention resolution at one phase access defined in 3GPP TS 44.060.

If the Polling bit is set to 1, MS shall send a PACKET CONTROL ACKNOWLEDGEMENT message (see 44.060) on the assigned PDCH, in the uplink block specified by the TBF Starting Time. In this case the TBF Starting Time is used both to indicate when the assigned PDCH becomes valid and to specify the uplink block. If the TBF Starting Time is not present or has expired, the MS shall ignore the polling request.

When the mobile station switches to the assigned PDCH, it shall take the power control parameters received in the IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT or the IMMEDIATE PACKET ASSIGNMENT message into account, perform signal strength measurements and apply output power control procedures as they are defined for packet transfer mode, see 3GPP TS 45.008.

In the case the one phase packet access is granted to MS supporting IMMEDIATE PACKET ASSIGNEMENT, the IPA Uplink Assignment struct sent in the IMMEDIATE PACKET ASSIGNMENT message may assign packet uplink resource for multiple mobile stations and contain following parameters specific to different mobile stations:

  -	the temporary flow identity;

  -	the USF value;

  -	the EGPRS channel coding command for RLC data block;

  -	the timing advance value;

  -	the Radio Access Capabilities Request bit.

In addition, the IPA Uplink Assignment struct contains the timeslot number which is common to all mobile stations addressed in this construction. Relevant default values shall be used for the RLC window size, Alpha, RESEGMENT and USF_GRANULARITY parameters as specified in subclause 10.5.2.78.

If the Radio Access Capability Request bit is set to 1, mobile stations addressed in the IPA Uplink Assignment struct in the IMMEDIATE PACKET ASSIGNMENT message shall send MS Radio Access Capability 2 IE in PACKET RESOURCE REQUEST message.

When assigning an EGPRS TBF, the network may request information about radio access capabilities of the mobile station on one or several frequency bands within the IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT or the IMMEDIATE PACKET ASSIGNMENT message; the list of frequency bands is ordered by the network starting with the most important and ending with the least important one. The mobile station shall provide the network with its radio access capabilities for the frequency bands it supports, in the same priority order as the one specified by the network, by sending a PACKET RESOURCE REQUEST message, and an ADDITIONAL MS RADIO ACCESS CAPABILITIES if all the requested informations do not fit in the PACKET RESOURCE REQUEST. If the mobile station does not support any frequency band requested by the network, it shall report its radio access capabilities for the BCCH frequency band. The mobile station shall indicate in the PACKET RESOURCE REQUEST if it will send more information about its radio access capabilities in the ADDITIONAL MS RADIO ACCESS CAPABILITIES message. The PACKET RESOURCE REQUEST and the ADDITIONAL MS RADIO ACCESS CAPABILITIES shall be sent within the one or two first radio blocks allocated for the mobile station on the assigned PDCH.

The network may request a retransmission of the PACKET RESOURCE REQUEST and the ADDITIONAL MS RADIO ACCESS CAPABILITIES messages. A request for retransmission of one or both of these messages shall be indicated in the PACKET UPLINK ACK/NACK message. The mobile station has to indicate within the PACKET RESOURCE REQUEST if the message is a retransmitted one.

In the case of an uplink EGPRS TBF assignment in RTTI configuration where an IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT message is sent in response to a one phase access with access type indicating "One Phase Access Request by Reduced Latency MS" as defined in 3GPP TS 44.060, the assigned timeslots of the uplink PDCH pair(s) and the corresponding downlink PDCH pair (as defined in 3GPP TS 44.060) associated with each assigned uplink PDCH pair are indicated by a combination of the TN given by the Packet Channel Description information element and information in the EGPRS Packet Uplink Assignment construction of the IA Rest Octets information element as described in sub-clause 10.5.2.16.


3.5.2.1.3.3	Single block packet access

In the case the single block packet access is granted, the packet uplink resource description contains:

  -	the power control parameter setting;

  -	the TBF starting time.

In the case the single block packet access is granted to a mobile station supporting IMMEDIATE PACKET ASSIGNMENT message, the IPA Single Block Uplink Assignment struct sent in the IMMEDIATE PACKET ASSIGNMENT message may assign one uplink block for multiple mobile stations and contains the following parameters specific to different mobile stations:

  -	the power control parameter setting;

  -	the timing advance value;

  -	the relative TBF starting time; and

  -	the frequency parameters.

In addition, the IPA Single Block Uplink Assignment struct contains the timeslot number which is common to all mobile stations addressed in this construction.

If the mobile station receives the IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT or IMMEDIATE PACKET ASSIGNMENT message before the TBF starting time has expired, it shall wait until the block period indicated by the TBF starting time. The network shall use the TBF starting time to indicate the first frame number belonging to the single block period granted for packet access. The mobile station may either use the assigned block period to send a PACKET RESOURCE REQUEST message to initiate the two phase packet access procedure defined in 3GPP TS 44.060, or to send an RLC/MAC control message other than the PACKET RESOURCE REQUEST message to the network, see sub-clause 3.5.2.2.

If the mobile station receives the IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT or IMMEDIATE PACKET ASSIGNMENT message after the TBF starting time has expired, a failure has occurred.

If a failure occurs and the packet access attempt was due to a request from upper layers to transfer a LLC PDU, a TBF establishment failure has occurred and the mobile station proceeds as specified in sub-clause 3.5.2.1.5. If a failure occurs and the packet access attempt was due to the sending of an RLC/MAC control message, the packet access is aborted, the mobile station returns to packet idle mode.


3.5.2.1.3.3a	Multiblock packet access

In the case the multiblock packet access is granted, the EGPRS packet uplink assignment description contains:

  -	timeslot number of the allocation and the number of blocks allocated;

  -	the power control parameter setting;

  -	the TBF starting time.

When assigning a multiblock packet access, the network may request information about radio access capabilities of the mobile station on one or several frequency bands within the IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT message and allocate one or two radio blocks for uplink control messages accordingly ; the list of frequency bands is ordered by the network starting with the most important and ending with the least important one. The mobile station shall then provide the network with its radio access capabilities for the frequency bands it supports, in the same priority order as the one specified by the network, by sending a PACKET RESOURCE REQUEST message in the first radio block on the assigned PDCH, and an ADDITIONAL MS RADIO ACCESS CAPABILITIES immediately after the PACKET RESOURCE REQUEST message on the assigned PDCH if all the requested informations do not fit in the PACKET RESOURCE REQUEST and two radio blocks have been allocated by the network. If the mobile station does not support any frequency band requested by the network, it shall report its radio access capabilities for the BCCH frequency band in the PACKET RESOURCE REQUEST message. The mobile station shall indicate in the PACKET RESOURCE REQUEST if it will send more information about its radio access capabilities in the ADDITIONAL MS RADIO ACCESS CAPABILITIES message. If the mobile station has been allocated two radio blocks and all the requested informations fit in the PACKET RESOURCE REQUEST message, no ADDITIONAL MS RADIO ACCESS CAPABILITIES message shall be sent (see 3GPP TS 44.060). Instead, some uplink control block (e.g. packet measurement report, packet uplink dummy control block) may be sent by the mobile station.

The network may indicate in the next PACKET UPLINK ASSIGNMENT message a request for retransmission of the ADDITIONAL MS RADIO ACCESS CAPABILITIES message (see 3GPP TS 44.060).

If the mobile station receives the IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT message before the TBF starting time has expired, it shall wait until the block period indicated by the TBF starting time. The network shall use the TBF starting time to indicate the first frame number belonging to the multi block period granted for packet access. If the mobile station receives the IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT message after the TBF starting time has expired, a failure has occurred.

If a failure occurs and the packet access attempt was due to a request from upper layers to transfer a LLC PDU, a TBF establishment failure has occurred and the mobile station proceeds as specified in sub-clause 3.5.2.1.5. If a failure occurs and the packet access attempt was due to the sending of an RLC/MAC control message, the packet access is aborted, the mobile station returns to packet idle mode.


3.5.2.1.3.4	Packet access rejection

The network may send to the mobile station an IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT REJECT message in unacknowledged mode on the same CCCH timeslot on which the channel request message was received. There is no further restriction on what part of the downlink CCCH timeslot an IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT REJECT message can be sent. This message contains the request reference and a wait indication.

On receipt of an IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT REJECT message corresponding to one of its 3 last CHANNEL REQUEST or EGPRS PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST messages or  EC PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST messages, the mobile station stops sending CHANNEL REQUEST or EGPRS PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST or EC PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST messages, starts timer T3142 with the indicated value, ("wait indication" information element), starts T3146 if it has not already been started, and listens to the downlink CCCH or EC-CCCH until T3146 expires. During this time, additional IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT REJECT messages are ignored, but any immediate assignment corresponding to any other of its 3 last CHANNEL REQUEST or EGPRS PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST or EC PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST messages make the mobile station follow the procedure in sub-clause 3.5.2.1.3.1. If no such immediate assignment is received (i.e. T3146 expires), the mobile station shall abort the packet access procedure, return to packet idle mode and notify higher layers (TBF establishment failure).

If the purpose of the packet access procedure is to send a PACKET PAUSE message and an IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT REJECT message is received, the packet access procedure is aborted.

If the mobile station has not received responses from the network on all, or in case more than 3 were sent the last 3, of its CHANNEL REQUEST or EGPRS PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST or EC PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST messages, it shall abort the packet access procedure, immediately return to packet idle mode and notify higher layers.

The mobile station is not allowed to make a new attempt for packet access in the same cell until T3142 expires, but may attempt packet access in an other cell after successful cell reselection for radio conditions reasons (see 3GPP TS 45.008). The value of the wait indication (i.e. T3142) relates to the cell from which it was received.

The mobile station may initiate RR connection establishment in the same cell before T3142 has expired, see sub-clause 3.3.1.1.3.2 and subclause 3.3.1.


3.5.2.1.3a	Packet immediate assignment (EC-CCCH)


3.5.2.1.3a.1	On receipt of an EC PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST or EC MULTILATERATION REQUEST message

On receipt of an EC PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST message on the EC-RACH (see Table 3.5.2.1.2a.1), the network may allocate a temporary flow identity and assign pre-allocated packet uplink resources comprising one or four PDCHs (determined by the uplink coverage class of the mobile station) for an uplink temporary block flow in EC TBF mode.

When an EC PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST message is transmitted on the EC-RACH it implicitly indicates a request for an uplink EC TBF. Packet uplink resources are assigned to the mobile station in an EC IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT TYPE 2 or EC IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT TYPE 4 message sent on the same EC-CCCH timeslot on which the network has received the EC PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST message.

On receipt of an EC IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT TYPE 2 or EC IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT TYPE 4 message corresponding to its last EC PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST or EC MULTILATERATION REQUEST (see sub-clause 9.1.65) message, the mobile station stops T3146 (if running), stops sending EC PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST or EC MULTILATERATION REQUEST messages, and switches to the assigned PDCH(s).

The EC IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT TYPE 2 or EC IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT TYPE 4 message contains:

  -	The downlink coverage class used when transmitting the message;

  -	optionally, an indication of page extension information;

  -	the 3 random bits of the information field of the EC PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST message and the 10 least significant bits of the frame number of the frame in which the EC PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST message was received;

  -	the EC_MA_NUMBER;

  -	training sequence code (TSC) information;

  -	the temporary flow identity;

  -	the EGPRS modulation and coding scheme for RLC data blocks;

  -	the power control parameters;

  -	optionally, the initial timing advance;

  -	the packet resources used for the uplink TBF which includes the set of pre-allocated uplink resources described by the EC Fixed Uplink Allocation IE;

  -	an indication of the uplink and downlink coverage class the MS is to use on the assigned packet resources;

  -	an indication of the quarter hyperframe used to send the EC IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT TYPE 2 or EC IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT TYPE 4 message.

The EC_MA_NUMBER field of the EC Packet Channel Description Type 2 IE (see sub-clause 10.5.2.85) indicates the mobile allocation set to be used for EC operation.

When the mobile station switches to the assigned PDCH(s), it shall take the power control parameters received in the EC IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT TYPE 2 or EC IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT TYPE 4 message into account.

On receipt of an EC IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT TYPE 3 message (see sub-clause 9.1.68) corresponding to its last EC MULTILATERATION REQUEST message when the Access Burst method is used (see sub-clause 3.5.2.1.2a), the mobile station stops T3146 (if running), stops sending EC MULTILATERATION REQUEST messages, considers the radio access part of the MTA procedure as successfully completed in the current cell, tunes to the next cell in the list of applicable cells and performs the radio access part of the MTA procedure therein. In this case the EC IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT TYPE 3 message contains:

  -	The downlink coverage class set according to the uplink coverage class used when transmitting the corresponding EC MULTILATERATION REQUEST message;

  -	optionally, an indication of page extension information;

  -	the 8 bit Short ID field included within the corresponding EC MULTILATERATION REQUEST message.

On receipt of an EC IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT TYPE 3 message (see sub-clause 9.1.68) corresponding to its last EC MULTILATERATION REQUEST message indicating ‘Extended Access Burst method – part 1’ (see sub-clause 3.5.2.1.2a), the mobile station stops T3146 (if running), stops sending EC MULTILATERATION REQUEST messages indicating ‘Extended Access Burst method – part 1’, restarts TT3146 and starts sending EC MULTILATERATION REQUEST messages indicating ‘Extended Access Burst method – part 2’. In this case the EC IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT TYPE 3 message contains:

  -	Downlink coverage class 1;

  -	optionally, an indication of page extension information;

  -	the "Random ID Low" parameter included in the corresponding EC MULTILATERATION REQUEST message;

  -	timing advance information.

On receipt of an EC IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT TYPE 3 message (see sub-clause 9.1.68) corresponding to its last EC MULTILATERATION REQUEST message indicating ‘Extended Access Burst method – part 2’ (see sub-clause 3.5.2.1.2a), the mobile station stops T3146 (if running), stops sending EC MULTILATERATION REQUEST messages indicating ‘Extended Access Burst method – part 2’, considers the radio access part of the MTA procedure as successfully completed in the current cell, tunes to the next cell in the list of applicable cells and performs the radio access part of the MTA procedure therein. In this case the EC IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT TYPE 3 message contains:

  -	Downlink coverage class 1;

  -	optionally, an indication of page extension information;

  -	the "Random ID" parameter (derived from the "Random ID Low" parameter included in the first EC MULTILATERATION REQUEST message and the "Random ID High" parameter included in the second EC MULTILATERATION REQUEST message).



3.5.2.1.3a.2	Packet access rejection

The network may send to the mobile station an EC IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT REJECT message in unacknowledged mode on the same EC-CCCH timeslot on which the EC PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST message was received. There is no further restriction on what part of the downlink EC-CCCH timeslot an EC IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT REJECT message can be sent. This message contains the EC Request Reference and EC Wait Timer information.

On receipt of an EC IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT REJECT message corresponding to its last EC PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST message, the mobile station stops sending EC PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST messages, starts timer T3142 with the indicated value, (determined by the corresponding "EC Wait Timer" field), starts T3146 if it has not already been started, and listens to the downlink EC-CCCH until T3146 expires. During this time, additional EC IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT REJECT messages are ignored, but upon reception of any immediate assignment corresponding to its last EC PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST message it switches to the assigned PDCH(s) as described in sub-clause 3.5.2.1.3a. If no such immediate assignment is received (i.e. T3146 expires), the mobile station aborts the packet access procedure, returns to packet idle mode and notifies higher layers (TBF establishment failure).

The mobile station is not allowed to make a new attempt for packet access in the same cell until T3142 expires, but may attempt packet access in another cell after successful cell reselection for radio conditions reasons (see 3GPP TS 45.008). The value of the EC Wait Timer field (i.e. T3142) relates to the cell from which it was received.

The mobile station may initiate RR connection establishment in the same cell before T3142 has expired, see sub-clause  3.3.1.


3.5.2.1.4	Packet access completion

The one phase packet access procedure is completed at a successful contention resolution. The mobile station has entered the packet transfer mode. Timer T3141 is stopped on the network side. Timer T3164 is stopped on the mobile station side.


3.5.2.1.4a	Packet access completion (EC-CCCH)

The packet access procedure is completed at a successful contention resolution. The mobile station has entered the packet transfer mode. Timer T3141 is stopped on the network side. Timer T3164 is stopped on the mobile station side.


3.5.2.1.5	Abnormal cases

If a failure occurs on the mobile station side before a successful contention resolution procedure is completed, the allocated temporary block flow is released; the mobile station returns to packet idle mode, upper layers are notified (TBF establishment failure), transactions in progress are aborted:

  -	If a TLLI mismatch has occurred during the contention resolution procedure, and the repetition of the packet access has been repeated the maximum number of times as defined in 3GPP TS 44.060, a TBF establishment failure has occurred.

  -	If the information available in the mobile station, after the reception of an IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT or IMMEDIATE PACKET ASSIGNMENT or the second IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT message of a two-message assignment, does not satisfactorily define a PDCH, a TBF establishment failure has occurred.

  -	If the information available in the mobile station, after the reception of an EC IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT TYPE 1 message indicates a starting uplink timeslot other than timeslot 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4 for a mobile station using CC2, CC3 or CC4 on the uplink, a TBF establishment failure has occurred.

  -	If the mobile allocation indexes frequencies in more than one frequency band then a TBF establishment failure has occurred.

  -	If an IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT or IMMEDIATE PACKET ASSIGNMENT or EC IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT TYPE 1 message indicates a PDCH in a non-supported frequency band then a TBF establishment failure has occurred.

On the network side, if timer T3141 elapses before a successful contention resolution procedure is completed, the newly allocated temporary block flow is released as specified in 3GPP TS 44.060 and the packet access is forgotten.


3.5.2.1.5a	Abnormal cases (EC-CCCH)

If a failure occurs on the mobile station side before a successful contention resolution procedure is completed, the allocated temporary block flow is released; the mobile station returns to packet idle mode, upper layers are notified (TBF establishment failure), and transactions in progress are aborted:

  -	If a TLLI mismatch has occurred during the contention resolution procedure, and the EC PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST message has been sent the maximum number of times as defined by the "EC_Max_Retrans" field broadcast in EC SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 2 message, a TBF establishment failure has occurred.

  -	If the information available in the mobile station, after the reception of an EC IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT TYPE 2 or EC IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT TYPE 4 message indicates a starting uplink timeslot other than timeslot 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4 for a mobile station using CC2, CC3 or CC4 on the uplink, a TBF establishment failure has occurred.

  -	The EC_MA_NUMBER field of the EC Packet Channel Description Type 2 IE (see sub-clause 10.5.2.85) indicates an EC Mobile Allocation set for which resources are not defined (according to the EC SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 1 message) then a TBF establishment failure has occurred.

  -	If an EC IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT TYPE 2 or EC IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT TYPE 4 message indicates a PDCH in a non-supported frequency band then a TBF establishment failure has occurred.

On the network side, if timer T3141 elapses before a successful contention resolution procedure is completed, the newly allocated temporary block flow is released as specified in 3GPP TS 44.060 and the packet access is forgotten.


3.5.2.1.6	(void)


3.5.2.2	Sending an RLC/MAC control message: single block packet access procedure

The sending of an RLC/MAC control message other than the PACKET RESOURCE REQUEST message from a mobile station in packet idle mode to the network may be initiated by the RR entity on the mobile station side using the packet access procedure. If access to the network is allowed (sub-clause 3.5.2.1.1), the packet access is done according to the procedures defined in sub-clauses 3.5.2.1.2 and 3.5.2.1.3, using the single block packet access option defined in sub-clause 3.5.2.1.3.3.

Further action depends on the RLC/MAC control message sent by the mobile station, see 3GPP TS 44.060. Unless otherwise indicated by the RLC/MAC control message, the mobile station remains in packet idle mode.


3.5.2a	Packet access procedure using EC-CCCH

The packet access procedure using EC-CCCH may be used to establish a temporary block flow to support the transfer of LLC PDUs in the direction from the mobile station to the network.

If EC operation is enabled a MS that supports GPRS services using GPRS/EGPRS TBFs may choose to disable EC operation in the serving cell in which case the MS shall perform packet access as described in sub-clause 3.5.2. Similarly, an EC capable mobile station that reselects from a cell that does not support EC-GSM-IoT to a cell that supports EC-GSM-IoT may choose to not enable EC operation in which case it shall perform packet access as described in sub-clause 3.5.2. If EC operation is enabled and a MS performs reselection to a cell that does not support EC-GSM-IoT then it shall perform packet access as described in sub-clause 3.5.2.

A mobile station in EC operation enables PLMN specific access barring upon reading EC_Access_Control_Class and Exception_Report_Status information corresponding to its selected PLMN within the EC SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 2 message or EC SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 4 message. The mobile station disables PLMN specific access barring upon reading an EC SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 2 message or EC SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 4 message for which EC_Access_Control_Class and Exception_Report_Status information is not included for its selected PLMN. While PLMN specific access barring is enabled for its selected PLMN the mobile station shall perform an EC-GSM-IoT preliminary access barring check before accessing the network (see sub-clause 3.5.2a.1) unless it is attempting system access to perform the Multilateration Timing Advance (MTA) procedure (see sub-clause 3.11 and 3GPP TS 44.031). If the preliminary access barring check is performed and indicates network access is barred then access to the network is not allowed. Otherwise, the mobile station proceeds as described in the remainder of this sub-clause.

A mobile station that is accessing the network when the low priority indicator is set to "MS is configured to NAS signalling low priority" (see 3GPP TS 24.008 [79]) and is not sending an exception report (see sub-clause 9.1.65) and is not accessing the network to perform the Multilateration Timing Advance (MTA) procedure (see sub-clause 3.11 and 3GPP TS 44.031), shall read the Implicit Reject Status (IRS) field, EC-BCCH CHANGE MARK field and RACH Access Control field sent in the EC-SCH INFORMATION message (see Figure 9.1.30c.1 and 3GPP TS 45.002) prior to accessing the network.  If a change of EC-BCCH CHANGE MARK is detected it shall read one or more EC-SYSTEM INFORMATION messages as needed (see sub-clause3.10.4). The MS then proceeds as follows:

  -	If the IRS field indicates the access attempt is rejected the mobile station shall abort the packet access procedure and initiate the EC Implicit Reject procedure (see sub-clause 3.5.2a.2).

  -	If the IRS field indicates the access attempt is not rejected, the RACH Access Control field indicates that RACH usage on timeslot number 0 is not allowed it shall proceed with the packet access procedure as decribed in sub-clause 3.5.2.1.2a.

  -	If the IRS field indicates the access attempt is not rejected, the RACH Access Control field indicates that RACH usage on timeslot number 0  is allowed and the mobile station has selected CC1 in both uplink and downlink, see 3GPP TS 45.008 [34], it shall proceed with the packet access procedure as decribed in sub-clause 3.5.2.1.2.

  -	If the IRS field indicates the access attempt is not rejected and the mobile station has selected CC2, CC3 or CC4 in the uplink and/or downlink (see 3GPP TS 45.008 [34]) then it shall proceed with the packet access procedure as decribed in sub-clause 3.5.2.1.2a.

A mobile station that is accessing the network when the low priority indicator is set to "MS is not configured for NAS signalling low priority" or is sending an exception report when the low priority indicator is set to "MS is configured to NAS signalling low priority" and is configured for dual priority (see 3GPP TS 24.008[79]) or is accessing the network to perform the radio access part of a MTA procedure, shall examine the EC-BCCH CHANGE MARK field and RACH Access Control field sent in the EC-SCH INFORMATION message. If a change of EC-BCCH CHANGE MARK is detected it shall read one or more EC SYSTEM INFORMATION messages as needed (see clause 3.10.4) and then proceed as follows:

  -	If the RACH Access Control field indicates that RACH usage is allowed and the mobile station has selected CC1 in both the uplink and downlink it shall proceed with the packet access procedure using the RACH on timeslot 0 (see sub-clause 3.5.2.1.2).

  -	Otherwise, it shall proceed with the packet access procedure as described in sub-clause 3.5.2.1.2a.


3.5.2a.1	EC-GSM-IoT Preliminary Access Barring Check

The EC-GSM-IoT preliminary access barring check shall indicate network access is barred for a MS that has enabled EC operation if any of the following conditions are satisfied:

  -	A MS that is a member of an Access Class in the range 0-9 and is attempting to send a normal report (see sub-clause 9.1.65) shall read the corresponding AC0 to AC9 bit in the EC_Access_Control_Class field sent in the EC SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 2 message (for the common PLMN) or in the EC SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 4 message (for the corresponding Additional PLMN when network sharing is in use in the cell). The MS determines it is not authorized based on the current value of the AC0 to AC9 bit.

  -	A MS that is a member of an Access Class in the range 0-9 and is attempting to send an exception report (see sub-clause 9.1.65) shall read the corresponding Exception_Report_Status field sent in the EC SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 2 message (for the common PLMN) or in the EC SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 4 message (for the corresponding Additional PLMN when network sharing is in use in the cell). The MS determines it is not authorized based on the current value of the Exception_Report_Status bit.

  -	A MS that is a member of one or more of a special Access Class in the range 11-15 and is attempting to send a normal report or an exception report shall read the corresponding AC11 to AC15 bit in the EC_Access_Control_Class field corresponding to its special Access Class sent in the EC SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 2 message (for the common PLMN) or in the EC SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 4 message (for the corresponding Additional PLMN when network sharing is in use in the cell). The MS determines it is not authorized based on the current value of the AC11 to AC15 bit.

If none of the conditions above are fulfilled, the EC-GSM-IoT preliminary access barring check shall indicate network access is not barred.


3.5.2a.2	EC-GSM-IoT Implicit Reject procedure

A mobile station for which timer T3146 is running shall proceed as follows:

  -	While T3146 is running, the mobile station listens to the downlink EC-CCCH for a response from the network and is not allowed to make a new access attempt.

  -	If a response corresponding to its last transmitted EC PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST messages is received the mobile station shall stop T3146 and act on that message as decribed in sub-clause 3.5.2.1.3.

  -	If T3146 expires the mobile station proceeds according to the remainder of this sub-clause.

The mobile station initiates timer T3236, returns to idle mode and monitors the EC-CCCH. The mobile station is not allowed to make a mobile originated access attempt in the same cell until T3236 expires or is stopped unless it is accessing the network when the low priority indicator is set to "MS is not configured for NAS signalling low priority" or is sending an exception report when the low priority indicator is set to "MS is configured to NAS signalling low priority" and is configured for dual priority (see 3GPP TS 24.008[79]).

If the mobile station receives an EC PAGING REQUEST message while T3236 is running it shall stop T3236 and respond to the EC PAGING REQUEST message.


3.5.3	Packet downlink assignment procedure using CCCH

The packet downlink assignment procedure using CCCH may be used to establish a temporary block flow to support the transfer of LLC PDUs in the direction from the network to the mobile station.

This procedure may also be used to assign a single downlink block on a PDCH to support the transfer of an RLC/MAC control message from the network to a mobile station in packet idle mode, see sub-clause 3.5.3.2.


3.5.3.1	Entering the packet transfer mode: packet downlink assignment procedure

The establishment of a downlink temporary block flow may be initiated by the RR entity on the network side using the packet downlink assignment procedure. The procedure is triggered by a request from upper layers to transfer a LLC PDU, see 3GPP TS 24.007. The request from upper layers specifies an optional Priority level, a QoS profile including the requested RLC mode, optional DRX parameters, and optional IMSI and an optional MS Radio Access Capability associated with the packet transfer. The BSS may order its preferred RLC mode independently of the RLC mode signalled from upper layers. If the mobile station supports RLC non-persistent mode the network may allocate an EGPRS TBF that uses this RLC mode.

Upon such a request, the network shall determine whether the mobile station is in packet idle mode or packet transfer mode. The packet downlink assignment procedure using CCCH is applicable when the mobile station is in packet idle mode and when there is no PCCCH present in the cell.

The network may allocate a temporary flow identity and assign a packet downlink resource comprising one PDCH for a downlink temporary block flow.


3.5.3.1.2	Initiation of the packet downlink assignment procedure

The network initiates the packet downlink assignment procedure by sending an IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT or IMMEDIATE PACKET ASSIGNMENT message (if supported) in unacknowledged mode on the CCCH timeslot corresponding to CCCH group the mobile station belongs to. The appropriate CCCH group is calculated from the IMSI, see 3GPP TS 45.002. The behaviour of the network when the RR entity does not receive the IMSI from the upper layers is implementation dependent for the calculation of the CCCH group where the IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT or IMMEDIATE PACKET ASSIGNMENT message has to be sent. If the mobile station is in non-DRX mode or if the RR entity does not receive the IMSI or the DRX parameters from the upper layers, there is no further restriction on what part of the downlink CCCH timeslot the IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT, or IMMEDIATE PACKET ASSIGNMENT message, or the first part of the IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT message (in the case of a two-message assignment), can be sent. If the mobile station applies DRX, the IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT, or IMMEDIATE PACKET ASSIGNMENT message, or the first part of the IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT message (in the case of a two-message assignment), shall be sent in a CCCH block corresponding to a paging group determined for the mobile station in packet idle mode, see 3GPP TS 45.002. If the mobile station has negotiated the use of eDRX, the IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT or IMMEDIATE PACKET ASSIGNMENT message shall be sent in a CCCH block corresponding to a paging group determined for the mobile station in packet idle mode according to the lowest eDRX cycle, see 3GPP TS 45.002.

The IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT message contains:

  -	the packet channel description;

  -	the initial timing advance;

  -	the packet downlink assignment construction.

The contents of the packet downlink assignment construction determines the further action. At the establishment of a downlink temporary block flow, the packet downlink assignment construction shall contain:

  -	the TLLI;

  -	the temporary flow identity;

  -	the RLC mode;

  -	the power control parameters;

  -	the polling bit;

  -	the initial timing advance validity flag;

  -	optionally, EGPRS Window Size (see 3GPP TS 44.060) and Link Quality Measurement Mode (see 3GPP TS 44.060);

  -	optionally, the timing advance index (see 3GPP TS 45.010);

  -	optionally, the TBF starting time;

  -	optionally, the NPM Transfer Time (see 3GPP TS 44.060);

  -	optionally, the Event-Based FANR indication (see 3GPP TS 44.060);

  -	optionally, the TTI Configuration (see 3GPP TS 44.060).

At the establishment of a downlink temporary block flow for MS supporting IMMEDIATE PACKET ASSIGNMENT message, the IPA Downlink Assignment struct sent in IMMEDIATE PACKET ASSIGNMENT message may assign packet downlink resources for multiple mobile stations and contains the following parameters specific to different mobile stations:

  -	the TLLI;

  -	the temporary flow identity;

  -	the power control parameters;

  -	optionally, the timing advance value.

In addition, the IPA Downlink Assignment struct also contains the following parameters which are common to all mobile stations addressed in this structure:

  -	the timeslot number;

  -	optionally the link quality measurement mode;

  -	the RLC mode;

  -	the frequency parameters;

Relevant default values shall be used for the RLC window size and Alpha parameters as specified in in subclause 10.5.2.78.

If frequency hopping is applied, the network may use the indirect encoding or the direct encoding of the frequency configuration in the Packet Channel Description information element in IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT message or in IPA Downlink Assignment struct in IMMEDIATE PACKET ASSIGNMENT message. If the indirect encoding is used, the mobile station uses information received in system information or stored from a previous assignment to determine the frequency parameters, see 3GPP TS 44.060. If the direct encoding is used, the mobile station uses the cell allocation defined for the cell to decode the mobile allocation.

If the BSS receives a DL-UNITDATA PDU that includes eDRX information but excludes coverage class information (i.e. the corresponding mobile station has enabled PEO) and that indicates timing advance information is needed (see 3GPP TS 48.018) it sends an IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT or IMMEDIATE PACKET ASSIGNMENT message to the mobile station that indicates timing advance information is needed (see sub-clause 10.5.2.16 and sub-clause 10.5.2.78).

If the indirect encoding is used, the IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT or the IMMEDIATE PACKET ASSIGNMENT message may contain a CHANGE_MARK_1 field. If that is present, the mobile station shall verify the validity of the SI change mark associated with the GPRS mobile allocation to which the message refers, see 3GPP TS 44.060. If the CHANGE_MARK_1 field and the SI change mark do not match, the message does not satisfactorily define a PDCH.

If the mobile station receives an IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT message and the Dedicated mode or TBF information element indicates that this is the first message in a two-message assignment, the mobile station shall start listen to the full CCCH. The network may send a second IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT message to the mobile station within two multiframe periods following the first IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT message, specifying the packet channel description and, if required, a mobile allocation for the assignment. The two IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT messages in a two-message assignment shall have the same contents of the Request Reference information elements.

If the mobile station was operating in DRX mode when it received the first message of a two-message assignment, the network shall not send the second IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT message within the two block periods immediately following the first message.

If the mobile station does not receive the second IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT messages in a two-message assignment within two multiframe periods following the first message, the mobile station shall discard the first IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT message received. After the two multiframe periods following the first message, the mobile station may resume to DRX mode.

On receipt of an IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT or IMMEDIATE PACKET ASSIGNMENT message or, in case of a two-message assignment, a matching pair of IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT messages, the mobile station stops monitoring downlink CCCH and switches to the assigned PDCH and starts listening for downlink RLC/MAC blocks identified by the assigned TFI; it starts timer T3190.

The IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT message may indicate a TBF starting time. If the mobile station receives the message before the TBF starting time has expired, it shall wait until the frame number indicated by the TBF starting time, start timer T3190 and switch to the assigned PDCH. If the mobile station receives the message after the TBF starting time has expired, it shall ignore the indicated TBF starting time, immediately start timer T3190 and switch to the assigned PDCH.

When the mobile station switches to the assigned PDCH, it shall take the power control parameters received in the IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT or the IMMEDIATE PACKET ASSIGNMENT message into account, perform signal strength measurements and apply output power control procedures as they are defined for packet transfer mode, see 3GPP TS 45.008.

If the Polling bit is set to 1, MS shall send a PACKET CONTROL ACKNOWLEDGEMENT message (see 44.060) on the assigned PDCH, in the uplink block specified by the TBF Starting Time. In this case the TBF Starting Time is used both to indicate when the assigned PDCH becomes valid and to specify the uplink block. If the TBF Starting Time is not present or has expired, the MS shall ignore the polling request.

An IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT message may indicate a timing advance index (TAI) in the packet timing advance IE. The mobile station shall then use the continuous update timing advance mechanism, see 3GPP TS 45.010, using PTCCH in the same timeslot as the assigned PDCH. If there is no indication of a timing advance index, the continuous update timing advance mechanism shall not be used.

The TA_VALID flag indicates if the value of the Timing Advance IE is valid or not.

If the network does not have a valid timing advance value for the mobile station to include in the IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT or the IMMEDIATE PACKET ASSIGNMENT message, the network shall use the procedures defined in 3GPP TS 44.060 on the assigned TBF, or the polling mechanism defined in the above paragraph if the PACKET CONTROL ACKNOWLEDGEMENT format is set to four access bursts, to obtain a timing advance value and to update the initially assigned timing advance value before the mobile station is required to transmit other than access burst on the newly assigned channel.

The packet downlink construction may optionally contain the EGPRS Window Size (see 3GPP TS 44.060) and Link Quality Measurement Mode (see 3GPP TS 44.060). The presence of these fields indicates EGPRS TBF mode (see 3GPP TS 44.060). If these fields are not present, this indicates GPRS TBF mode.


3.5.3.1.3	Packet downlink assignment completion

After having sent the packet downlink assignment, the network starts sending downlink RLC/MAC blocks on the assigned packet downlink resource and the packet downlink assignment procedure is completed at the network side.

On the mobile station side, the procedure is completed when the mobile station receives an RLC/MAC block identified by the assigned temporary flow identity. The mobile station stops timer T3190. The mobile station has entered packet transfer mode.


3.5.3.1.4	Abnormal cases

If a failure occurs on the mobile station side before the packet downlink assignment procedure is completed (TBF establishment failure), the temporary block flow is released; the mobile station returns to packet idle mode:

  -	If the mobile station does not receive a RLC/MAC block on the assigned PDCHs before timer T3190 expires, then a TBF establishment failure has occurred.

  -	If the information available in the mobile station, after the reception of an IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT or IMMEDIATE PACKET ASSIGNMENT message or the second IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT message of a two-message assignment, does not satisfactorily define a PDCH, then a TBF establishment failure has occurred.

  -	If the mobile allocation in the frequency parameters indexes frequencies in more than one frequency band, then a TBF establishment failure has occurred.

If an IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT or IMMEDIATE PACKET ASSIGNMENTmessage indicates a PDCH in a non-supported frequency band, then a TBF establishment failure has occurred.


3.5.3.2	Sending an RLC/MAC control message: single block packet downlink assignment procedure

The sending of an RLC/MAC control message to a mobile station in packet idle mode may be initiated by the RR entity on network side using the packet downlink assignment procedure. The procedure is used to assign a single downlink block on a PDCH for the transfer of the RLC/MAC control message. Using this procedure, the network shall not apply segmentation of the RLC/MAC control message.

The single downlink block assignment is done according to the procedure defined in sub-clause 3.5.3.1.2, with the following exceptions:

The packet downlink assignment construction in the IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT message shall contain only:

  -	the TLLI; and

  -	the TBF starting time.

If the mobile station receives the IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT message before the TBF starting time has expired, it shall wait until the frame number indicated by the TBF starting time. The network shall use the TBF starting time to indicate the first frame number belonging to the single block period assigned to the mobile station. The mobile station shall switch to the assigned PDCH and attempt to decode an RLC/MAC control message in the assigned downlink block. Further action depends on the RLC/MAC control message sent by the network, see 3GPP TS 44.060. Unless otherwise indicated by the RLC/MAC control message, the mobile station remains in packet idle mode. If the mobile station remains in packet idle mode, it shall continue to monitor downlink CCCH once the block period indicated by the TBF starting time has passed.

If the mobile station fails to decode or does not receive an RLC/MAC control message in the assigned downlink block, it shall remain in packet idle mode and continue to monitor downlink CCCH once the block period indicated by the TBF starting time has passed.

If the mobile station receives the IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT message after the TBF starting time has expired, it shall ignore the assignment.

If a failure occurs on the mobile station side due to any other reason, the mobile station shall ignore the assignment.


3.5.3.2a	Sending an RLC/MAC control message: multiple blocks packet downlink assignment procedure

The sending of an RLC/MAC control message to a mobile station in packet idle mode may be initiated by the RR entity on network side using the packet downlink assignment procedure. The procedure is used to assign multiple downlink blocks on a PDCH for the transfer of the RLC/MAC control message. Using this procedure, the network may apply segmentation of the RLC/MAC control message.

The multiple downlink blocks assignment is done according to the procedure defined in sub-clause 3.5.3.1.2, with the following exceptions:

The multiple blocks packet downlink assignment construction in the IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT message shall contain only:

  -	the TBF starting time;

  -	the number of allocated blocks;

  -	optionally, the TMGI;

  -	optionally, the MBMS session identity;

  -	optionally, the TLLI / G-RNTI;

  -	optionally, the MS_ID and packet timing advance parameters.

If the message contains the TLLI / G-RNTI not addressing the mobile station, the message shall be ignored.

If the mobile station receives the IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT message before the TBF starting time has expired, it shall wait until the frame number indicated by the TBF starting time. The network shall use the TBF starting time to indicate the first frame number belonging to the multiple block period assigned to the mobile station. The mobile station shall switch to the assigned PDCH and attempt to decode an RLC/MAC control message in the assigned downlink block(s). Further action depends on the RLC/MAC control message sent by the network, see 3GPP TS 44.060. Unless otherwise indicated by the RLC/MAC control message, the mobile station remains in packet idle mode. If the mobile station remains in packet idle mode, it shall continue to monitor downlink CCCH.

If the mobile station fails to decode or does not receive an RLC/MAC control message in the assigned downlink block(s), it shall remain in packet idle mode and continue to monitor downlink CCCH.

If the mobile station receives the IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT message after the TBF starting time has expired, it shall ignore the assignment.

If a failure occurs on the mobile station side due to any other reason, the mobile station shall ignore the assignment.


3.5.4	MBMS packet access procedure using CCCH


3.5.4.1	General

If access to the network is allowed (sub-clause 3.5.2.1.1), the MBMS packet access is done according to the procedures defined in sub-clauses 3.5.2.1.2 and 3.5.2.1.3, using the single block MBMS access option.

The initiation of the MBMS packet access procedure is defined in 3GPP TS 44.060.

A mobile station shall continue to monitor its paging subchannel on CCCH for PAGING REQUEST messages indicating an establishment of RR connection or a packet paging procedure during the MBMS packet access procedure. A mobile station shall abort the MBMS packet access procedure at the receipt of a PAGING REQUEST message indicating an establishment of RR connection or a packet paging procedure.


3.5.4.2	On receipt of a CHANNEL REQUEST message

On receipt of a CHANNEL REQUEST message with access type indicating "Single block MBMS access", the network shall grant only the single block period on the assigned packet uplink resource if the network allocates resource for the mobile station.

The packet uplink resource is assigned to the mobile station in an IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT message sent in unacknowledged mode on the same CCCH timeslot on which the network has received the CHANNEL REQUEST message. The packet uplink resource description shall contain:

  -	the power control parameter setting;

  -	the TBF starting time.

If uplink resources are not available, the network may reject the access request by sending a IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT REJECT message (see sub-clause 3.5.4.4).


3.5.4.3	On receipt of an IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT message

If the mobile station receives the IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT message or, in case of a two-message assignment, a matching pair of IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT messages corresponding to one of its 3 last CHANNEL REQUEST messages, before the TBF starting time has expired, the mobile station shall wait until the block period indicated by the TBF starting time. The network shall use the TBF starting time to indicate the first frame number belonging to the single block period granted for packet access. The mobile station may use the assigned block period to send an MBMS SERVICE REQUEST message, as defined in 3GPP TS 44.060.

If the mobile station receives the IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT message after the TBF starting time has expired, a failure has occurred and the mobile station proceeds as specified in sub-clause 3.5.4.6.

While timer T3214 is running the mobile shall accept reception of repeated IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT messages, on the same CCCH timeslot on which the mobile station has sent the CHANNEL REQUEST message, and re-send the MBMS SERVICE REQUEST message, as defined in 3GPP TS 44.060.


3.5.4.4	On receipt of an IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT REJECT message

The network may send an IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT REJECT message to the mobile station in response to the CHANNEL REQUEST message. The mobile station shall then react according to the description in sub-clause 3.3.1.1.3.2.


3.5.4.5	On receipt of an MBMS ASSIGNMENT message

The MBMS assignment procedure using CCCH may be used in order to assign the radio bearer resources for an MBMS session in the cell or to notify the mobile station(s) that a radio bearer for that MBMS session is not established in the cell.

The assignment for the MBMS session is done by using the multiple blocks packet downlink assignment procedure (non-distribution or distribution MBMS assignment) as specified in the sub-clause 3.5.3.2a.

When the mobile station receives an MBMS ASSIGNMENT message for an MBMS session, it shall stop any ongoing packet access procedure for that MBMS session and proceed as defined in 3GPP TS 44.060.


3.5.4.6	Abnormal cases

If the mobile station receives an IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT message that contains faulty parameters, the mobile station shall abort the MBMS access procedure.


3.5.5	Packet downlink assignment procedure using EC-CCCH

The packet downlink assignment procedure using EC-CCCH may be used to establish a temporary block flow to support the transfer of LLC PDUs in the direction from the network to the mobile station when the mobile station has enabled EC operation.


3.5.5.1	Entering the packet transfer mode: packet downlink assignment procedure

The establishment of a downlink temporary block flow may be initiated by the RR entity on the network side using the packet downlink assignment procedure. The procedure is triggered by a request from upper layers to transfer a LLC PDU, see 3GPP TS 24.007. The request from upper layers specifies an optional Priority level, eDRX cycle, a downlink coverage class, P-TMSI, IMSI and an optional MS Radio Access Capability associated with the packet transfer.

Upon such a request, the network shall determine whether the mobile station is in packet idle mode or packet transfer mode. The packet downlink assignment procedure using EC-CCCH is applicable when the mobile station is in packet idle mode and the corresponding Ready timer is running.

The network may allocate a temporary flow identity and assign a packet downlink resource comprising one PDCH (for a mobile station using CC1 on the downlink) or 4 PDCHs (for a mobile station using CC2, CC3 or CC4 on the downlink) for a downlink temporary block flow. The uplink EC-PACCH corresponding to the downlink temporary block flow is also assigned by the network, comprising one PDCH (when CC1 assigned on the uplink) or 4 PDCHs (when CC2, CC3 or CC4 assigned on the uplink).


3.5.5.2	Initiation of the packet downlink assignment procedure

When the Ready timer is running the network initiates the packet downlink assignment procedure by sending an EC DOWNLINK ASSIGNMENT message (see sub-clause 9.1.64) or EC DOWNLINK ASSIGNMENT TYPE 2 (see sub-clause 9.1.67) in unacknowledged mode using the paging group determined using IMSI, the lowest eDRX cycle and the downlink coverage class of the mobile station (see 3GPP TS 45.002). The downlink coverage class information last transmitted to the network for a given mobile station is provided to the BSS in a DL-UNITDATA PDU (see 3GPP TS 48.018 [107]) sent for that mobile station.

The EC DOWNLINK ASSIGNMENT message or EC DOWNLINK ASSIGNMENT TYPE 2 contains:

  -	the temporary flow identity;

  -	the EGPRS modulation and coding scheme for RLC data blocks;

  -	the power control parameters;

  -	optionally, the initial timing advance;

  -	the packet resources used for the downlink TBF;

  -	the downlink Coverage Class used to send the message;

  -	the EC_MA_NUMBER;

  -	an indication of the uplink and downlink coverage class the MS is to use on the assigned packet resources;

  -	an indication of the quarter hyperframe used to send the EC DOWNLINK ASSIGNMENT message.

The EC_MA_NUMBER field of the EC Packet Channel Description Type 2 IE (see sub-clause 10.5.2.85) indicates the mobile allocation to be used.

When a BSS receives a DL-UNITDATA PDU that includes both Coverage Class and eDRX information it sends an assignment message on the EC-AGCH (associated with the EC-PCH of its EC_CCCH_GROUP) using the indicated downlink Coverage Class and the lowest eDRX cycle (see 3GPP TS 45.002 [48]).

When a BSS receives a DL-UNITDATA PDU that does not include Coverage Class information but includes eDRX information it sends an assignment message on the AGCH (associated with the PCH of its CCCH_GROUP) using the lowest eDRX cycle (see 3GPP TS 45.002 [48]).

If the BSS receives a DL-UNITDATA PDU that includes coverage class information (i.e. the corresponding mobile station has enabled EC-GSM-IoT operation) and that indicates timing advance information is needed (see 3GPP TS 48.018) it sends an EC DOWNLINK ASSIGNMENT message to the mobile station that includes this indication (see sub-clause 9.1.64).

On receipt of an EC DOWNLINK ASSIGNMENT message (see sub-clause 9.1.64) or EC DOWNLINK ASSIGNMENT TYPE 2 message the mobile station stops monitoring downlink EC-CCCH, switches to the assigned PDCH(s), starts listening for downlink RLC/MAC blocks identified by the assigned TFI and starts timer T3190. See 3GPP TS 45.010 [35] for mobile station reaction time requirements applicable to receiving an assignment message.

When the mobile station switches to the assigned PDCH(s), it shall take the power control parameters received in the EC DOWNLINK ASSIGNMENT or EC DOWNLINK ASSIGNMENT TYPE 2 message into account, perform signal strength measurements and apply output power control procedures as they are defined for packet transfer mode, see 3GPP TS 45.008.


3.5.5.3	Packet downlink assignment completion

After having sent the packet downlink assignment, the network starts sending downlink RLC/MAC blocks on the assigned packet downlink resource and the packet downlink assignment procedure is completed at the network side.

On the mobile station side, the procedure is completed when the mobile station receives an RLC/MAC block identified by the assigned temporary flow identity. The mobile station stops timer T3190. The mobile station has entered packet transfer mode.


3.5.5.4	Abnormal cases

If a failure occurs on the mobile station side before the packet downlink assignment procedure is completed (TBF establishment failure), the temporary block flow is released; the mobile station returns to packet idle mode:

  -	If the mobile station does not receive a RLC/MAC block on the assigned PDCHs before timer T3190 expires, then a TBF establishment failure has occurred.

  -	If the information available in the mobile station, after the reception of an EC DOWNLINK ASSIGNMENT message or EC DOWNLINK ASSIGNMENT TYPE 2, does not satisfactorily define a PDCH, then a TBF establishment failure has occurred.



3.6	RR Procedures in packet transfer mode


3.6.1	RR Connection establishment using enhanced DTM CS establishment

The initiation of the procedure and the assignment of resources for the establishment of the RR connection are described in 3GPP TS 44.060.

In respect of the establishment of the RR connection, the mobile station shall act on the starting time information element, if present in an IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT message, as specified in sub-clause 3.3.1.1.3.1.

The establishment of the main signalling link is described in sub-clause 3.1.5. In the case of a network initiated establishment (i.e. not following the sending of a PACKET CS REQUEST message), the layer 2 SABM frame shall contain a PAGING RESPONSE message. Otherwise (i.e. the mobile station has sent a PACKET CS REQUEST message), an appropriate layer 3 service request message shall be sent in the layer 2 SABM frame.

The completion of the establishment of the RR connection is described in sub-clause 3.6.2.


3.6.2	Completion of RR Connection establishment


3.6.2.1	Connection established in response to an encapsulated IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT message

The RR connection establishment procedure is terminated on the network side when the main signalling link is established. Timer T3101 is stopped, the MM sublayer on the network side is informed that the RR entity has entered the dedicated mode and the network may release the old packet resources.

On the mobile station side, the procedure is terminated when the establishment of the main signalling link is confirmed. The MM sublayer is informed that the RR entity has entered the dedicated mode.


3.6.2.2	Connection established in response to an encapsulated DTM ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message

For the handling of the packet resources upon reception of the encapsulated DTM ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message the sub-clauses 3.4.23.2.2 and 3.4.23.2.3 are applicable.

The RR connection establishment procedure is terminated on the network side when the main signalling link is established. Timer T3107 is stopped, the MM sublayer on the network side is informed that the RR entity has entered the dual transfer mode, and the network may release the old packet resources.

On the mobile station side, the procedure is terminated when the establishment of the main signalling link is confirmed. The MM sublayer is informed that the RR entity has entered the dual transfer mode.


3.7	DTM Handover procedure


3.7.1	General

In dual transfer mode an intercell change of dedicated and packet data channel(s) can be requested by the network RR sublayer. This change may be performed using the DTM handover procedure.

This procedure is optional and is only applicable in dual transfer mode when both the mobile station and the network support DTM handover. The mobile station shall indicate its support for DTM handover in the Mobile Station Classmark 3 IE and the MS Radio Access Capability IE. The purpose of the procedure is to handover the dedicated channel and one or more of the packet resources while in dual transfer mode when a cell is changed. The DTM handover procedure is a combination of the handover procedure for circuit switched handover, defined in sub-clause 3.4.4, and the procedure for packet switched handover, defined in 3GPP TS 44.060.

  NOTE:	The decision to initiate a DTM handover and the choice of the new cell is out of the scope of this technical specification.

The DTM handover procedure is always initiated by the network.


3.7.2	DTM Handover from GERAN A/Gb mode to GERAN A/Gb mode procedure

The DTM handover procedure includes:

  -	The suspension of normal operation except for RR management (layer 3).

  -	The disconnection of the main signalling link, and of the other links via local end release (layer 2), and the disconnection of the TCH.

  -	The mobile station suspension of the packet resources used in the old cell (see 3GPP TS 44.060) until the MS determines the DTM handover procedure to be successfully completed at which point these packet resources are released.

  -	The mobile station disconnection and deactivation of the dedicated channel used in the old cell (see 3GPP TS 44.018) until the MS determines the DTM handover procedure to be successfully completed at which point the dedicated channel is released (at layer 1).

  -	The activation of the new channels, and their connection if applicable.

  -	The triggering of the establishment of data link connection for SAPI = 0 on the new channels.

  -	The activation of the new PDCH(s) and the resumption of the packet resources (see 3GPP TS 44.060).

For the circuit switched domain the requirements and procedures listed in sub-clauses 3.4.4.1, 3.4.4.2 and 3.4.4.3 are valid with the following exceptions:

  -	Handover of VGCS is not supported by the DTM handover procedure.

  -	MBMS service information sending completion is not supported by the DTM handover procedure.

  -	The DTM HANDOVER COMMAND message applies instead of the HANDOVER COMMAND message and is sent on the PACCH (see 3GPP TS 44.060).

  -	Sending of DTM Information is not needed.

For the packet switched domain the requirements and procedures described for PS handover in 3GPP TS 44.060 are valid with the following exceptions:

  -	The synchronisation of the physical channels is not performed in the PS domain, i.e. the mobile station shall not send the PS HANDOVER ACCESS message.

  -	The target BSS considers the DTM handover procedure to be successfully completed upon receiving a HANDOVER COMPLETE message on the main DCCH according to sub-clause 3.4.4.3.

  -	Timer T3216 shall not be started for DTM handover.

  -	The DTM HANDOVER COMMAND message applies instead of the PS HANDOVER COMMAND message.


3.7.2.1	Abnormal cases

The failure cases and actions defined in sub-clause 3.4.4.4, shall apply for DTM handover from GERAN A/Gb mode to GERAN A/Gb mode with the following exceptions:

  -	The DTM HANDOVER COMMAND message applies instead of the HANDOVER COMMAND message and is sent on the PACCH.

In addition, a mobile station operating in A/Gb mode shall consider the DTM handover to A/Gb mode to have failed if the DTM HANDOVER COMMAND message:

  a)	violates the mobile station’s DTM multislot capabilities; or

  b)	does not include at least one uplink TBF; or

  c)	provides one or more downlink TBFs with PFIs that are different from those currently allocated; or

  d)	provides one or more uplink TBFs with PFIs that are different from those currently allocated except when there are no ongoing uplink TBFs in which case a single uplink TBF with a PFI that indicates signalling shall be allocated.

If these additional error cases occur, the mobile station shall remain in DTM in the old cell and return a HANDOVER FAILURE message on the current main DCCH with the PS Cause IE set as follows:

  -	in case a) above, "DTM multislot capabilities violated"; or

  -	in case b) above, "No uplink TBF"; or

  -	in case c) above, "Too many TBFs"; or

  -	in case d) above, "Too many TBFs".

If there are no errors in the DTM HANDOVER COMMAND message related to the CS domain and there are no common errors then the RR Cause IE shall indicate "Normal Event". Any error that is common to both the CS domain and the PS domain shall be reported in the RR Cause IE.

The transmission of a HANDOVER FAILURE message terminates the DTM handover procedure in the mobile station.

After terminating the DTM handover procedure the mobile station shall resume all uplink and downlink TBFs that were ongoing in the old cell prior to receiving the DTM HANDOVER COMMAND message and for which T3180 (uplink TBFs) and T3190 (downlink TBFs) are still running (see 3GPP TS 44.060).

For each TBF that is resumed the corresponding RLC state machine shall reflect its state when the last RLC data block was transmitted for that TBF in the old cell (uplink TBFs) and the last RLC data block was received for that TBF in the old cell (downlink TBFs) (see 3GPP TS 44.060).


3.7.3	DTM Handover from GERAN A/Gb mode to UTRAN procedure

For the successful case of DTM Handover from GERAN A/Gb mode to UTRAN, the behaviour of the MS in the old cell is as specified for DTM Handover from GERAN A/Gb mode to GERAN A/Gb mode (see sub-clause 3.7.2). The behaviour of the MS in the new cell is as specified for Inter-RAT Handover to UTRAN in 3GPP TS 25.331. The behaviour of the old BSS is as specified in sub-clause 3.7.2.

The definition of abnormal cases for the mobile is specified in 3GPP TS 25.331. If the UE/MS receives a HANDOVER TO UTRAN COMMAND message, which contains a protocol error causing the variable PROTOCOL_ERROR_REJECT to be set to TRUE (see 3GPP TS 25.331), the MS sends a HANDOVER FAILURE message on the main DCCH to the old cell. The appropriate cause shall be included (see sub-clause 3.4.4a.3).

The definition of abnormal cases for the old BSS and the behaviour of the old BSS in such cases (including on receipt of a HANDOVER FAILURE) is as specified in sub-clause 3.7.2.1.


3.8	Network sharing


3.8.1	General

A network supporting network sharing shall broadcast network sharing information indicating the core network operators sharing the Radio Access Network (see sub-clause 3.8.2;

Additionally, in a cell where network sharing information is broadcast in SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 22 message, the network:

  -	shall broadcast network sharing information indicating the core network operators sharing the Radio Access Network;

  -	shall configure the contents of the SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 5/5bis/5ter and SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 6 messages to indicate the selected PLMN when the mobile station supports network sharing;

  -	may broadcast domain-specific access control information. Only networks and mobile stations supporting network sharing may support domain-specific access control.

  -	may broadcast when applicable PLMN-specific UTRAN and/or E-UTRAN information for inter-RAT cell re-selection.

A mobile station supporting network sharing shall use this information for PLMN (re)selection, cell reselection, E-UTRAN measurement reporting and to determine whether or not access to the network is allowed, possibly on a domain (CS or PS) basis.

A mobile station that has enabled EC operation shall use the network sharing information (if broadcast in the cell) for PLMN (re-)selection, cell reselection and to determine whether or not access to the network is allowed, see sub-clause 3.8.3.2.

  NOTE:	In a network supporting network sharing, a mobile station not supporting network sharing may reselect cells of other RATs not belonging to an equivalent PLMN of the registered PLMN. Setting different priorities for frequencies belonging to different PLMNs but in the same RAT may favour one PLMN over the other in areas shared by these PLMNs.


3.8.2	Network side


3.8.2.1	Provision of network sharing information

A cell where network sharing is supported shall broadcast the SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 22 message in which it shall indicate:

  -	whether or not mobile stations supporting network sharing are allowed to select the Common PLMN; and

  -	the PLMN ID (MCC and MNC) of up to four Additional PLMNs; and

  -	the permitted NCCs for cell (re)selection and measurement reporting corresponding to each of the up to four Additional PLMNs.

Additionally and individually for each of the up to four Additional PLMNs SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 22 may indicate the applicable access control information to be used for accessing the network (see sub-clauses 3.3.1.1.1, 3.5.2.1.1).

The network may also indicate in the SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 21 message access control information for EAB used for the preliminary access barring check (see sub-clause 3.3.1.4) individually for each of the up to four Additional PLMNs.

If domain-specific access control is used for a PLMN (Common PLMN and/or any of the up to four Additional PLMNs), the network shall include the corresponding information in the SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 22 message and SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 21 message as applicable.

The network may include PLMN-specific UTRAN and/or E-UTRAN information for inter-RAT cell re-selection purpose in the SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 23 message. When the SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 23 message is broadcast, the network shall broadcast the UTRAN and/or E-UTRAN information for inter-RAT cell re-selection related to a given PLMN in consecutive instances of the SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 23 message.

  NOTE:	So as to take into account the monitoring capabilities (see 3GPP TS 45.008) of mobile stations not supporting network sharing, the network may provide updates of the UTRAN/E-UTRAN frequencies lists broadcast within the SI2ter/SI2quater messages that are not applicable to mobile stations supporting network sharing (see sub-clause 3.8.3).

The network shall use the PLMN index provided by a mobile station supporting network sharing (see sub-clause 3.8.3) to map it upon the list of PLMN IDs it broadcasts in order to derive the PLMN selected by the mobile station and to route the initial access to the appropriate CN node (see subclause 10.3.1 and 3GPP TS 48.008 for the CS domain, see 3GPP TS 48.018 for the PS domain).

The network shall indicate the selected PLMN when configuring the neighbour cell information included in the SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 5/5bis/5ter messages for a mobile station supporting network sharing.

The network shall indicate the selected PLMN ID when configuring the Location Area Identification IE included in the SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 6 message for a mobile station supporting network sharing. Otherwise, it shall configure the Location Area Identification IE to indicate the common PLMN.


3.8.2.2	EC System information broadcasting

A cell supporting EC-GSM-IoT may broadcast the EC SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 4 message in which it shall indicate:

  -	whether or not the mobile station in EC operation is allowed to select the Common PLMN; and

  -	the PLMN ID (MCC and MNC) of up to four Additional PLMNs; and

  -	the permitted NCCs for cell (re)selection corresponding to each of the up to four Additional PLMNs; and

  -	whether or not sending of exception reports (see sub-clause 9.1.65) is allowed in each of the four Additional PLMNs.

Additionally and individually for each of the up to four Additional PLMNs the EC SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 4 message may indicate the applicable access control information to be used for accessing the network (see sub-clause 3.5.2a.1).

The network shall use the PLMN index provided by the mobile station to map it upon the list of PLMN IDs it broadcasts in order to derive the PLMN selected by the mobile station and to route the initial access to the appropriate CN node (see 3GPP TS 48.018).


3.8.3	Mobile station side

A mobile station supporting network sharing that has not enabled EC operation shall read the SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 22 message if broadcast in the cell and acquire the Network Sharing Information.

The mobile station shall use this information to determine the PLMNs available in this cell for (re)selection, the applicable access control information for the selected PLMN and the allowed NCC for measurement reporting and cell reselection (see 3GPP TS 45.008, 3GPP TS 23.003) for the selected PLMN.

A mobile station that has enabled EC operation shall read the EC SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 4 message if broadcast in the cell and acquire the Network Sharing Information therein. The mobile station shall use this information to determine the PLMNs available in the cell for (re)selection, the applicable access control information for the selected PLMN and the allowed NCC for cell reselection (see 3GPP TS 45.008 [34], 3GPP TS 23.003) for the selected PLMN.

The mobile station shall consider the Common PLMN (only if the Common PLMN is indicated as allowed in the SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 22 message or in the EC SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 4 message) and each indicated Additional PLMN in its PLMN selection process as specified in 3GPP TS 23.122.

Once a PLMN is selected, the mobile station shall only use the information applicable to this PLMN (i.e. PLMN ID, access control information, NCC Permitted) within the serving cell, until it is either modified, becomes invalid or a different PLMN or a new cell is reselected, whichever occurs first. If the applicable information is made invalid in the cell (see sub-clause 3.2.1), the mobile station shall assume network sharing is not used in the cell until it can again determine that network sharing is used.

For the mobile station, "applicable to this PLMN" shall be understood as meaning either "explicitly broadcast within (EC) SYSTEM INFORMATION messages for this PLMN" or "derived by the mobile station using a field explicitly provided by (EC) SYSTEM INFORMATION messages for a PLMN listed previous to its selected PLMN"; using a "previously listed field" means the mobile station attempts to find a PLMN previous to its selected PLMN for which a field of interest is explicitly provided by (EC) SYSTEM INFORMATION messages. The Annex M provides examples of using a "previously listed field".

A UTRAN and/or E-UTRAN capable mobile station supporting network sharing shall also read the SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 23 message if broadcast in the cell, to acquire PLMN-specific UTRAN and/or E-UTRAN information used for inter-RAT cell re-selection.

If so indicated by the SI_CHANGE_ALT field provided in the SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 13 message (see sub-clause 10.5.2.37b), a UTRAN and/or E-UTRAN capable mobile station supporting network sharing shall ignore any change in system information signalled by a SI_CHANGE_FIELD value '2' provided in the same message.

When accessing the network, the mobile station shall indicate the selected PLMN index as follows:

  -	For access to CS domain via Initial Layer 3 message (see 3GPP TS 24.008 and sub-clause 10.3.1).

  -	For access to PS domain via AS signalling (see 3GPP TS 44.060).


3.8.4	Abnormal cases

The mobile station shall ignore any information provided for an Additional PLMN in the SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 22 message or in the EC SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 4 message if this Additional PLMN is the same as the Common PLMN.

If the same Additional PLMN ID is provided more than once in the SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 22 message or in the EC SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 4 message, the mobile station shall use the information corresponding to the first instance of that Additional PLMN.

If the number of Additional PLMNs broadcast in the SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 21 message as part of the EAB Network Sharing Information (see sub-clause 10.5.2.37m) differs from the number of Additional PLMNs broadcast in the SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 22 message as part of the Network Sharing Information (see sub-clause 10.5.2.37n) a mobile station supporting network sharing and configured for EAB shall ignore the EAB Network Sharing Information in the SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 21 message and assume the EAB Authorization Mask and EAB Subcategory information otherwise included in this message applies to all PLMNs in this cell (i.e. Common PLMN and all Additional PLMNs).

If the SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 21 message indicates that EAB is used for an Additional PLMN for which the previously listed EAB Authorization Mask/Subcategory apply, but no corresponding Additional EAB Authorization Mask / Additional EAB Subcategory fields and EAB Authorization Mask / EAB Subcategory fields are provided by the network (see Table 10.5.2.37m.2), the mobile station shall assume that EAB is not used for this Additional PLMN in this cell.

If the SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 21 message indicates that domain-specific access control is used for EAB for an Additional PLMN for which the previously listed EAB Authorization Mask/Subcategory apply, but no corresponding PS EAB Authorization Mask / PS EAB Subcategory fields and Common PS EAB Authorization Mask / Common PS EAB Subcategory fields are provided by the network (see Table 10.5.2.37m.2), the mobile station shall assume that domain-specific access control for EAB is not used for this Additional PLMN in this cell.

If the SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 22 message indicates that domain-specific access control is used for an Additional PLMN for which the previously listed Access Control Class bitmap applies, but no corresponding PS_ACC field and Common_PLMN_PS_ACC field are provided by the network (see Table 10.5.2.37n.2), the mobile station shall assume that domain-specific access control is not used for this Additional PLMN in this cell. If this occurs, this will not preclude a mobile station from using domain-specific access control information for EAB.

If the number of Additional PLMNs broadcast in the SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 23 message as part of the IRAT Cell Reselection Information (see sub-clause 10.5.2.37o) differs from the number of Additional PLMNs broadcast in the SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 22 message as part of the Network Sharing Information (see sub-clause 10.5.2.37n) a mobile station supporting network sharing shall ignore the IRAT Cell reselection Information in the SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 23 message and assume the SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 2ter/2quater messages fully apply to all PLMNs in this cell (i.e. Common PLMN and all Additional PLMNs).


3.9	Power Efficient Operation (PEO)


3.9.1	General

Power Efficient Operation (PEO) is an optional feature used by a MS in a cell that supports PEO to reduce its power consumption through the use of relaxed mobility related requirements (see 3GPP TS 43.064 [109]) and a power saving feature while in idle mode. The power saving feature consists of either extended DRX (eDRX – see 3GPP TS 45.002 [32]) or Power Saving Mode (PSM – see 3GPP TS 23.060 [74]), and a PEO capable mobile station shall support at least one. A cell indicates its support of PEO by including the PEO_DSC field in the SI13 Rest Octets IE.

A PEO capable mobile station camping in a cell that supports PEO performs NAS signalling to negotiate the use of a power saving feature (i.e. eDRX or PSM – see 3GPP TS 23.060 [74]). A mobile station that has enabled PEO (see 3GPP TS 43.064 [109]) shall only transmit an EGPRS PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST message indicating ‘PEO One Phase Access Request’ (see Table 3.5.2.1.2.2 and 3GPP TS 44.060 [76]) when performing system access. A BSS that receives this message shall send a response that only assigns the MS packet resources in the frequency band corresponding to CCCH on which the EGPRS PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST message was received.

When PEO is enabled it shall be disabled in case the MS enters a cell that does not support PEO or the MS decides to disable PEO for any reason.  When PEO is disabled the MS shall continue to use eDRX or PSM (whichever is enabled) as long as it remains in the same Routing Area it was in when it performed NAS signalling to enable eDRX/PSM (i.e. regardless of whether or not the serving cell indicates PEO is enabled). When PEO is disabled the use of relaxed mobility related requirements and the use of the EGPRS PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST message indicating ‘PEO One Phase Access Request’ shall be disabled.  Upon reselecting to a cell in a new Routing Area a mobile station that has enabled eDRX/PSM shall consider it as disabled (i.e. the MS must perform additional NAS signalling in the new Routing Area to enable eDRX/PSM).


3.9.2	PEO Power Saving States

A MS that has enabled PEO where eDRX is used supports eDRX paging cycles that can range from multiple seconds to about 52 minutes (see 3GPP TS 45.002 [32]). In this case the mobile station supports reachability while in packet idle mode as follows:

  -	The mobile station uses the lowest eDRX cycle while the Ready timer (see 3GPP TS 24.008 [79]) is running.

  -	Upon expiration of the Ready timer or waking up and determining it has not been paged using its nominal paging group the mobile station re-enters the eDRX based power saving state for the time remaining until its next paging occasion.

  -	A BSS that receives a PAGING-PS PDU containing eDRX information uses it to determine when the corresponding MS is reachable (see 3GPP TS 48.018 [107]).

A MS that has enabled PEO where PSM with eDRX is used supports reachability while in packet idle mode as follows:

  -	While in packet idle mode the mobile station uses the lowest eDRX cycle while the Ready timer is running.

  -	While in packet idle mode the mobile station uses the negotiated eDRX cycle while the Active timer is running and a PAGING-PS PDU received by the BSS for that mobile station shall contain eDRX information indicating the negotiated eDRX cycle.

  -	The mobile station enters the PSM based power saving state upon expiration of the Ready timer if the Active timer is not used or upon expiration of the Active timer if a non-zero Active timer is used.

  -	A BSS that receives a PAGING-PS PDU containing eDRX information will use it to determine when the corresponding MS is reachable (see 3GPP TS 48.018 [107]).

A MS that has enabled PEO where PSM without eDRX is used supports reachability while in packet idle mode as follows:

  -	While in packet idle mode the mobile station uses the broadcasted DRX cycle while the Ready timer is running. A DL-UNITDATA PDU received by the BSS for a mobile station that has enabled PSM without eDRX shall contain DRX information (if available at the SGSN).

  -	While in packet idle mode the mobile station uses the broadcasted DRX cycle while the Active timer is running and a PAGING-PS PDU received by the BSS for that mobile station shall contain DRX information (if available at the SGSN).

  -	The mobile station enters the PSM based power saving state upon expiration of the Ready timer if the Active timer is not used or upon expiration of the Active timer if a non-zero Active timer is used.

  -	A BSS that receives a PAGING-PS PDU containing DRX information will use it to determine when the corresponding MS is reachable (see 3GPP TS 48.018 [107]).


3.9.3	Extended DRX (eDRX)

A PEO capable mobile station in a cell that supports PEO that wants to use eDRX selects an eDRX cycle value from the set of available eDRX cycles (see 3GPP TS 45.002 [32]) and indicates it as its preferred eDRX cycle length when registering with the network (see 3GPP TS 24.008 [79]). A mobile station may negotiate the use of both eDRX and PSM when registering with the network in which case its power saving feature is considered to be PSM and the mobile station only makes use of eDRX based reachability when the Active timer is running (see 3GPP TS 23.060 [74] and 3GPP TS 23.682 [108]). The mobile station selects a nominal paging group determined using IMSI and its eDRX cycle and monitors pages thereon (see 3GPP TS 45.002 [32]).


3.9.4	BCCH Acquisition

A MS that has enabled PEO shall read the PEO_BCCH_CHANGE_MARK field when performing the packet access procedure (see sub-clause 3.5.2.1.2). If a change of PEO_BCCH_CHANGE_MARK is detected it shall first read SI13 before proceeding with the packet access procedure. If no change is detected and the time elapsed since it last read SI13 exceeds 24 hours it should read SI13 before proceeding with the packet access procedure.

To help avoid the case where a change in PEO_BCCH_CHANGE_MARK is detected when a MS reads its paging subchannel it may acquire an AGCH/PCH message (for the purpose of checking PEO_BCCH_CHANGE_MARK and acquiring the RCC field) before the next instance of its paging subchannel. It shall use the 6 bit BSIC from the most recently read SCH and the acquired RCC field to establish a BSIC. If the BSIC does not match the BSIC value decoded upon first entering the serving cell (see 3GPP TS 45.008) or if the RCC and PEO_BCCH_CHANGE_MARK fields are not included in the message it shall consider PEO as disabled and attempt cell re-selection.

The network indicates a change to the PEO_BCCH_CHANGE_MARK field within an IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT message using the IA Rest Octets IE (see sub-clause 10.5.2.16) or within an IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT REJECT or an IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT EXTENDED or an IMMEDIATE PACKET ASSIGNMENT message using the Feature Indicator IE (see sub-clause 10.5.2.76) or within a PAGING REQUEST TYPE 1 message using the P1 Rest Octets IE (see sub-clause 10.5.2.23) or within a PAGING REQUEST TYPE 2 message using the P2 Rest Octets IE (see sub-clause 10.5.2.24) or within a PAGING REQUEST TYPE 3 message using the P3 Rest Octets IE (see sub-clause 10.5.2.25).

Considering the time spanned by the longest eDRX cycle, changes to the PEO_BCCH_CHANGE_MARK field should not occur more frequently than 3 times within a 24 hour time period.

If a mobile station determines that more than 3 changes to the PEO_BCCH_CHANGE_MARK field have occurred within a 24 hour time period it shall disable PEO_BCCH_CHANGE_MARK monitoring for 1 hour (i.e. it shall ignore changes to the PEO_BCCH_CHANGE_MARK field when performing the packet access procedure for 1 hour), re-read system information and then resume PEO_BCCH_CHANGE_MARK monitoring. If it then determines that more than 3 changes to the PEO_BCCH_CHANGE_MARK field occur in the next hour it shall disable PEO_BCCH_CHANGE_MARK monitoring for 24 hours (i.e. it shall ignore changes to the PEO_BCCH_CHANGE_MARK field when performing the packet access procedure for 24 hours), re-read system information and then resume PEO_BCCH_CHANGE_MARK monitoring.

A mobile station in PEO may support deferred system information acquisition (see subclause 3.9.4.1).


3.9.4.1	Deferred System Information Acquisition for PEO

A mobile station that supports deferred system information acquisition for PEO, shall read BCCH after cell selection and determine from SI13 message (see subclause 9.1.43a), if the serving cell provides the PEO Idle Mode Mobility (IMM) Cell Group Definition IE, by this indicating the use of common cell parameters across a group of cells in order to potentially defer reading of BCCH data after performing a cell reselection to one of these non-serving cells.

  -	If not provided, the MS in idle mode shall apply legacy operation for BCCH acquisition until it reselects to a cell which provides the PEO Idle Mode Mobility (IMM) Cell Group Definition IE in SI13.

  -	If provided, the MS in idle mode shall determine, based on the content of the PEO IMM Cell Group Definition IE in SI13 as well as common and specific cell parameters, broadcasted in SI2 and SI3 messages, the cell parameters related to cell selection / reselection, cell barring, RA assignment and paging reception, valid for all cells belonging to the same PEO IMM cell group as its serving cell.

Prior to receiving any instance of its paging subchannel, the MS supporting deferred system information acquisition for PEO shall identify, after evaluation of the PEO_BCCH_CHANGE_MARK field, as specified in subclause 3.9.4 and as specified below for the case of activation / deactivation of deferred system information acquisition for PEO, if the serving cell has modified the PEO IMM Cell Group Definition IE, by reading an SI 13 message and / or AGCH/PCH message in order to determine the PEO IMM Cell Group Identifier and the PEO IMM Change Mark. If either of both values is different to the previously stored one, the MS is obliged to read SI 13 to obtain the latest sent PEO IMM Cell Group Definition IE.

In case PEO IMM Cell Group Definition IE is provided by the current serving cell, the MS shall use the related information when triggering measurements for cell reselection (i.e. BCCH frequencies, specific BSIC’s, PEO IMM Cell Group Identifier and PEO IMM Change Mark fields) and shall determine for non-serving cells, for which BSIC identification is required (see 3GPP TS 45.008 [34]) whether the non-serving cell supports broadcast of PEO IMM Cell Group Definition IE.. To this purpose it may acquire an SI13 message and / or an AGCH/PCH message (for the purpose of reading the RCC field, see subclause 3.9.4) which both contain the PEO IMM Cell Group Details IE (i.e. PEO IMM Cell Group Identifier and PEO IMM Change Mark fields) indicating whether the non-serving cell supports broadcast of PEO IMM Cell Group Definition IE and whether it is part of the same PEO IMM cell group as the serving cell. If the mobile station detects that the non-serving cell has the same values of the PEO IMM Cell Group Identifier and the PEO IMM Change Mark fields as its serving cell, it shall apply the common and specific cell parameters belonging to the PEO IMM cell group of its serving cell for this cell when evaluating if cell reselection is required and shall omit reading of the BCCH of this cell, else it shall read BCCH of this non-serving cell except cell reselection parameters are broadcasted for this non-serving cell in SI2n, i.e. the serving cell indicates SI2n support in SI13. If the MS detects that the PEO IMM Change Mark field in the non-serving cell, which belongs to the same PEO IMM cell group as the serving cell, has been incremented by 1 or more compared to the last one obtained in the serving cell, it immediately stops measuring non-serving cells and starts acquisition of the complete set of System Information messages in the serving cell. The MS shall use the common and specific cell parameters for all cells belonging to the same PEO IMM cell group when evaluating if cell reselection is required and identifying the target cell for reselection. If the MS has reselected to a cell that is part of the same PEO IMM cell group as its previous serving cell, it shall monitor in the new serving cell, i.e. the cell it has reselected to, its paging channel without reading the BCCH in this cell. Only in case

  -	a matching page is received, that requires to send a paging response, or

  -	the MS needs to perform an uplink data transmission, or

  -	a configurable timeout, i.e. Timeout Read Complete SI, since the last reading of the complete set of System Information messages in a different than the current serving cell is expired,

the MS is required to immediately read the complete set of System Information messages in the current serving cell.

The network may choose to deactivate deferred SI acquisition for PEO in network deployments for which System Information needs to be reconfigured rather frequently or for which adjacent cells' idle mode mobility parameters differ too much. In this case the support of deferred SI acquisition for PEO is discontinued by removing the PEO IMM Cell Group Definition IE from SI13 and PEO IMM Cell Group Details IE from AGCH/PCH messages.

Otherwise the network may choose to activate deferred SI acquisition for PEO in specific cells. In this case the support of deferred SI acquisition in EC operation is indicated by addition of the PEO IMM Cell Group Definition IE to SI 13 and PEO IMM Cell Group Details IE to AGCH/PCH messages.

The requirement for reading PEO_BCCH_CHANGE_MARK in the serving cell, as specified in subclause 3.9.4, applies also for deferred SI acquisition for PEO. In addition, in case of activation or deactivation of deferred SI acquisition for PEO, the PEO_BCCH_CHANGE_MARK field shall be incremented in the respective cells whilst in case of modification (reconfiguration) of the PEO IMM Cell Group Definition IE it shall not be incremented (rather the PEO IMM Change Mark field is incremented).


3.10	EC Operation


3.10.1	General

EC-GSM-IoT is an optional feature that allows a MS to use relaxed mobility requirements, extended coverage and optionally, a power saving feature while in packet idle mode. The power saving feature consists of either extended DRX (eDRX – see 3GPP TS 23.060) or Power Saving Mode (PSM – see 3GPP TS 23.060). A cell indicates it supports EC-GSM-IoT operation by the presence of the EC-SCH (see 3GPP TS 45.002). The relaxed mobility related requirements supported by a MS that has enabled EC operation are described in 3GPP TS 43.064 [109].

An EC-GSM-IoT capable mobile station in a cell that supports EC-GSM-IoT operation may perform NAS signalling to negotiate the use of a power saving feature. An EC-GSM-IoT capable mobile station in a cell that supports EC-GSM-IoT operation attempts packet access by:

  -	transmitting an EC PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST message using the RACH (see sub-clause 3.5.2.1.2); or

  -	transmitting an EC PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST message using the 1TS EC-RACH Mapping method (see sub-clause 3.5.2.1.2a); or

  -	transmitting an EC PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST message using the 2TS EC-RACH Mapping method (see sub-clause 3.5.2.1.2a).

When sending a response to an EC PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST message a BSS shall only assign the MS packet resources in the frequency band corresponding to CCCH or EC-CCCH on which the EC PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST message was received.

 When EC operation is enabled it shall be disabled in case the MS enters a cell that does not support EC operation or the MS decides to disable EC operation for any reason. When EC operation is disabled then the MS shall continue to use eDRX or PSM (if either one is enabled) as long as it remains in the same Routing Area it was in when it performed NAS signalling to enable eDRX/PSM.  When EC operation is disabled the use of relaxed mobility related requirements and the use of the EC PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST message shall be disabled. Upon reselecting to a cell in a new Routing Area a mobile station that has enabled eDRX/PSM shall consider it as disabled (i.e. the MS must perform additional NAS signalling in the new Routing Area to enable eDRX/PSM).


3.10.2	Power Saving States

A MS that has enabled EC operation where eDRX is used supports reachability while in packet idle mode when the Ready timer is running as described in sub-clause 3.9.2 for the case of a mobile station that uses PEO with eDRX.

A MS that has enabled EC operation where PSM with eDRX is used supports reachability while in packet idle mode when the Ready timer or Active timer is running as described in sub-clause 3.9.2 for the case of a mobile station that uses PEO with PSM and eDRX.

A MS that has enabled EC operation where PSM without eDRX is used supports reachability while in packet idle mode as follows:

  -	While in packet idle mode the mobile station uses the lowest eDRX cycle while the Ready timer is running. A DL-UNITDATA PDU received by the BSS for a mobile station that has enabled PSM without eDRX shall contain eDRX information indicating the lowest eDRX cycle.

  -	While in packet idle mode the mobile station uses the lowest eDRX cycle while the Active timer is running. A PAGING-PS PDU received by the BSS for that mobile station shall not contain eDRX information.

  -	The mobile station enters the PSM based power saving state upon expiration of the Ready timer if the Active timer is not used or upon expiration of the Active timer if a non-zero Active timer is used.

  -	A BSS that receives a PAGING-PS PDU containing eDRX information will use it to determine when the corresponding MS is reachable (see 3GPP TS 48.018 [107]).

A MS that has enabled EC operation where neither eDRX nor PSM is used supports reachability while in packet idle mode when the Ready timer is running as follows:

  -	The mobile station uses the lowest eDRX cycle while the Ready timer (see 3GPP TS 24.008 [79]) is running. A BSS that receives a DL-UNITDATA PDU (see 3GPP TS 48.018 [107]) containing coverage class information but no eDRX information shall always use the lowest eDRX cycle.

  -	Upon expiration of the Ready timer the mobile station shall continue using the lowest eDRX cycle.


3.10.3	Extended DRX (eDRX)

An EC-GSM-IoT capable mobile station in a cell that supports EC-GSM-IoT enables eDRX by selecting an eDRX cycle value from the set of available eDRX cycles (see 3GPP TS 45.002 [32]) and indicating it as its preferred eDRX cycle length when registering with the network (see 3GPP TS 24.008 [79]). If an eDRX value is successfully negotiated with the network, the mobile station shall use it when monitoring the paging channel of any cell within the Routing Area where the eDRX value was negotiated.The mobile station selects a nominal paging group on the EC-PCH of its selected EC-CCCH (see 3GPP TS 45.002 [32]) by taking into account its IMSI, its negotiated eDRX cycle and its selected downlink coverage class and monitors pages thereon (see 3GPP TS 45.002 [32]).

  -	A MS that has enabled EC operation where eDRX is used supports reachability while in packet idle mode as described in sub-clause 3.5.1a when in packet idle mode and the Ready timer is not running.

  -	A MS that has enabled EC operation where PSM is used supports reachability while in packet idle mode as described in sub-clause 3.5.1a when in packet idle mode and the Active timer is running.


3.10.4	EC-BCCH Acquisition

A MS that has enabled EC operation shall have read a complete set of EC SYSTEM INFORMATION messages set no longer than 24 hours prior to attempting packet access. In addition, if the mobile station detects a change to the EC-BCCH CHANGE MARK field when reading the EC-SCH INFORMATION message (see sub-clause 9.1.30c) it shall  subsequently read one or more EC SYSTEM INFORMATION messages as needed before attempting packet access (see sub-clause 3.5.2a). The EC SI reading can occur immediately after the EC-SCH INFORMATION reading.

To help avoid the case where a MS detects a change in EC-BCCH CHANGE MARK shortly before any instance of its paging subchannel it may acquire the EC-SCH INFORMATION message sufficiently in advance of each instance of its paging subchannel (see 3GPP TS45.002).

Each EC SYSTEM INFORMATION message instance includes an EC SI_CHANGE_MARK bitmap used by a mobile station to determine which specific EC SYSTEM INFORMATION message(s) has changed after it first detects a change to the EC-BCCH CHANGE MARK field in the EC-SCH INFORMATION message. A mobile station makes use of this bitmap as follows:

  -	Upon detecting a change to the EC-BCCH CHANGE MARK field (sent using the EC-SCH INFORMATION message) a mobile station reads any EC SYSTEM INFORMATION message to acquire the EC SI_CHANGE_MARK bitmap.

  -	If the Overflow Control Bit therein (see sub-clause 9.1.43p) has not changed since the last time the corresponding bitmap was acquired the mobile station determines which of the message specific bits (i.e. EC SI 1, EC SI 2, EC SI 3 and EC SI 4 bits - see sub-clause 9.1.43p) in the EC SI_CHANGE_MARK bitmap have changed since the last time the bitmap was acquired.

  -	The mobile station then reads the subset of EC SYSTEM INFORMATION messages for which a change has been indicated by the message specific bits of the EC SI_CHANGE_MARK bitmap.

  -	If the Overflow Control Bit has changed since the last time the mobile station acquired the EC SI_CHANGE_MARK bitmap from any EC SYSTEM INFORMATION message it shall read all EC SYSTEM INFORMATION messages.

Changes to the EC-BCCH CHANGE MARK field should not occur more frequently than 7 times per 24 hours.

A network that follows the principle of not changing the EC-BCCH CHANGE MARK field more frequently than 7 times per 24 hours should manage changes to EC SYSTEM INFORMATION messages as follows:

  -	After using a given EC-BCCH_CHANGE_MARK field code point the network should not re-use the same code point for at least 24 hours.

  -	If the time between two successive changes for any given EC SYSTEM INFORMATION message is less than 24 hours the network shall change (toggle) the Overflow Control Bit (see sub-clause 9.1.43p).

  -	After changing the Overflow Control Bit the network shall not change it again for 24 hours regardless of how many additional changes to EC SYSTEM INFORMATION messages are made in that time period (i.e. once an overflow condition is indicated using the Overflow Control Bit it shall continue to be indicated for 24 hours).

If a mobile station determines that more than 7 changes to the EC-BCCH CHANGE MARK field have occurred within a 24 hour time period or that less than 24 hours have expired since the last time the Overflow Control Bit was changed in the serving cell it shall disable EC-BCCH CHANGE MARK monitoring for 1 hour (i.e. it shall ignore changes to the EC-BCCH CHANGE MARK field when performing the packet access procedure for 1 hour), re-read system information and then resume EC-BCCH CHANGE MARK monitoring. If it then determines that more than 7 changes to the EC-BCCH CHANGE MARK field occur in the next hour or that the Overflow Control Bit changes again in the next hour it shall disable EC-BCCH CHANGE MARK monitoring for 24 hours (i.e. it shall ignore changes to the EC BCCH-CHANGE MARK field when performing the packet access procedure for 24 hours), re-read system information and then resume EC-BCCH CHANGE MARK monitoring.

A mobile station that supports deferred system information acquisition in EC operation, shall read EC-BCCH after cell selection and determine from EC SI type 2 message (see subclause 9.1.43q), if the serving cell provides the Idle Mode Mobility (IMM) Cell Group Definition, by this indicating the use of common cell parameters across a group of cells in order to potentially defer reading of EC-BCCH data after performing a cell reselection to one of these cells.

  -	If not provided, the MS shall apply legacy operation for EC-BCCH acquisition until it reselects to a cell which provides the Idle Mode Mobility (IMM) Cell Group Definition.

  -	If provided, the MS shall determine, based on the content of the IMM Cell Group Definition as well as common and specific cell parameters, broadcasted in EC SI type 2 and EC SI type 3 messages, the cell parameters related to cell selection / reselection, cell barring, downlink coverage class selection in idle mode, RA assignment and paging reception, valid for all cells belonging to the same IMM Cell Group as its serving cell.

Prior to receiving any instance of its paging subchannel, the MS supporting deferred system information acquisition in EC operation shall identify, after evaluation of the EC-BCCH CHANGE MARK field as specified above, if the current serving cell provides the IMM Cell Group Definition, by reading two consecutive EC-SCH Information messages, starting in the 51-multiframe M with M mod 8 = 0, in order to determine the IMM Cell Group Identifier and the IMM Change Mark. If either of both values is different to the previously stored one, the MS is obliged to read EC SI 2 to either obtain the latest sent IMM Cell Group Definition, if its provision is indicated by the cell, or, if its provision is not indicated by the cell, to obtain cell parameters related to legacy operation for EC-BCCH acquisition.

In case IMM Cell Group Definition is provided by the current serving cell, the MS in idle mode shall use the related information when triggering measurements for cell reselection (i.e. BCCH frequencies, specific BSIC’s, IMM Cell Group Identifier and IMM Change Mark) and shall identify, by reading two consecutive EC-SCH Information messages in the non-serving cell, starting in the 51-multiframe M with M mod 8 = 0, whether the non-serving cell supports broadcast of IMM Cell Group Definition (see subclause 9.1.30c) and if yes, whether a non-serving cell is part of the same IMM Cell Group as the current serving cell. If the mobile station detects that the non-serving cell is part of the same IMM Cell Group and the IMM Change Mark has the same value as in the serving cell, it shall apply the common and specific cell parameters belonging to the IMM Cell Group for this cell when evaluating if cell reselection is required and shall omit reading of the EC-BCCH of this cell, else it shall read EC-BCCH of this non-serving cell in case no cell reselection parameters are broadcasted for this cell in EC SI type 3 message. If the MS detects that the IMM Change Mark in the non-serving cell, belonging to the same IMM Cell Group as the current serving cell, has been incremented by 1 or more compared to the last one obtained in the serving cell, it immediately stops measuring non- serving cells and starts to acquire a full set of EC System Information messages in the serving cell.

The MS shall use the common and specific cell parameters for all cells belonging to the same IMM Cell Group when evaluating if cell reselection is required and identifying the target cell for reselection. If the MS has reselected to a cell that is part of the same IMM Cell Group which the previous serving cell belongs to, it shall monitor in the current serving cell, i.e. the cell it has reselected to, its paging channel and, if applicable, its paging indication channel, without reading the EC-BCCH in this cell.

Only in case

  -	a matching page is received, that requires to send a paging response, or

  -	the MS needs to perform an uplink data transmission, or

  -	a configurable timeout, i.e. Timeout Read Complete SI, since the last reading of the complete set of EC System Information messages in a different than the current serving cell is expired,

 the MS is required to immediately read the complete set of EC System Information messages in the current serving cell.

 The network may choose to deactivate deferred SI acquisition in EC operation in network deployments for which EC System Information needs to be reconfigured rather frequently or for which adjacent cells' idle mode mobility parameters differ too much. In this case the support of deferred SI acquisition in EC operation is discontinued by removing the IMM Cell Group Definition IE from EC SI 2 and indicating in the IMM CGI field of the EC-SCH Information message ‘IMM Cell Group Definition is not broadcasted or not supported in the cell’.

 Otherwise the network may choose to activate deferred SI acquisition in EC operation in specific cells. In this case the support of deferred SI acquisition in EC operation is indicated by addition of the IMM Cell Group Definition IE to EC SI 2 and by the IMM CGI field in the EC-SCH Information message indicating ‘Cell belongs to IMM Cell Group Identity X’ with X being 1, 2, …, or 7.


3.10.5	Extended Coverage

An EC-GSM-IoT capable mobile station supports extended coverage whereby blind physical layer transmissions are used on both the uplink and downlink according to the current coverage conditions and the logical channel used (see 3GPP TS 45.002). Four different coverage classes for downlink and five coverage classes for uplink are defined, each corresponding to a fixed number of blind physical layer transmissions for each logical channel, where the fixed number of blind physical layer transmissions need not be the same for different logical channels belonging to the same coverage class. A mobile station that has enabled EC operation selects its uplink and downlink coverage class based on thresholds broadcast by the network. The mobile station uses its selected uplink coverage class to determine the number of blind physical layer transmissions to use when sending an EC PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST message (see sub-clause 3.5.2a) and includes the selected downlink coverage class in the message (see sub-clause 9.1.65).

Upon determining that its currently selected downlink coverage class has changed, a mobile station that has enabled EC operation shall trigger the transmission of a cell update under certain conditions (see 3GPP TS 45.008).

Blind physical layer transmissions in a cell on EC-PDTCH and EC-PACCH channels in uplink and downlink are mapped on to either 4 consecutive PDCH resources or 2 consecutive PDCH resources. The number of consecutive PDCH resources used for EC TBF operation in an EC-GSM-IoT capable cell is controlled via the EC System information type 2 message. The mapping of EC channels onto physical channels shall be as specified in 3GPP TS 45.002.


3.10.6	EC-CCCH/D Operation

On EC-CCCH/D, the EC-CCCH blocks designated to mobile stations in CC1 and to mobile stations in the higher coverage classes (CC2, CC3 and CC4) use different training sequences. For EC-PCH and EC-AGCH, the TSC shall be selected from the TSC Set 1, if the EC-PCH / EC-AGCH block, is designated to MSs in CC1 only and shall be selected from TSC Set 2 if the EC-PCH / EC-AGCH block, is designated to at least one MS in a higher coverage class (CC2, CC3 or CC4).

A mobile station in idle mode which has selected a higher coverage class (CC2, CC3 or CC4) attempts to detect, based on the training sequence in the received bursts, whether the EC-CCCH/D block is sent to mobile stations in the lower coverage class CC1 and if detected, may suspend further reception of the EC-CCCH/D blocks belonging to the selected coverage class.

A mobile station in idle mode which has selected CC1 as downlink coverage class needs to decode the received EC-CCCH/D block, irrespective of whether the EC-CCCH/D block is designated to mobile stations in CC1 or mobile stations in the higher coverage classes (CC2, CC3 and CC4). In both cases it attempts to decode, based on the detected training sequence in the received bursts, the message sent on EC-CCCH/D.

A mobile station which supports monitoring of the EC paging indication channel, camps on a cell that indicates paging indication channel support and has selected CC3 or CC4 as downlink coverage class, shall monitor in idle mode the EC paging indication channel (EC-PICH) in a cell which indicates EC paging indication channel support in EC System Information type 2 (see subclause 9.1.43q). The mapping between the paging block of the mobile station and the EC-PICH block which the mobile station shall monitor is specified in 3GPP TS 45.002 [32]). If the EC-PICH block indicates that no paging message is scheduled in the EC-CCCH/D blocks corresponding to its paging block, the mobile station enters into sleep mode until the next paging occasion after completion of the current (e)DRX cycle. Else if the EC-PICH block indicates presence of a paging message in the EC-CCCH/D blocks corresponding to its paging block, the mobile station shall read its paging block.

On EC-PICH channel, for a mobile station that has selected CC4 as downlink coverage class, the paging indication sequence contained in the EC PAGING INDICATION message (see subclause 9.1.69) corresponds to the wake-up or go-to-sleep indication for the paging block mapped to the EC-PICH block. For a mobile station that has selected CC3 as downlink coverage class, the paging indication sequence contained in the EC PAGING INDICATION message (see subclause 9.1.69) corresponds to the wake-up or go-to-sleep indication for any of the two paging blocks mapped to the EC-PICH block (see 3GPP TS 45.002 [32]). A mobile station which supports monitoring of EC paging indication channel detects the paging indication sequence contained within the EC PAGING INDICATION message based on the received bursts of the EC-PICH block (e.g. based on correlation of the received bursts against the expected bursts from a candidate paging indication sequence as specified in subclause 9.1.69) and determines whether to further receive the EC-CCCH/D blocks corresponding to the EC-PICH block based on the detected sequence.


3.11	Multilateration Timing Advance


3.11.1	General

Multilateration Timing Advance (MTA) is an optional MS feature whereby a MS attempts system access in multiple cells to allow the network to acquire information applicable for estimating the position of the MS (see 3GPP TS 43.059 and 3GPP TS 44.031). The MTA_BITMAP parameter sent in SI13 (see sub-clause 10.5.2.37b) and EC SI 2 (see sub-clause 9.1.43q) indicates if the Multilateration Timing Advance procedure is supported in a cell.

  -	A MS performs the radio access part of the MTA procedure using a set of autonomously selected cells which may include one or more cells for which it receives corresponding assistance information in the RRLP Multilateration Timing Advance Request message it receives from the SMLC (see 3GPP TS 44.031).

  -	Assistance information may provide information for multiple sets of cells. When multiple cells are identified for any given set then each cell in that set shall be viewed as being co-sited and the MS shall therefore at most use one cell from that set when performing the radio access part of the MTA procedure.

  -	A MS that supports the Multilateration Timing Advance feature shall support one or more of the RLC Data Block method (see sub-clause 3.11.2), Access Burst method (see sub-clause 3.11.3) and Extended Access Burst method (3.11.4) for performing the radio access part of the MTA procedure.

  -	If the information required to perform the radio access part of a MTA procedure in a cell selected by the MS is not provided by the assistance information but can be acquired by reading SI 13 (if PEO is enabled) or EC SI 2 information (if EC-GSM-IoT is enabled) then the MS shall read the necessary system information prior to performing the radio access part of the MTA procedure therein. Otherwise, it shall perform the radio access part of the MTA procedure in that cell using the RLC Data Block method if supported by both the MS and the selected cell.

  -	If the MS does not support the MTA method indicated by the RRLP Multilateration Timing Advance Request message it shall use the RLC Data Block method if both the MS and the selected cells support the RLC Data Block method.


3.11.2	RLC Data Block Method

Upon selecting a cell in which to perform the radio access part of a MTA procedure a MS shall use the RLC Data Block method therein if the corresponding RRLP Multilateration Timing Advance Request message (see 3GPP TS 44.031) indicates it is to use the RLC Data Block method and both the MS and cell support that method.

  -	If PEO is enabled a MS performs the radio access part of the MTA procedure using this method by sending an EGPRS MULTILATERATION REQUEST on the RACH indicating ‘RLC Data Block method’ (see sub-clause 3.5.2.1.2), is assigned an uplink EGPRS TBF and sends a single MCS-1 coded RLC data block thereon.

  -	If EC operation is enabled a MS performs the radio access part of the MTA procedure using this method by sending an EC MULTILATERATION REQUEST message on the EC-RACH indicating ‘RLC Data Block method’ (see sub-clause 3.5.2.1.2a), is assigned an uplink EC TBF and sends a single MCS-1 coded RLC data block thereon.

  -	In both cases the "TLLI", "Cell Identity", "Routing Area Identification", "MS Sync Accuracy", "MS Transmission Offset" and "Random ID" parameters are conveyed from the MS to the BSS (see 3GPP TS 44.060 [76]).


3.11.3	Access Burst Method

Upon selecting a cell in which to perform the radio access part of a MTA procedure a MS shall use the Access Burst method therein if the corresponding RRLP Multilateration Timing Advance Request message (see 3GPP TS 44.031) indicates it is to use the Access Burst method and both the MS and cell support that method.

  -	If EC operation is enabled a MS performs the radio access part of the MTA procedure using this method by sending an EC MULTILATERATION REQUEST message on the EC-RACH indicating ‘Access Burst method’ (see sub-clause 9.1.65).

  NOTE:	This method allows to convey MS originated information for the radio access part of the MTA procedure over EC-RACH and does not require establishing an EC TBF.


3.11.4	Extended Access Burst Method

Upon selecting a cell in which to perform the radio access part of a MTA procedure a MS shall use the Extended Access Burst method therein if the corresponding RRLP Multilateration Timing Advance Request message (see 3GPP TS 44.031) indicates it is to use the Extended Access Burst method and both the MS and cell support that method.

  -	If PEO is enabled a MS performs the radio access part of the MTA procedure using this method by sending two instances of an EGPRS MULTILATERATION REQUEST message on the RACH indicating ‘Extended Access Burst method’ (see 3GPP TS 44.060 [76]).

  -	If EC operation is enabled a MS performs the radio access part of the MTA procedure using this method by sending two instances of an EC MULTILATERATION REQUEST message on the EC-RACH indicating ‘Extended Access Burst method’ (see sub-clause 3.5.2.1.2a and sub-clause 9.1.65).

  -	In both cases the "MS Transmission Offset", "MS Sync Accuracy", "Random ID" and "Short BSS ID" parameters are conveyed from the MS to the BSS (see sub-clause 9.1.65 and 3GPP TS 44.060 [76]).

  NOTE:	This method allows to convey MS originated information for the radio access part of the MTA procedure over RACH or EC-RACH, respectively, and does not require establishing an EGPRS TBF or EC TBF, respectively.





3.11.5	BSS Support of Multilateration Timing Advance

If a MS performs the radio access part of the MTA procedure using the RLC Data Block method and the corresponding BSS determines it has not triggered the MTA procedure (i.e. it has not sent the SMLC a request for a location estimate for the MS, see 3GPP TS 49.031) the BSS sends the estimated "Timing Advance Value",  "Cell Identity" of the cell for which the Timing Advance value was estimated, the "BTS Reception Accuracy Level" applicable to the BTS that derived the Timing Advance value, the extracted "TLLI", the extracted "Cell Identity", the extracted "Routing Area Identification" and the extracted "MS Sync Accuracy" to the MSC (see 3GPP TS 48.008).

If a MS performs the radio access part of the MTA procedure using the Extended Access Burst method and the corresponding BSS determines it has not triggered the MTA procedure the BSS sends the estimated "Timing Advance Value",  "Cell Identity" of the cell for which the Timing Advance value was estimated, the "BTS Reception Accuracy Level" applicable to the BTS that derived the Timing Advance value, the extracted "Random ID", the extracted "Short BSS ID" and the extracted "MS Sync Accuracy" to the MSC (see 3GPP TS 48.008).

If a MS performs the radio access part of the MTA procedure using the RLC Data Block method or the Extended Access Burst method and the corresponding BSS determines it has triggered the MTA procedure (i.e. it sent the SMLC a request for a location estimate corresponding to the extracted "TLLI" or "Random ID", see 3GPP TS 49.031) the BSS sends its default SMLC the estimated "Timing Advance Value", the "Cell Identity" of the cell for which the Timing Advance value was estimated, the "BTS Reception Accuracy Level" applicable to the BTS that derived the Timing Advance value and the extracted "MS Sync Accuracy". Note that the "Timing Advance Value" is adjusted according to the "MS Transmission Offset" parameter extracted from the RLC Data Block or extracted from the first of two EGPRS MULTILATERATION REQUEST messages sent when PEO is enabled or extracted from the first of two EC MULTILATERATION REQUEST messages sent when EC operation is enabled (see 3GPP TS 44.060 [76], see sub-clause 9.1.65 and see 3GPP TS 45.010).

If a MS performs the radio access part of the MTA procedure using the Access Burst method and the corresponding BSS determines it triggered the MTA procedure it sends its default SMLC the estimated "Timing Advance Value", the "Cell Identity" of the cell for which the Timing Advance value was estimated and the "BTS Reception Accuracy Level" applicable to the BTS that derived the Timing Advance value.

When sending a EGPRS MULTILATERATION REQUEST message or EC MULTILATERATION REQUEST message the MS uses the Final MTA Access field (see sub-clause 9.1.65 and 3GPP TS 44.060 [76]) to indicate whether or not it is in the last cell it will use to perform the radio access part of the MTA procedure. If it indicates it is in the last cell it will use to perform the radio access part of the MTA procedure then upon completion of the radio access part of the MTA procedure in that cell it stops the MPM timer and terminates the MTA procedure. Upon receiving an EGPRS MULTILATERATION REQUEST message or EC MULTILATERATION REQUEST message indicating the MS is in the last cell it will use to perform the radio access part of the MTA procedure the BSS shall complete the MTA procedure for the MS in the current cell, inform the SMLC that no additional timing advance information is pending for the current MTA procedure (see 3GPP TS 49.031), stop the corresponding MPM timer and terminate the MTA procedure. In addition, upon receiving an uplink LLC PDU and determining that a MPM timer is running for the corresponding MS,  the BSS shall inform the SMLC that no additional timing advance information is pending for the current MTA procedure, stop the corresponding MPM timer and terminate the MTA procedure.

8	Handling of unknown, unforeseen, and erroneous protocol data


8.1	General

The procedures specified in this technical specification apply to those messages which pass the checks described in this sub-clause.

This sub-clause also specifies procedures for the handling of unknown, unforeseen, and erroneous protocol data by the receiving entity. These procedures are called "error handling procedures", but in addition to providing recovery mechanisms for error situations they define a compatibility mechanism for future extensions of the protocols.

Sub-clauses 8.1 to 8.8 shall be applied in order of precedence.

Most error handling procedures are mandatory for the mobile station.

Detailed error handling procedures in the network are implementation dependent and may vary from PLMN to PLMN. However, when extensions of this protocol are developed, networks will be assumed to have the error handling that is indicated in this sub-clause as mandatory ("shall") and that is indicated as strongly recommended ("should"). Sub-clauses 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5 and 8.7.2 do not apply to the error handling in the network applied to the receipt of initial layer 3 message: If the network diagnoses an error described in one of these sub-clauses in the initial layer 3 message received from the mobile station, it shall either:

  -	try to recognize the classmark and then take further implementation dependent actions; or

  -	release the RR-connection.

Also, the error handling of the network is only considered as mandatory or strongly recommended when certain thresholds for errors are not reached during a dedicated connection.

In this sub-clause the following terminology is used:

  -	An IE is defined to be syntactically incorrect in a message if it contains at least one value defined as "reserved" in sub-clause 10, or if its value part violates rules of clause 10. However it is not a syntactical error that a type 4 IE specifies in its length indicator a greater length than defined in clause 10.

  -	A message is defined to have semantically incorrect contents if it contains information which, possibly dependent on the state of the receiver, is in contradiction to the resources of the receiver and/or to the procedural part (i.e. Clauses 3, 4, 5) of this technical specification.


8.2	Message too short

When a message is received that is too short to contain a complete message type information element, that message shall be ignored, cf. 3GPP TS 24.007.


8.3	(void)


8.4	Unknown or unforeseen message type

If a mobile station or the network receives a GTTP message with message type not defined for the PD or not implemented by the receiver, it shall ignore the message.

If a mobile station receives an RR message with message type not defined for the PD or not implemented by the receiver in unacknowledged mode, it shall ignore the message.

If a mobile station in packet idle mode has enabled EC operation then it shall interpret RR messages received on the EC-CCCH as described in sub-clause 10.1.

If a mobile station receives an RR message with message type not defined for the PD or not implemented by the receiver in acknowledged mode, it shall return a status message (RR STATUS) with cause # 97 "message type non-existent or not implemented".

If the network receives an RR message with message type not defined for the PD or not implemented by the receiver in a protocol state where reception of an unsolicited message with the given PD from the mobile station is not foreseen in the protocol, the network actions are implementation dependent. Otherwise, if the network receives an RR message with message type not defined for the PD or not implemented by the receiver, it shall ignore the message except that it should return a status message (RR STATUS) with cause #97 "message type non-existent or not implemented".

  NOTE:	A message type not defined for the PD in the given direction is regarded by the receiver as a message type not defined for the PD, see 3GPP TS 24.007.

If the mobile station receives an RR message not compatible with the protocol state, the mobile station shall ignore the message except for the fact that, if an RR connection exists, it returns a status message (RR STATUS) with cause #98 "Message type not compatible with protocol state".

If the network receives an RR message not compatible with the protocol state, the network actions are implementation dependent.


8.5	Non-semantical mandatory information element errors

When on receipt of a message,

  -	an "imperative message part" error; or

  -	a "missing mandatory IE" error;

is diagnosed or when a message containing:

  -	a syntactically incorrect mandatory IE; or

  -	an IE unknown in the message, but encoded as "comprehension required" (see 3GPP TS 24.007); or

  -	an out of sequence IE encoded as "comprehension required" (see 3GPP TS 24.007);

is received:

  -	the mobile station shall proceed as follows:

    -	for RR protocol, if the message is not one of the messages listed in sub-clause 8.5.1 the mobile station shall ignore the message except for the fact that, if an RR connection exists, it shall return a status message (RR STATUS) with cause # 96 "Invalid mandatory information";

    -	for GTTP, the mobile station shall ignore the message.

  -	the network shall proceed as follows:

    -	for RR protocol, the network shall either:

       -	try to treat the message (the exact further actions are implementation dependent); or

       -	ignore the message except that it should return a status message (RR STATUS) with cause # 96 "Invalid mandatory information".

    -	for GTTP, the network shall ignore the message.


8.5.1	Radio resource management

For the mobile station the following procedures shall apply:

  a)	If the message is a CHANNEL RELEASE message, the actions taken shall be the same as specified in sub-clause 3.4.13 "RR connection release".

  b)	If the message is a PARTIAL RELEASE message, the reactions of the MS are for further study.


8.6	Unknown and unforeseen IEs in the non-imperative message part


8.6.1	IEIs unknown in the message

The MS shall ignore all IEs unknown in a message which are not encoded as "comprehension required" (see 3GPP TS 24.007).

The network shall take the same approach.


8.6.2	Out of sequence IEs

The MS shall ignore all out of sequence IEs in a message which are not encoded as "comprehension required" (see 3GPP TS 24.007).

The network should take the same approach.


8.6.3	Repeated IEs

If an information element with format T, TV, or TLV is repeated in a message in which repetition of the information element is not specified in clause 9 of this technical specification, only the contents of the information element appearing first shall be handled and all subsequent repetitions of the information element shall be ignored. When repetition of information elements is specified, only the contents of specified repeated information elements shall be handled. If the limit on repetition of information elements is exceeded, the contents of information elements appearing first up to the limit of repetitions shall be handled and all subsequent repetitions of the information element shall be ignored.

The network should follow the same procedures.


8.7	Non-imperative message part errors

This category includes:

  -	syntactically incorrect optional IEs;

  -	conditional IE errors.


8.7.1	Syntactically incorrect optional IEs

The MS shall treat all optional IEs that are syntactically incorrect in a message as not present in the message.

The network shall take the same approach.


8.7.2	Conditional IE errors

When the MS upon receipt of an RR message diagnoses a "missing conditional IE" error or an "unexpected conditional IE" error or when it receives an RR message containing at least one syntactically incorrect conditional IE, it shall ignore the message except for the fact that, if an RR connection exists, it shall return a status message (RR STATUS) with cause value # 100 "conditional IE error".

When the MS or the network upon receipt of a GTTP message diagnoses a "missing conditional IE" error or an "unexpected conditional IE" error or when it receives a GTTP message containing at least one syntactically incorrect conditional IE, it shall ignore the message.

When the network receives an RR message and diagnose a "missing conditional IE" error or an "unexpected conditional IE" error or when it receives an RR message containing at least one syntactically incorrect conditional IE, the network shall either:

  -	try to treat the message (the exact further actions are implementation dependent); or

  -	ignore the message except that it should return a status message (RR STATUS) with cause # 100 "conditional IE error".


8.8	Messages with semantically incorrect contents

When a message with semantically incorrect contents is received, the foreseen reactions of the procedural part of 3GPP TS 44.018 are performed. If however no such reactions are specified, the MS shall ignore the message except for the RR protocol in which case, if an RR connection exists, it returns a status message (RR STATUS) with cause value # 95 "semantically incorrect message".

The network should follow the same procedure except that a status message is not normally transmitted.


8.9	Incomplete rest octets

When the number of octets in a rest octets information element is too small to contain the complete set of components, these components may be truncated by the sending entity (i.e. the network) to fit into the rest octets information element. Whether or not truncation is allowed depends on the construction of the rest octets information element and must be explicitly specified in the relevant rest octet definition (truncated concatenation).

If truncation is allowed, the mobile station shall assume the value 'L' for the missing components.

If the trunctation is not specified for the relevant rest octet definition, the sending entity must ensure that the complete set of components fits into the rest octets.

A truncated concatenation is an ordered sequence of components encapsulated in curly brackets and followed by the '//' postfix. The components are the terms appearing at the first level of the concatenation construction.

The truncated concatenation is equivalent either to the null string or to a concatenation including any number of the components of the sequence put in the same consecutive order and starting with the first component.

As an example, the set:

| { < a > < b > < c > }//                                                                                                                      |


is equivalent to:

| { < a > < b > < c > } or                                                                                                                     |
|{ < a > < b > } or                                                                                                                            |
|{ < a > } or                                                                                                                                  |
|null                                                                                                                                          |



9	Message functional definitions and contents

This sub-clause defines the structure of the messages of those layer 3 protocols defined in 3GPP TS 44.018. These are standard L3 messages as defined in 3GPP TS 24.007 with the exception of those sent on the SCH, RACH, and the HANDOVER ACCESS message.

Each definition given in the present sub-clause includes:

  a)	a brief description of the message direction and use, including whether the message has:

    1.	Local significance, i.e. relevant only on the originating or terminating access;

    2.	Access significance, i.e. relevant in the originating and terminating access, but not in the network;

    3.	Dual significance, i.e. relevant in either the originating or terminating access and in the network; or

    4.	Global significance, i.e. relevant in the originating and terminating access and in the network.

  b)	a table listing the information elements known in the message and their order of their appearance in the message. All information elements that may be repeated are explicitly indicated. (V and LV formatted IEs, which compose the imperative part of the message, occur before T, TV, and TLV formatted IEs which compose the non-imperative part of the message, cf. 3GPP TS 24.007.) In a (maximal) sequence of consecutive information elements with half octet length, the first information element with half octet length occupies bits 1 to 4 of octet N, the second bits 5 to 8 of octet N, the third bits 1 to 4 of octet N+1 etc. Such a sequence always has an even number of elements.

	For each information element the table indicates:

    1.	the information element identifier, in hexadecimal notation, if the IE has format T, TV, or TLV. Usually, there is a default IEI for an information element type; default IEIs of different IE types of the same protocol are different. If the IEI has half octet length, it is specified by a notation representing the IEI as a hexadecimal digit followed by a "-" (example: B-).

  NOTE	The same IEI may be used for different information element types in different messages of the same protocol.

    2.	the name of the information element (which may give an idea of the semantics of the element). The name of the information element (usually written in italics) followed by "IE" or "information element" is used in 3GPP TS 44.018 as reference to the information element within a message.

    3.	the name of the type of the information element (which indicates the coding of the value part of the IE), and generally, the referenced sub-clause of clause 10 of 3GPP TS 44.018 describing the value part of the information element.

    4.	the presence requirement indication (M, C, or O) for the IE as defined in 3GPP TS 24.007.

    5.	The format of the information element (T, V, TV, LV, TLV) as defined in 3GPP TS 24.007.

    6.	The length of the information element (or permissible range of lengths), in octets, in the message, where "?" means that the maximum length of the IE is only constrained by link layer protocol. This indication is non-normative.

  c)	sub-clauses specifying, where appropriate, conditions for IEs with presence requirement C or O in the relevant message which together with other conditions specified in 3GPP TS 44.018 define when the information elements shall be included or not, what non-presence of such IEs means, and - for IEs with presence requirement C - the static conditions for presence and/or non-presence of the IEs (cf. 3GPP TS 24.007).

9.1.1.1	Mobile Allocation

This information element shall appear if the Channel Description information element indicates frequency hopping.

If the Channel Description IE does not indicate frequency hopping and the information element is present it shall be considered as an IE unnecessary in the message.


9.1.1.2	Starting Time

This information element appears in particular if e.g., a change of frequency is planned.


9.1.1.3	Extended TSC Set

If the message is sent to a mobile station that indicates support for extended TSC sets (see 3GPP TS 24.008 [79]) this information element may be included to provide TSC related information for the assigned radio resources. In the absence of this information element the TSC related information provided by the Channel Description IE shall apply.

9.1.2	Assignment command

This message is sent on the main DCCH by the network to the mobile station to change the channel configuration to another independent dedicated channel configuration, when no timing adjustment is needed. See table 9.1.2.1.

  Message type:	ASSIGNMENT COMMAND

9.1.2.1	Mode of the First Channel (Channel Set 1) and Mode of Channel Set "X" (2=<X=<8)

If this information element is not present the channel mode of the previously allocated channel or channels for Channel Set "X" (1=<X<=8) shall be assumed.

If Channel Set "X" is not defined for the configuration, the Mode of Channel Set "X" IE shall be considered as an IE unnecessary in the message.

  NOTE:	Sub-clause 3.4.3.1 defines cases when one or several Mode of Channel Set "X" IEs shall be included in the message.


9.1.2.2	Description of the Second Channel

These information elements appear in the case of an assignment occurring if the mobile station carries two connections (on two dedicated channels, for the TCH/H + TCH/H configuration).

The connection using the channel previously defined in the Description of the First Channel IEs of an ASSIGNMENT COMMAND or HANDOVER COMMAND message shall use the channel defined in the Description of the First Channel IEs of the ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message defining the new configuration.

The channel described in the Description of the First Channel IEs carries the main DCCH. The SACCH used is the one associated with that channel.


9.1.2.3	Mode of the Second Channel

If no Description of the Second Channel IE is present but the information element is present it shall be considered as an IE unnecessary in the message.

This information element appears at least when the channel mode is changed for the channel defined in the second channel description information elements.


9.1.2.4	Mobile Allocation and Frequency List, after the starting time

If at least one of the channel descriptions for the starting time indicates frequency hopping, one and only one of the following information elements shall be present and apply to all assigned channels:

  -	Mobile Allocation, after time;

  -	Frequency List, after time.

If neither of the Channel Description IEs for after time indicate frequency hopping, if decoding of Channel Description IEs for before time does not require a frequency list for after time (see next sub-clause), and one or both of the two information elements are present they shall be considered as IEs unnecessary in the message.


9.1.2.5	Starting Time

The starting time information element is included when the network wants the mobile station to change the frequency parameters of the channels more or less at the moment a change of channel occurs. In this case a number of information elements may be included to give the frequency parameters to be used before the starting time.

If the starting time information element is present and none of the information elements referring to before the starting time are present, the mobile station waits and accesses the channels at the indicated time.

If the starting time information element is present and at least one of the information elements referring to before the starting time is present, the mobile station does not wait for the indicated time and accesses the channel using the frequency parameters for before the starting time.

If the starting time information element is not present and at some of the information elements referring to before the starting time is present, these information elements shall be considered as IEs unnecessary in the message.

If the description of the first channel, before time IE is not present, the channel description to apply for before the time, if needed, is given by the description of the first channel, after time IE.

If the description of the second channel, after time IE is present, the description of the second channel, before time IE not present, and a description of the configuration for before the time needed, the channel configuration before the starting time is nevertheless of two traffic channels, and the channel description to apply to the second channel before the starting time is given by the description of the second channel, after time IE.

If the starting time IE is present and at least one of the channel descriptions for before the starting time indicates frequency hopping, one and only one of the following information elements may be present and applies before the starting time to all assigned channels:

  -	Mobile Allocation, before time IE;

  -	Frequency list, before time IE;

  -	Frequency channel sequence, before time IE.

If the starting time IE is present and at least one of the channel descriptions for before the starting time indicates frequency hopping, and none of the above mentioned IE is present, a frequency list for after the starting time must be present (see sub-clause 9.1.2.4), and this list applies also for the channels before the starting time.


9.1.2.6	Reference cell frequency list

If any of the mobile allocation information elements is present, then the network must ensure that either the mobile station has received in a previous message the proper reference cell frequency list (CA), or that the cell channel description IE is present.

If the cell channel description IE is present, it is used to decode the mobile allocation IEs in the message, as well as in later messages until reception of a new reference cell frequency list or the cell is left.


9.1.2.7	Cell Channel Description

If present, this information element shall be used to decode the Mobile Allocation IE in the same message and in subsequent messages.


9.1.2.8	Cipher Mode Setting

If this information element is omitted, the mode of ciphering is not changed after the mobile station has switched to the assigned channel.

Only applicable for mobile stations supporting VGCS talking:

  -	The cipher mode setting IE shall not be included if the ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message is sent on a VGCS channel or dedicated channel in order to assign a VGCS channel.

  -	The cipher mode setting IE shall be included if the ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message is sent on a ciphered VGCS channel in order to assign a dedicated channel. If the information element is not present, the MS shall use ciphering mode "no ciphering" on the assigned channel.


9.1.2.9	VGCS target mode Indication

This information element is identified as "comprehension required". Only mobile stations supporting "VGCS talking" are required to accept the presence of the element. The presence of the element shall trigger an exception handling if received by a mobile station not supporting "VGCS talking".

This IE indicates which mode is to be used on the new channel (i.e. dedicated mode or group transmit mode). If this information element is not present, the mode shall be the same as on the previous channel.

The IE also indicates the group cipher key number for the group cipher key to be used on the new channel or if the new channel is non ciphered. If the information element is not present, the ciphering mode shall be the same as on the previous channel.

  NOTE:	A mobile station supporting VGCS talking shall not consider a syntactical error when this IE is present and the channel mode is not speech.


9.1.2.10	Description of the multislot allocation

This information element is included if so indicated by the channel type and TDMA offset field in the Channel Description information element and is used to assign channels that do not carry a main signalling link in a multislot configuration. It indicates how the used timeslots are divided into separate channel sets.

If the Channel Description IE does not require the presence of the information element the Description of the multislot allocation IE shall be considered as an IE unnecessary in the message.

If multislot configuration is indicated by the Channel Description IE but the Multislot Allocation IE is not present, all channels in the configuration belong to one channel set, "Channel Set 1".

  NOTE:	As a change of timeslot number cannot occur for the channel described after the starting time, the Multislot Allocation IE does not have to be included more than once.


9.1.2.11	Multi Rate configuration

This information element appears if the Mode of the First Channel indicates a multi-rate speech codec, and if the assigned configuration is new, i.e. it is different from the MultiRateconfiguration of a previously allocated channel in the cell.


9.1.2.12	VGCS Ciphering Parameters

This information element is only applicable to a VGCS mobile station. It is only included if the assigned resource is ciphered using VGCS ciphering.


9.1.2.13	Extended TSC Set, after time

If the message is sent to a mobile station that indicates support for extended TSC sets (see 3GPP TS 24.008 [79]) this information element may be included to provide TSC related information for the assigned radio resources. In the absence of this information element the TSC related information provided by the Description of the First Channel, after time IE shall apply.


9.1.2.14	Extended TSC Set, before time

If the message is sent to a mobile station that indicates support for extended TSC sets (see 3GPP TS 24.008 [79]) this information element may be included to provide TSC related information for the assigned radio resources. In the absence of this information element the TSC related information provided by the Description of the First Channel, before time IE shall apply. If the Description of the First Channel, before time IE is not present, the TSC related information to apply for before the time, if needed, is given by the Extended TSC Set, after time IE.

9.1.3	Assignment complete

9.1.5.1	Channel Description

This is sufficient to identify the channel in the case of a TCH/H + TCH/H configuration. If used for a multislot configuration, the IE shall describe the present channel configuration with TN indicating the main channel. The IE shall not indicate a new channel configuration when included in the Channel Mode Modify message.


9.1.5.2	VGCS target mode Indication

This information element is identified as "comprehension required". Only mobile stations supporting "VGCS talking" are required to accept the presence of the element. The presence of the element shall trigger an exception handling if received by a mobile station not supporting "VGCS talking".

This IE indicates which RR mode is to be used with the new channel mode (i.e. dedicated mode or group transmit mode). If this information element is not present, the RR mode shall be the same as with the previous channel mode.

When the RR mode of the new channel mode is group transmit mode, the IE also indicates the group cipher key number for the group cipher key to be used on the new channel or if the new channel is non ciphered. If the information element is not present, the ciphering mode shall be the same as with the previous channel mode.

  NOTE:	A mobile station supporting VGCS Talking shall not consider a syntactical error if this IE is present and the channel mode is not speech.


9.1.5.3	Multi Rate configuration

This information element appears if the Channel Mode IE indicates a multi-rate speech codec.


9.1.5.4	VGCS Ciphering Parameters

This information element is only applicable to a VGCS talker. It is only included if the assigned resource is ciphered using VGCS ciphering.


9.1.5.5	Extended TSC Set

If the message is sent to a mobile station that indicates support for extended TSC sets (see 3GPP TS 24.008 [79]) this information element may be included to provide TSC related information for the assigned radio resources. In the absence of this information element the TSC related information provided by the Channel Description 2 IE shall apply.

  NOTE 1:	The network may only send either the Group Channel Description or the Group Channel Description 2 element.


9.1.7.1	Group Channel Description / Group Channel Description 2

If a CHANNEL RELEASE is sent to a mobile station which is in dedicated mode and which is involved in a voice group call or has responded to a notification to a voice group call or voice broadcast call, a group channel description (or group channel description 2) may be included, describing the voice group call channel or voice broadcast channel to which the mobile station shall go after the channel release procedure.

Mobile stations not supporting VGCS listening or VBS listening shall ignore the group channel description (or group channel description 2)information element if present.


9.1.7.2	Group Cipher Key Number

This IE may be present only if the Group channel description IE or the Group Channel Description 2 IE is provided. The presence of these IE indicates that the mobile station shall use the Group Cipher Key indicated by the Group Cipher Key Number IE for deciphering on the VGCS or VBS channel. If these IE are not present, no ciphering is applied on the VGCS or VBS channel.

Mobile stations not supporting VGCS listening or VBS listening shall ignore this information element.


9.1.7.3	UTRAN Freq List

This IE should only be sent to UTRAN capable mobile station. This information element is used to describe the UTRAN frequencies used by the network.


9.1.7.4	Cell Channel Description

This IE may be present if the following conditions are satisfied:

  -	the CHANNEL RELEASE message is ordering the release of the uplink to the originator or to the talker of a VGCS call over a dedicated channel; and

  -	the Group Channel Description IE is included in the message and is describing a hopping channel.

It shall not be included in any other case.

Mobile stations not supporting VGCS talking or VGCS originating shall ignore this information element if present.


9.1.7.5	VGCS Ciphering Parameters

This information element is only applicable to a VGCS mobile station. It is only included if the group channel is ciphered.


9.1.7.6	Talker Identity

This information element is only applicable to a VGCS talking subscriber. Mobile stations not supporting VGCS talking shall ignore this information element if present.


9.1.7.7	Talker Priority Status

This information element is only applicable to a VGCS talking subscriber. Mobile stations not supporting VGCS talking shall ignore this information element if present.


9.1.7.8	VGCS AMR Configuration

This information element is only applicable to a VGCS talking subscriber. Mobile stations not supporting VGCS talking shall ignore this information element if present.


9.1.7.9	Individual priorities

This information element is sent to provide MS-specific priorities for priority-based cell reselection. The individual priorities shall override the priorities received through system information or individual priorities received previously. The timer T3230 is used to control the availability of the individual priorities.


9.1.8	Channel request

This message is sent in random mode on the RACH. It does not follow the basic format. The possible formats are presented directly below, without reference to information fields. The order of bit transmission is defined in 3GPP TS 44.004.

The message is only one octet long, coded as shown in figure 9.1.8.1 and table 9.1.8.1.

  NOTE 1:	Examples of these procedures are: IMSI detach, Short Message Service (SMS), Supplementary Service management, Location Services, sending of application-specific data.

  NOTE 2:	If such messages are received by a network, an SDCCH shall be allocated.

  NOTE 2a:	If such messages are received by a network, an SDCCH may be allocated.

  NOTE 2b:	This value shall not be used by the mobile station on RACH. If such message is received by the network, it may be ignored. The value is used by the network to answer to a 11 bits EGPRS Packet Channel request.

  NOTE 2c:	If the MS is Location Updating as part of a CS Fallback Mobile Originating call setup then the MS shall instead use the appropriate Originating call Establishment cause value. If the MS is Location Updating as part of a CS Fallback for other Mobile Originating services (e.g. USSD or Location Services) then the MS may either use the Establishment cause for the other service or the Establishment cause for Location Updating. If the MS is Location Updating as part of a Mobile Terminating CS Fallback procedure then the MS shall instead use the appropriate Answer to paging Establishment cause value as specified below Table 9.1.8.2.

In case of a CHANNEL REQUEST triggered within a CS Fallback procedure, see 3GPP TS 23.272, the CHANNEL REQUEST message content shall be based on the relevant information provided in the paging notification received in source RAT, see 3GPP TS 24.301, as for a Paging Indication (see  Table 9.1.8.2) set to:

  -	"TCH/H or TCH/F" if the mobile station is paged for a speech call or for any other CS service requiring a traffic channel,

  -	"SDCCH" if the mobile station is paged for a supplementary service transaction, a terminating location services request or any other CS service that can be completed with an SDCCH,

  -	"Any channel" otherwise (including where no relevant information is provided in the paging notification).

  NOTE 3:	The Paging Indication is provided by the Channel Needed IE (or the Channel Needed field) associated with the page which triggered the sending of the CHANNEL REQUEST message.

  NOTE 4:	In some cases the established connection will be used only to allow a default rejection mechanism to take place (typically the mobile station will send a RELEASE COMPLETE message with cause #88 "incompatible destination" as an answer to the incoming SETUP message).

  NOTE 5:	In this sub-clause, "dual rate capability" means that the MS supports both full rate and half-rate channels at least for the signalling channel mode. In addition, it may support either speech channel mode, or data channel modes, or both on half-rate channels.

9.1.12e.1	(void)


9.1.12e.2	RR Packet Uplink Assignment and RR Packet Downlink Assignment IEs

These information elements are optional, but at least one of them shall be present. With the enhanced DTM CS establishment procedure the network may omit both packet assignment information elements, see 3GPP TS 44.060.


9.1.12e.3	MultiRate configuration

This information element appears if the Channel mode IE indicates a multi-rate speech codec, and if the assigned configuration is new, i.e. is different from the configuration of a previously allocated channel in the cell. If the Channel mode IE indicates a multi-rate speech codec, and the MultiRateconfiguration IE is not included, then the mobile station shall assume that the old multi-rate configuration is still valid, if existing.


9.1.12e.4	Ciphering Mode Setting

If this information element is omitted, the mode of ciphering is not changed after the mobile station has switched to the assigned channels. This information element shall not be included if support for this IE has not been indicated by the mobile station in the Mobile Station Classmark 3 IE (see 3GPP TS 24.008).


9.1.12e.5	(void)


9.1.12e.6	Mobile Allocation and Frequency List

If the Description of the CS Channel IE indicates frequency hopping, one and only one of the following information elements shall be present:

  -	Mobile Allocation IE

  -	Frequency List IE

If the Description of the CS Channel IE does not indicate frequency hopping, then any of the Mobile Allocation or Frequency List IEs if present shall be considered as an unnecessary IE in the message.


9.1.12e.7	Mobile Allocation C2, Frequency List C2, Channel Description C2 and Description of the Downlink Packet Channel Assignment Type 2

These information elements may be included to assign packet resources in Dual Transfer Mode on a second radio frequency channel (which does not include the dedicated resource) to a mobile station supporting Downlink Dual Carrier (see 3GPP TS 44.060).

If the Channel Description C2 IE is present, the Description of the Downlink Packet Channel Assignment Type 2 IE shall be present and provides the description of the downlink packet resources for both carriers C1 and C2. In this case, the Description of the Downlink Packet Channel Assignment IE shall not be included.

If the Channel Description C2 IE is present and indicates frequency hopping, one and only one of the following information elements shall be present:

  -	Mobile Allocation C2 IE

  -	Frequency List C2 IE

If the Channel Description C2 IE is not included then the Description of the Downlink Packet Channel Assignment Type 2 IE if present shall be considered as an unnecessary IE in the message.

If the Channel Description C2 IE is not included or is included but does not indicate frequency hopping, then any of the Mobile Allocation C2 or Frequency List C2 IEs if present shall be considered as an unnecessary IE in the message.


9.1.12e.8	Extended TSC Set

If the message is sent to a mobile station that indicates support for extended TSC sets (see 3GPP TS 24.008 [79]) this information element may be included to provide TSC related information for the assigned radio resources. In the absence of this information element the TSC related information provided by the Channel Description IE and Channel Description 3 IE shall apply.


9.1.12f	DTM Assignment Failure

This message is sent on the main DCCH from the mobile station to the network to indicate that an abnormal case as explained in the clauses 3.4.22.1.1.5, 3.4.22.3.3 and 3.4.23.2.3. See table 9.1.12f.1.

9.1.13.1	Cell Channel Description

If it does not appear, the cell channel description is assumed to be unchanged.


9.1.13.2	Carrier Indication

This information element shall only be included if the mobile station is in dual transfer mode, has been assigned packet resources on two carriers, and the Frequency Redefinition message is applicable only to one carrier. The IE shall indicate which carrier the message applies to. In this case the frequency parameters applicable to the indicated carrier are provided in the Channel Description IE and the Mobile Allocation IE.


9.1.13.3	Mobile Allocation C2 and Channel Description C2

These information element shall be included if the Frequency Redefinition message is used to change the frequency parameters for both carriers being used by a downlink dual carrier capable mobile station in dual transfer mode (in this case the Carrier Indication IE is not present). The frequency parameters applicable to carrier 1 are provided in the Channel Description and the Mobile Allocation IEs, while the frequency parameters applicable to carrier 2 are provided in the Channel Description C2 and the Mobile Allocation C2 IEs.

Either the Carrier Indication IE, or the two Mobile Allocation C2 and Channel Description C2 IEs shall be present, not all three IEs.


9.1.13.4	Extended TSC Set

If the message is sent to a mobile station that indicates support for extended TSC sets (see 3GPP TS 24.008 [79]) this information element may be included to provide TSC related information for the assigned radio resources. In the absence of this information element the TSC related information provided by the Channel Description IE and Channel Description 3 IE shall apply.

9.1.15.1	Synchronization Indication

If this information element does not appear, the assumed value is "non-synchronized".


9.1.15.2	Mode of the First Channel (Channel Set 1) and Mode of Channel Set "X" (2=<X<=8)

If this information element is not present the channel mode of the previously allocated channel or channels for Channel Set "X" (1=<X<=8) shall be assumed.

If Channel Set "X" is not defined for the configuration, the Mode of Channel Set "X" IE shall be considered as an IE unnecessary in the message.

  NOTE:	Sub-clause 3.4.4.1 defines cases when one or several Mode of Channel Set "X" IEs shall be included in the message.


9.1.15.3	Description of the Second Channel

These information element appear if the mobile station carries two connections (on two dedicated channels, for the TCH/H+TCH/H configuration).

The connection using the channel previously defined in the Description of the First Channel IE of an ASSIGNMENT COMMAND or HANDOVER COMMAND message shall use the channel defined in the first channel description IE of the HANDOVER COMMAND message defining the new configuration.

The channel described in the Description of the First Channel IE carries the main DCCH. The SACCH used is the one associated with that channel.


9.1.15.4	Mode of the Second Channel

If the Description of the Second Channel IE is not present and the information element is present it shall be considered as an IE unnecessary in the message.

This element appears at least when the channel mode is changed for the channel defined in the Description of the Second Channel information element.


9.1.15.5	Frequency Channel Sequence, Frequency List, Frequency short list and Mobile Allocation, after time.

If at least one of the channel descriptions for after time indicates frequency hopping, one and only one of the following information elements shall be present:

  -	Frequency Channel Sequence, after time;

  -	Frequency list, after time;

  -	Frequency Short List, after time;

  -	Mobile Allocation, after time.

If neither of the Channel Description IEs indicate frequency hopping, if they are not required for the decoding of Channel Description IEs for before time, and if any of the four information elements are present they shall be considered as IEs unnecessary in the message.

The Frequency Channel Sequence information element shall not be used unless all the ARFCNs that it indicates are in the P-GSM band.


9.1.15.6	Starting Time

The starting time information element is included when the network wants the mobile station to change the frequency parameters of the channels more or less at the moment a change of channel occurs. In this case a number of information elements may be included to give the frequency parameters to be used before the starting time.

The starting time information element refers to the new cell time.

If the starting time information element is present and none of the information elements referring to before the starting time are present, the mobile station waits and accesses the channels at the indicated time.

If the starting time information element is present and at least one of the information elements referring to before the starting time is present, the mobile station does not wait for the indicated time and accesses the channel using the frequency parameters for before the starting time.

If the starting time information element is not present and some of the information elements referring to before the starting time is present, these information elements shall be considered as IEs unnecessary in the message.

If the description of the first channel, before time IE is not present, the channel description to apply for before the time, if needed, is given by the description of the first channel, after time IE.

If the description of the second channel, after time IE is present, the description of the second channel, before time IE not present, and a description of the configuration for before the time needed, the channel configuration before the starting time is nevertheless of two traffic channels, and the channel description to apply to the second channel before the starting time is given by the description of the second channel, after time IE.

If the starting time IE is present and at least one of the channel descriptions for before the starting time indicates frequency hopping, one and only one of the following information elements may be present and applies before the starting time to all assigned channels:

  -	Mobile Allocation, before time IE;

  -	Frequency Short list, before time IE;

  -	Frequency list, before time IE;

  -	Frequency channel sequence, before time IE.

If the starting time IE is present and at least one of the channel descriptions for before the starting time indicates frequency hopping, and none of the above mentioned IE is present, a frequency list for after the starting time must be present (see sub-clause 9.1.2.4), and this list applies also for the channels before the starting time.


9.1.15.7	Reference cell frequency list

If any of the mobile allocation information elements is present, then the cell channel description IE must be present. It is used to decode the mobile allocation IEs in the message.

In addition, if no information elements pertaining to before the starting time is present in the message, the frequency list defined by the cell channel description IE is used to decode the mobile allocation IEs in later messages received in the new cell until reception of a new reference cell frequency list or the new cell is left.


9.1.15.8	Real Time Difference

This information element shall appear if the Synchronization Indication information element indicates a pseudo-synchronous handover otherwise it shall be considered as an unnecessary information element.


9.1.15.9	Timing Advance

This information element shall appear if the "synchronization indication" element indicates a presynchronized handover. If not included for a presynchronized handover, then the default value as defined in 3GPP TS 45.010 shall be used. For other types of handover it shall be considered as an unnecessary information element.


9.1.15.10	Cipher Mode Setting

If this information element is omitted, the mode of ciphering is not changed after the mobile station has switched to the assigned channel.

In the case of inter-RAT or inter-mode handover to GERAN A/Gb mode, the HANDOVER COMMAND message shall always contain the cipher mode setting IE (see sub-clause 3.4.4.1).

Only applicable for mobile stations supporting VGCS talking:

The cipher mode setting IE shall not be included if the HANDOVER COMMAND message is sent on a VGCS channel or on a dedicated channel for a handover to a VGCS channel.

The cipher mode setting IE shall be included if the HANDOVER COMMAND message is sent on a ciphered VGCS channel for a handover to a dedicated channel. If the information element is not present, the MS shall use ciphering mode "no ciphering" on the assigned channel.


9.1.15.11	VGCS target mode indication

This information element is identified as "comprehension required". Only mobile stations supporting "VGCS talking" are required to accept the presence of the element. The presence of the element shall trigger an exception handling if received by a mobile station not supporting "VGCS talking".

This IE indicates which mode is to be used on the new channel (i.e. dedicated mode or group transmit mode). If this information element is not present, the mode shall be the same as on the previous channel.

The IE also indicates the group cipher key number for the group cipher key to be used on the new channel or if the new channel is non ciphered. If the information element is not present, the ciphering mode shall be the same as on the previous channel.

  NOTE:	A mobile station supporting VGCS Talking shall not consider a syntactical error if this IE is present and the channel mode is not speech.


9.1.15.12	Description of the multislot allocation

This information element is included if so indicated by the channel type and TDMA offset field in the Channel Description information element and is used to assign channels that do not carry a main signalling link in a multislot configuration. It indicates how the used timeslots are divided into separate channel sets.

If the Channel Description IE does not require the presence the information element it shall be considered as an IE unnecessary in the message.

If multislot configuration is indicated by the Channel Description IE but the Multislot Allocation IE is not present, all channels in the configuration belong to one channel set, "Channel Set 1".

  NOTE:	As a change of timeslot number cannot occur for the channel described for after the starting time, the Multislot Allocation IE does not have to be included more than once.


9.1.15.13	MultiRateconfiguration

This information element appears if the Mode of the First Channel indicates a multi-rate speech codec, and if the assigned configuration is new, i.e. it is different from the MultiRateconfiguration used in the serving cell.

In the case of a handover from a GERAN cell, if the Mode of the First Channel indicates a multi-rate speech codec, and this IE is not included, then the mobile station shall assume that the MultiRateconfiguration has not changed.

In the case of an intersystem handover to GERAN, if the Mode of the First Channel indicates a multi-rate speech codec, this IE shall be included. If not included in this case, the mobile station shall act as defined in sub-clause 3.4.4.1.


9.1.15.14	Dynamic ARFCN Mapping

This information element should only be included if the network supports dynamic ARFCN mapping and there is a need to define new dynamic ARFCN mapping, e.g. at handover to another PLMN or from another RAT to GSM. This information replaces any previously received information about dynamic ARFCN mapping. After returning to idle mode or packet idle mode, the mobile station shall acquire new dynamic ARFCN mapping information, except for the cases specified in sub-clause 3.2.2.1 (SI15). This mapping shall apply to any ARFCN used in the same message.

  NOTE:	If this information nelement is received with a value part length equal to zero or a value part that does not contain any dynamic ARFCN mapping, any previously received information about dynamic ARFCN mapping is deleted.


9.1.15.15	VGCS Target cell Ciphering information

Only mobile stations supporting "VGCS talking" have to accept the presence of the element. The presence of the element shall trigger an exception handling if received by a mobile station not supporting "VGCS talking".

9.1.17.1	PS Cause

The PS Cause IE shall only be included in the case of DTM Handover where there is an error in the packet resources described in the DTM HANDOVER COMMAND message.


9.1.18	Immediate assignment

This message is sent on the CCCH or encapsulated in the PACKET CS COMMAND message on the PACCH (see 3GPP TS 44.060) by the network to the mobile station in idle mode to change the channel configuration to a dedicated configuration while staying in the same cell or to the mobile station in packet idle mode to change the channel configuration to either an uplink or a downlink packet data channel configuration, or to provide the configuration of an MBMS session in the cell. In addition, this message is sent on the CCCH to a mobile station in packet idle mode when it has sent an EGPRS MULTILATERATION REQUEST message indicating ‘RLC Data Block method’ or ‘Page Response for Positioning Event’ (see table 9.1.18.1) or indicating ‘Access Burst method’ or ‘Extended Access Burst method’ (see sub-clause 3.5.2.1.2, sub-clause 3.11 and table 9.1.18.1a).

The L2 pseudo length of this message is the sum of lengths of all information elements present in the message except the IA Rest Octets and L2 Pseudo Length information elements.

9.1.18.0a	Dedicated mode or TBF

A mobile station not supporting GPRS may ignore the contents of this information element and regard it as an unnecessary IE. Such mobile station shall assume that this message assigns a dedicated mode resource.

If the Dedicated mode or TBF IE indicates that neither a TBF nor a dedicated resource has been assigned (see sub-clause 10.5.2.25b) then the IA Rest Octets IE shall be coded using the ‘LL’ option and indicate either a ‘0’ or a ‘1’ for the Compressed_Inter_RAT_HO_INFO_IND field (see sub-clause 10.5.2.16). In this case a mobile station that has enabled PEO and has sent an EGPRS MULTILATERATION REQUEST message indicating ‘Access Burst’ or ‘Extended Access Burst’ method (see sub-clause 3.5.2.1.2 and sub-clause 3.11) shall ignore the Compressed_Inter_RAT_HO_INFO_IND field and examine the Request Reference 1, Request Reference 2, Request Reference 3, and Request Reference 4 information elements (as necessary) in attempt to find an Immediate Assignment message (see Table 9.1.18.1a) that matches its transmitted EGPRS MULTILATERATION REQUEST message (see sub-clause 10.5.2.87). A mobile station that has enabled PEO and has sent an EGPRS MULTILATERATION REQUEST message indicating ‘RLC Data Block method’ or ‘Page Response for Positioning Event’ shall ignore an Immediate Assignment message where the Dedicated mode or TBF IE indicates neither a TBF nor a dedicated resource has been assigned.


9.1.18.0b	Channel Description

If the Dedicated mode or TBF IE indicates that the message assigns a dedicated mode resource, the mobile station shall consider this information element present in the message.


9.1.18.0c	Packet Channel Description

If the Dedicated mode or TBF IE indicates that the message assigns a Temporary Block Flow (TBF), the mobile station shall consider this information element present in the message. If the Dedicated mode or TBF IE indicates that this message is the first of two in a two-message assignment of an uplink or downlink TBF, the mobile station shall ignore the contents of this information element and regard it as an unnecessary IE.


9.1.18.0d	Request Reference

If this message is used in an assignment of a downlink TBF, the network shall code this information element, e.g. by using a suitably offset frame number, such that the resource reference cannot be confused with any CHANNEL REQUEST message sent by a mobile station.

If the IA Rest Octets IE indicates that this message is the second message of a two-message assignment of an uplink or downlink TBF, this information element shall have the same contents as the first message of the assignment.

When set to the value '0111 1111', the RA information of the Request Reference IE indicates that an Extended RA field may be included in the IA Rest Octets. The mobile station shall use the information in the Extended RA field to identify the Immediate Assignment message corresponding to an EGPRS Packet Channel Request message. If the Extended RA field is not included, the mobile station shall assume that the Immediate Assignment message does not correspond to the EGPRS Packet Channel Request message.

A mobile station has enabled PEO and has sent an EGPRS MULTILATERATION REQUEST message indicating ‘Access Burst’ method or ‘Extended Access Burst’ method (see sub-clause 3.5.2.1.2 and sub-clause 3.11) shall ignore this field and instead examine the Request Reference 1, Request Reference 2, Request Reference 3 and Request Reference 4 information elements (as necessary) in attempt to find an IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT message (see Table 9.1.18.1a) that matches its transmitted message (see sub-clause 10.5.2.87).

When the mobile station receives the IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT message encapsulated in the PACKET CS COMMAND message on the PACCH (see 3GPP TS 44.060), it shall ignore the contents of this information element and regard it as an unnecessary IE.


9.1.18.0e	Timing Advance

If the IA Rest Octets IE indicates that this message is the second message of a two-message assignment of an uplink or downlink TBF, the mobile station shall ignore the contents of this information element and regard it as an unnecessary IE.


9.1.18.1	Mobile Allocation

If this message assigns a dedicated mode resource and the Channel Description IE does not indicate frequency hopping, the length indicator of this information element shall be set to zero, and the mobile station shall consider the IE as an unnecessary IE.

If this message assigns a TBF and the Packet Channel Description IE does not indicate frequency hopping or if it uses indirect encoding of a hopping RF channel configuration, the length indicator of this information element shall be set to zero, and the mobile station shall consider the IE as an unnecessary IE.


9.1.18.2	Starting Time

This information element appears if e.g. a frequency change is in progress.

If this message is used in an assignment of an uplink or downlink TBF, the mobile station shall ignore the contents of the Starting Time information element if included and consider it as an unnecessary IE.


9.1.18.3	IA Rest Octets (Frequency parameters, before time)

The sum of the length of this IE and the L2 Pseudo Length of the message equals 22.

If the starting time IE is present but not the frequency parameters, before time construction, the mobile stations must wait until the starting time before accessing the channel.

If the starting time IE is present and the Channel Description IE does not indicate frequency hopping the mobile station shall consider the frequency parameters, before time construction as unnecessary in the message and the mobile must wait until the starting time before accessing the channel.

If the starting time IE is not present, the mobile station shall consider the frequency parameters, before time construction as unnecessary in the message.


9.1.18.4	IA Rest Octets (assignment of uplink or downlink TBF)

If the Dedicated mode or TBF IE indicates that this message is used in an assignment of a TBF, this information element shall contain a Packet Uplink Assignment, Packet Downlink Assignment, Second Part Packet Assignment construction or Multiple Blocks Packet Downlink Assignment construction.

If the Dedicated mode or TBF IE indicates that this message assigns a dedicated mode resource, but not that the mobile station is identified in the IA Rest Octets IE information element, the mobile station shall consider the Packet Uplink Assignment, Packet Downlink Assignment, Second Part Packet Assignment and Multiple Blocks Packet Downlink Assignment constructions as unnecessary in the message.


9.1.18.5	Extended TSC Set

If the message is sent on the PACCH to a mobile station that indicates support for extended TSC sets (see 3GPP TS 24.008 [79]) this information element may be included to provide TSC related information for the assigned radio resources. In the absence of this information element the TSC related information provided by the Channel Description IE and Packet Channel Description IE shall apply.


9.1.18.6	Request Reference N

A mobile station that has enabled PEO and has sent an EGPRS MULTILATERATION REQUEST message indicating the ‘Access Burst’ method or ‘Extended Access Burst’ method shall ignore the Request Reference information element and shall instead examine the Request Reference 1, Request Reference 2, Request Reference 3 and Request Reference 4 information elements (as necessary) in attempt to find an IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT message (see Table 9.1.18.1a) that matches its transmitted EGPRS MULTILATERATION REQUEST message (see sub-clause 10.5.2.30 and sub-clause 10.5.2.87).

A mobile station that has enabled PEO and has sent an EGPRS MULTILATERATION REQUEST message indicating the ‘RLC Data Block’ method or ‘Page Response for Positioning Event’ shall only examine the Request information element in attempt to find an IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT message (see Table 9.1.18.1a) that matches its transmitted EGPRS MULTILATERATION REQUEST message (i.e. it shall ignore all instances of the Request Reference N information element if included).


9.1.18a	(void)


9.1.18b	Immediate packet assignment

This message is sent on the CCCH by the network to multiple mobile stations in idle mode to assign either an uplink or a downlink packet data channel configuration in the cell. In addition, this message is sent on the CCCH to a mobile station in packet idle mode when it has sent an EGPRS MULTILATERATION REQUEST message indicating ‘RLC Data Block method’ or ‘Page Response for Positioning Event’ (see table 9.1.18.1) or indicating ‘Access Burst method’ or ‘Extended Access Burst method’ (see sub-clause 3.5.2.1.2, sub-clause 3.11 and table 9.1.18.1a).

See table 9.1.18b.1.

The L2 pseudo length of this message is the sum of lengths of all information elements present in the message except the IPA Rest Octets and L2 Pseudo Length information elements.

  NOTE:	The network should take into account limitations of certain mobile stations to understand IMMEDIATE PACKET ASSIGNMENT message as these mobile stations may not be able to decode the Page Mode information element.

  NOTE:	Index 1 refers to the first mobile station, index 2 refers to the second mobile station.


9.1.19.1	Unnecessary IEs

A mobile station which reacts on the request reference 1 shall consider all information elements as unnecessary IEs except for Requests Reference 1, Channel Description 1, Timing advance 1, Starting Time and if Channel Description 1 IE indicates frequency hopping mobile allocation.

A mobile station which reacts on the request reference 2 shall consider all information elements as unnecessary IE except Requests Reference 2, Channel Description 2, Timing advance 2, Starting Time and if channel description 2 IE indicates frequency hopping mobile allocation.

A mobile station in idle mode shall consider all information elements as unnecessary IEs except for the Page Mode IE.


9.1.19.2	Mobile Allocation

If both channel description IE do not indicate frequency hopping, the length indicator shall be set to zero.


9.1.19.3	Starting Time

This information element appears if a frequency change is in progress. If included the starting time is common to the two referenced mobile stations.


9.1.19.4	Maximum message length

As the maximum length of the resulting layer 3 data cannot exceed 22 octets, it is not possible to use this message type if the total length of the value part of the Mobile Allocation plus, optionally, the length of the Starting Time IE exceeds 5 octets. In this case it is necessary to use the IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT message.


9.1.19.5	IAX Rest Octets

  NOTE:	Index 1 refers to the first mobile station, index 2 refers to the second MS and so on.


9.1.20.1	Use of the indexes

A request reference information element and the following wait indication information element refer to the same mobile station. So it is possible to reject up to four channel requests with this message.


9.1.20.2	Filling of the message

If necessary the request reference information element and the wait indication information element should be duplicated to fill the message.


9.1.20.2a	Request Reference

When set to the value '0111 1111', the RA information of the Request Reference i IE indicates that an Extended RA i field may be included in the IAR Rest Octets. The mobile station shall use the information in the Extended RA i field to identify the Immediate Assignment Reject message corresponding to an EGPRS Packet Channel Request message. If the Extended RA i field is not included, the mobile station shall assume that the Request Reference i IE does not correspond to the EGPRS Packet Channel Request message.

When the mobile station receives the IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT REJECT message encapsulated in the PACKET CS COMMAND message on the PACCH (see 3GPP TS 44.060), it shall ignore the contents of all the Request Reference i IEs and regard them as unnecessary IEs.


9.1.20.3	Wait Indication

When IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT REJECT message is for RR connection establisment then this IE contains timeout value for T3122. If IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT REJECT message is for TBF establisment for GPRS MS then this IE contain timeout value for T3142.

When the mobile station receives the IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT REJECT message encapsulated in the PACKET CS COMMAND message on the PACCH (see 3GPP TS 44.060), it shall ignore the contents of the Wait Indication 2, 3 and 4 IEs and regard them as unnecessary IEs.


9.1.20.4	IAR Rest Octets

The sum of the length of this IE and the L2 Pseudo Length of the message equals 22.


9.1.21	Measurement report

This message is sent on the SACCH by the mobile station to the network to report measurement results about the dedicated channel and about neighbour cells. See table 9.1.21.1.

9.1.21a	Notification/FACCH

The understanding of this message is only required for mobile stations supporting VGCS listening or VBS listening.

This message is sent on the main DCCH, in unacknowledged mode using the RR short protocol discriminator by the network to notify the mobile stations in dedicated mode or in on-going voice broadcast calls or voice group calls on other voice broadcast calls or voice group calls in that cell.

Notification/FACCH messages for VBS or VGCS calls are differentiated by a flag in the call reference.

It is possible in the case of a notification for a ciphered VGCS/VBS call that the notification cannot be described within one Notification/FACCH message. In this case a second message may be used to contain the group call reference, a VSTK_RAND, possibly the CELL_GLOBAL_COUNT and bit 22 of COUNT. The group channel description shall be in the first segment.

Mobile stations not supporting VGCS listening or VBS listening shall ignore this message.

<mobile identity>

This field is syntactically and semantically equivalent to octet 2-n of the Mobile Identity information element. See sub-clause 10.5.1.4.

<channel first>

This field is syntactically and semantically equivalent to bits 1 and 2 of the Channel Needed information element. See sub-clause 10.5.2.8.

<eMLPP priority>

This field is coded as the <Priority1> field in the P1 Rest Octets information element. See sub-clause 10.5.2.23.

<VSTK_RAND>

The 36-bit value that is used for derivation of a short term key VSTK, as defined in 3GPP TS 43.020. This parameter is only provided when the group call reference is present and the group call is ciphered.

<CELL_GLOBAL_COUNT>

This field contains the value of the CELL_GLOBAL_COUNT that is used by the VGCS/VBS ciphering mechanism. The value is incremented by one (modulo 4) each time bit 22 of COUNT ( defined in 3GPP TS 43.020) changes from ‘1’ to ‘0’.

<B22_COUNT>

This field contains the value of bit 22 of COUNT (see 3GPP TS43.020) corresponding to the moment when the value of <CELL_GLOBAL_COUNT> was valid.

<Priority Uplink Access>

Indicates the method to be used for priority uplink access.

Bit
L	RACH access
H	Group Channel.

<Emergency Ind>

This field indicates the status of the emergency mode for the group call.

L	Emergency mode not set.

H	Emergency mode set.

<AMR Config>

This field indicates the set of AMR codec modes to be used on a group channel using speech version 3. It is coded as the binary representation of the parameter Config-NB-Code of one of the preferred AMR configurations defined in 3GPP TS 28.062 [92].

<Paging Cause>

This field indicates whether the paging contained in the field ‘Paging Information’ is for a mobile terminating call, USSD or short message. Mobile stations shall ignore the contents of this field when the notification does not contain paging information.

bit
2 1
0 0	Paging is for a mobile terminating call
0 1	Paging is for a mobile terminating short message.
1 0	Paging is for a USSD
1 1	Spare – if received, mobile shall treat as for a mobile terminating call

<SMS Data Confidentiality Ind>

This field shall be included periodically (the frequency with which this field is included is implementation dependent) if the network supports the transfer of mobile originated point-to-point short messages via the group call channel. The value is provided by the network (see 3GPP TS 43.068).

If this field is not present the most recently received value in either a Notification/FACCH message or Notification/NCH message shall be used. If no previous value has been received, a default value of "1" shall be assumed.

0	SMS data confidentiality not required.

1	SMS data confidentiality required.

<SMS Guaranteed Privacy Ind>

This field shall be included periodically (the frequency with which this field is included is implementation dependent) if the network supports the transfer of mobile originated point-to-point short messages via the group call channel. The value is provided by the network (see 3GPP TS 43.068).

If this field is not present the most recently received value in either a Notification/FACCH message or Notification/NCH message shall be used. If no previous value has been received,  a default value of "1" shall be assumed.

0	SMS guaranteed privacy not required.

1	SMS guaranteed privacy required.

9.1.21b	Notification/NCH

The understanding of this message is only required for mobile stations supporting VGCS listening or VBS listening.

This message is sent on the NCH by the network to notify mobile stations of VBS or VGCS calls in the current cell. The VBS or VGCS calls are identified by their broadcast call reference or group call reference, respectively. For each reference, the corresponding VBS or VGCS call channel may be indicated. See table 9.1.21b.1.

Notification/NCH messages for VBS or VGCS calls are differentiated by a flag in the call reference.

The L2 pseudo length of this message has a value one.

It is possible in the case of a notification for a ciphered VGCS/VBS call that the notification cannot be described within one message. In this case a second message may be used to contain the group call reference, a VSTK_RAND, and possibly CELL_GLOBAL_COUNT. The Group channel description shall be included in the first segment.

Mobile stations not supporting VGCS listening or VBS listening shall ignore this message.

9.1.21f.2	(void)


9.1.21f.3	Frequency List C2, Mobile Allocation C2 and Description of the Downlink Packet Channel Assignment Type 2

These information elements may be included to assign packet resources on a second radio frequency channel, which does not include the dedicated resource, to a mobile station supporting Downlink Dual Carrier (see 3GPP TS 44.060).

If the Channel Description C2 IE is present, the Description of the Downlink Packet Channel Assignment Type 2 IE shall be present and provides the description of the downlink packet resources for both carriers C1 and C2. In this case, the Description of the Downlink Packet Channel Assignment IE shall not be included.

If the Channel Description C2 IE is present and indicates frequency hopping, one and only one of the following information elements shall be present:

  -	Mobile Allocation C2 IE

  -	Frequency List C2 IE

If the Mobile allocation C2 IE is present, then the network must ensure that the mobile station has received in a previous message the proper reference cell frequency list.

If the Channel Description C2 IE is not included then the Description of the Downlink Packet Channel Assignment Type 2 IE if present shall be considered as an unnecessary IE in the message.

If the Channel Description C2 IE is not included or is included but does not indicate frequency hopping, then any of the Mobile Allocation C2 or Frequency List C2 IEs if present shall be considered as an unnecessary IE in the message.


9.1.21f.4	Extended TSC Set

If the message is sent to a mobile station that indicates support for extended TSC sets (see 3GPP TS 24.008 [79]) this information element may be included to provide TSC related information for the assigned radio resources. In the absence of this information element the TSC related information provided by the Channel Description 3 IE shall apply.

9.1.22	Paging request type 1

This message is sent on the CCCH by the network and may identify up to two mobile stations. It may be sent to a mobile station in idle mode to trigger channel access. It may be sent to a mobile station in packet idle mode to transfer MM information (i.e. trigger of cell update procedure) or to perform an MBMS pre-notification or an MBMS notification. It may be sent to mobile stations in idle mode to transfer the segments of an ETWS Primary Notification message. The mobile stations are identified by their TMSI/P-TMSI or IMSI. If an MBMS (pre)notification is included in this message, the corresponding TMGI and, if available, MBMS Session Identity shall be included within Mobile Identity 1 or 2 IEs, or if Mobile Identity 1 and 2 IEs are not available, within the P1 Rest Octets. The remaining information pertinent to an MBMS notification may only be included within the P1 Rest Octets. See table 9.1.22.1.

The L2 pseudo length of this message is the sum of lengths of all information elements present in the message except the P1 Rest Octets and L2 Pseudo Length information elements.

The P1 Rest Octets may contain a notification for a VGCS/VBS call or a segment of an ETWS Primary Notification message.

It is possible in the case of a notification for a ciphered VGCS/VBS call that the notification cannot be described within one message. When the notification is segmented across two messages, the first message shall contain the group channel description whilst the second message can be used to contain the group call reference, the VSTK_RAND and possibly the CELL_GLOBAL_COUNT. The second message shall be sent at the next but one PCH block after the PCH block containing the first message.

|BSIC, base station identity code is a 9 bit field identifying the base station (see 3GPP TS 45.002).                                |
|T1' and T2', these are 2 parts of the reduced TDMA frame number per quarter hyperframe (RFNQH) as specified in 3GPP TS 45.002[32].  |
|RACH Access Control is a 1 bit field, is only applicable to mobile stations that have selected CC1 on both the uplink and downlink  |
|(i.e. all other mobile stations shall ignore this field) and is coded as follows:                                                   |
|0: A mobile station that has selected CC1 in both uplink and downlink shall use the EC_CCCH_GROUP (i.e. one of timeslots 1, 3, 5 or |
|7 - see 3GPP TS 45.002 [32]) to transmit the EC PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST                                                              |
|1: A mobile station that has selected CC1 in both uplink and downlink shall use timeslot 0 to transmit the EC PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST|
|EC-BCCH CHANGE MARK is a 3 bit field that operates as a modulo 8 counter and is therefore incremented each time the content of any  |
|of the EC SYSTEM INFORMATION messages is changed. An exception is when PLMN specific access barring is enabled (see sub-clause      |
|3.5.2a) for a given set of PLMNs and changes are made only to the EC_Access_Control_Class field or the Exception_Report_Status field|
|corresponding to this set of PLMNs in which case the EC-BCCH CHANGE MARK field is not incremented.                                  |
|Implicit Reject Status is a 2 bit field and is coded as follows:                                                                    |
|00: no barring                                                                                                                      |
|01: roamer barring enabled for all mobile stations that are neither in their HPLMN nor in a PLMN that is equivalent to it (see 3GPP |
|TS 22.011 [6]).                                                                                                                     |
|10: roamer  barring enabled for all mobile stations that are neither in the PLMN listed as most preferred PLMN of the country where |
|the MS is roaming in the operator-defined PLMN selector list on the SIM/USIM, nor in their HPLMN nor in an PLMN that is equivalent  |
|to it (see 3GPP TS 22.011 [6]).                                                                                                     |
|11: all mobile stations barred. Only applies to MS with Access Class 0 to 9 (see 3GPP TS 22.011)                                    |
|IMM CGI is a 3 bit field that provides the IMM Cell Group Identifier (see subclause 9.1.43q) and is coded as follows:               |
|000: IMM Cell Group Definition is not broadcasted or not supported in the cell.                                                     |
|001: Cell belongs to IMM Cell Group Identity 1.                                                                                     |
|010: Cell belongs to IMM Cell Group Identity 2.                                                                                     |
|…                                                                                                                                   |

|IMM CM is a 2 bit field that identifies the change mark of the IMM Cell Group (see subclause 9.1.43q) and is coded as follows, if   |
|IMM CGI has a different value from "000":                                                                                           |
|00:  IMM Change Mark value is 0                                                                                                     |
|01:  IMM Change Mark value is 1                                                                                                     |
|10:  IMM Change Mark value is 2                                                                                                     |

|Otherwise, if IMM CGI has the value "000", these bits shall be ignored.                                                             |

|The purpose of these fields is to indicate the number of individual message instances within the sequence of EC SI 1 messages and to assign an    |
|index to identify each instance. The EC SI 1_INDEX field is binary coded, range 0 to 3, and provides an index to identify an individual EC SI 1   |
|message instance. The EC SI 1_COUNT field is binary coded, range 0 to 3, and provides the value of the highest indexed message instance in the    |
|sequence of EC SI 1 messages.                                                                                                                     |

|This field contains a bitmap indicating the status of each EC SI message broadcasted in the cell. Whenever the content of a given EC SI message is|
|modified the associated bit position within the bitmap (EC SI N) is changed to "0" or "1" depending on its previous value; N = 1, 2, 3, 4.        |
|An Overflow Control bit (bit 1 in the bitmap) indicates whether one or more of the EC SI messages have changed more than once during a given time |
|period (see sub-clause 3.10.4).                                                                                                                   |

9.1.46.1	Talker Priority and Emergency Indication

This IE contains the talker priority, the status of the emergency mode and the availability of the voice group call channel for sending uplink access requests related to talker priority. If the IE is not present then the MS assumes that the emergency mode is not set and that the network does not support talker priority.

  NOTE:	The channel to be used for uplink access requests related to application-specific data is specified in the Uplink Access Indication (see sub-clause 9.1.46.4).


9.1.46.2	Token

This IE contains the 32 bit long token for the validation of the Priority Uplink Request.


9.1.46.3	Talker Identity

This IE contains the identity of the current talker.


9.1.46.4	Uplink Access Indication

This IE indicates whether a mobile sending application-specific data should perform uplink access on the group call channel or via the RACH.


9.1.47	Uplink free

This message is sent on the main DCCH, in unacknowledged mode using the RR short protocol discriminator by the network to inform the mobile station of the uplink status of the voice group call channel. See table 9.1.47.1. The message indicates the uplink as free unless it is used by the network to request the mobile station to perform an uplink reply procedure.

9.1.50	System information type 10 $(ASCI)$

The understanding of messages of this message type is only required for mobile stations supporting VGCS listening and VBS listening. A mobile station not understanding the message shall treat it as unknown message.

Messages of this message type are optionally sent by the network in unacknowledged mode on the SACCH related to the voice broadcast channel or voice group call channel. SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 10 messages contain information about neighbour cells. When sent on the SACCH of a VGCS or VBS downlink, SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 10 messages address all mobile stations receiving that downlink within the cell. There may be different SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 10 messages sent on the same SACCH.

They are not standard layer 3 messages. They shall be transferred using the short header format for SACCH messages sent in unacknowledged mode specified in 3GPP TS 24.007.

Each SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 10 message defines a list of cells and may contain further information for cells of that list, a cell being identified by the pair of ARFCN and BSIC of the BCCH. Newer information about a cell received in SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 10 messages shall replace older information.

|The first BSIC parameter received in the structure relates to the index in the BA(list) frequency referenced by the parameter BA_Index_Start_BSIC |
|(index 0 if BA_Index_Start_BSIC is missing). Then the FREQUENCY_SCROLLING bit indicates whether the next BSIC in the structure relates to the same|
|frequency in the BA(list), with '0', or if the next BSIC in the structure relates to the subsequent frequency in the BA (list), with '1'. Each    |
|next BSIC within the structure creates a subsequent GSM Cell list index.                                                                          |

Validity Information is included for each neighbour cell, in order of increasing BCCH ARFCN (i.e. in the same order as used in SI10 Rest Octets, see sub-clause 10.5.2.44). If two or more neighbour cells have the same BCCH ARFCN then the BSIC shall be included to distinguish the cells.

If the group channel (either before or after a change) in a neighbouring cell is non-hopping, then bit 1 of the Validity bitmap shall be set to 1.

SI10bis Neighbour Cell Info is included for as many cells as possible for which bit 0 of the Validity bitmap is equal to 1 and bit 2 of the Validity bitmap is equal to 0, in the order in which the corresponding cells' Validity Information was included.

If a mobile station receives a message including a Validity bitmap in which all 3 bits are set to 0, the mobile station shall diagnose an imperative message part error.


9.1.58	NOTIFY APPLICATION DATA

9.1.59.0	Request Reference

When included in the EC IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT TYPE 1 message the content of Request Reference IE reflects the TDMA frame used to send the EC PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST message on the RACH and the random bits included within the EC PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST message (see sub-clause 9.1.65).


9.1.59.1	EC Packet Channel Description Type 1

The EC Packet Channel Description Type 1 IE identifies the radio parameters applicable to an uplink EC TBF for a mobile station that has enabled EC operation and is attempting system access using the RACH (i.e. Coverage Class 1 has been selected by the mobile station for  both the uplink and the downlink).


9.1.59.2	EC Fixed Uplink Allocation

The EC Fixed Uplink Allocation IE identifies the parameters required for uplink packet data transfer when EC operation is enabled (see sub-clause 10.5.2.86).


9.1.60	EC IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT TYPE 2

This message is sent on the EC-CCCH by the network to assign uplink packet resources to a mobile station that has enabled EC operation and attempts system access using the 1TS EC-RACH Mapping method or the 2TS EC-RACH Mapping method (see sub-clause 3.5.2.1.2a). When sending this message the network assigns pre-allocated uplink resources to the mobile station (see sub-clause 3.5.2.1.3a).

This message can also be sent using the RACH (see sub-clause 3.5.2.1.2) in which the message format is as shown in Tables 9.1.65.3 and 9.1.65.4.

The uplink access burst block format is defined in 3GPP TS 44.004. The order of bit transmission is defined in 3GPP TS 44.004. The message is coded in 11-bit format.

The EC capability is implied when a MS attempts system access using the EC-RACH or by the use of TS3 when a MS attempts system access using the RACH.

10	General message format and information elements coding

The figures and text in this sub-clause describe the Information Elements contents.


10.1	Overview

Within the RR protocols defined in 3GPP TS 44.018, every message with the exception of the messages sent on the BCCH, downlink CCCH, SCH, EC-SCH, RACH and the HANDOVER ACCESS message, is a standard L3 message as defined in 3GPP TS 24.007. This means that the message consists of the following parts:

  a)	protocol discriminator;

  b)	skip indicator;

  c)	message type;

  d)	other information elements, as required.

This organization is illustrated in the example shown in figure 10.1.1.

|8                                       |7                                       |6                    |
|Message type                                                                    |octet 2              |
|Other information elements as required                                          |etc.                 |

Figure 10.1.1: General message organization example

Messages sent on the EC-AGCH are formatted as described in sub-clause 9.1.30c. Messages sent on the EC-BCCH and EC-CCCH use a short message type as described in sub-clause 10.4. All messages sent on the EC-CCCH consist of the following fields in the order listed:

  -	Message Type field (4 bits)

  -	Used DL Coverage Class (2 bits)

  -	EC Page Extension (5 bits, except for the EC Dummy message in which case this field is excluded)

Additional fields (message specific)A mobile station that has enabled EC operation and receives an RR message on downlink EC-CCCH with a message type it does not understand shall still read the Used DL Coverage Class and EC Page Extension fields while ignoring the remaining part of the message.

Unless specified otherwise in the message descriptions of sub-clause 9, a particular information element shall not be present more than once in a given message.

The term "default" implies that the value defined shall be used in the absence of any assignment, or that this value allows negotiation of alternative values in between the two peer entities.

When a field extends over more than one octet, the order of bit values progressively decreases as the octet number increases. The least significant bit of the field is represented by the lowest numbered bit of the highest numbered octet of the field.

When a message is coded using CSN.1 notation, the definition of the CSN.1 syntax in CSN.1 Specification, Version 2.0, shall be used.


10.2	Protocol Discriminator

The Protocol Discriminator (PD) and its use are defined in 3GPP TS 24.007.


10.3	Skip indicator


10.3.1	Skip indicator

Bits 5 to 8 of the first octet of every Radio Resource management message and GPRS Transparent Transport protocol message contain the skip indicator.

When network sharing is in use in a cell, and in the case of the PAGING RESPONSE message, a mobile station supporting network sharing shall encode the skip indicator as described within 3GPP TS 24.008. A supporting network receiving a PAGING RESPONSE message with a skip indicator different from ‘0000’ shall consider the mobile station as supporting network sharing.

When network sharing is in use in a cell, and in the case of the GPRS Transparent Transport protocol message, a mobile station supporting network sharing may encode the skip indicator different from ‘0000’ (see sub-clause 3.4.26) coded as described within 3GPP TS 24.008.

For all other cases, a message received with skip indicator different from ‘0000’ shall be ignored. A message received with skip indicator encoded as ‘0000’ shall not be ignored (unless it is ignored for other reasons). A protocol entity sending a Radio Resource management message or GPRS Transparent Transport protocol message shall encode the skip indicator as ‘0000’.


10.4	Message Type

The message type IE and its use are defined in 3GPP TS 24.007. Tables 10.4.1 and 10.4.2 define the value part of the message type IE used in the Radio Resource management protocol. Table 10.4.3 defines the value part of the message type IE used in the GPRS Transparent Transport protocol. Table 10.4.4 defines the value part of the message type IE used in the Radio Resource management protocol for messages sent on the EC-BCCH and EC-CCCH.

10.5	Other information elements

The different formats (V, LV, T, TV, TLV) and the four categories of information elements (type 1, 2, 3, and 4) are defined in 3GPP TS 24.007.

The first octet of an information element in the non-imperative part contains the IEI of the information element. If this octet does not correspond to an IEI known in the message, the receiver shall determine whether this IE is of type 1 or 2 (i.e. it is an information element of one octet length) or an IE of type 4 (i.e. that the next octet is the length indicator indicating the length of the remaining of the information element) (see 3GPP TS 24.007).

This allows the receiver to jump over unknown information elements and to analyse any following information elements.

The information elements which are common for at least two of the three protocols Radio Resources management, Mobility Management and Call Control, are listed in 3GPP TS 24.008.

The information elements for the protocols Radio Resources management are listed in sub-clause 10.5.2. Default information element identifiers are listed in annex K.

  NOTE:	Different information elements may have the same default information element identifier if they belong to different protocols.

The descriptions of the information element types in sub-clause 10.5.2 are organized in alphabetical order of the IE types. Each IE type is described in one sub-clause.

The sub-clause may have an introduction:

  -	possibly explaining the purpose of the IE;

  -	possibly describing whether the IE belongs to type 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5;

  -	possibly indicating the length that the information element has if it is either type 5 or if it is used in format TV (type 1 and 3) or TLV (type 4).

A figure of the sub-clause defines the structure of the IE indicating:

  -	possibly the position and length of the IEI. (However it depends on the message in which the IE occurs whether the IE contains an IEI.);

  -	the fields the IE value part is composed of;

  -	possibly the position and length of the length indicator. (However it depends on the IE type whether the IE contains a length indicator or not.);

  -	possibly octet numbers of the octets that compose the IE (see sub-clause a) below).

Finally, the sub-clause contains tables defining the structure and value range of the fields that compose the IE value part. The order of appearance for information elements in a message is defined in clause 9.

The order of the information elements within the imperative part of messages has been chosen so that information elements with 1/2 octet of content (type 1) go together in succession. The first type 1 information element occupies bits 1 to 4 of octet N, the second bits 5 to 8 of octet N, the third bits 1 to 4 of octet N + 1 etc. If the number of type 1 information elements is odd then bits 5 to 8 of the last octet occupied by these information elements contains a spare half octet IE in format V.

Where the description of information elements in this Technical Specification contains bits defined to be "spare bits", these bits shall set to the indicated value (0 or 1) by the sending side, and their value shall be ignored by the receiving side. With few exceptions, spare bits are indicated as being set to "0" in 3GPP TS 44.018.

The following rules apply for the coding of type 4 information elements:

  a)	The octet number of an octet (which is defined in the figure of a sub-clause) consists of a positive integer, possibly of an additional letter, and possibly of an additional asterisk, see sub-clause f). The positive integer identifies one octet or a group of octets.

  b)	Each octet group is a self contained entity. The internal structure of an octet group may be defined in alternative ways.

  c)	An octet group is formed by using some extension mechanism. The preferred extension mechanism is to extend an octet (N) through the next octet(s) (Na, Nb, etc.) by using bit 8 in each octet as an extension bit.

    	The bit value "0" indicates that the octet group continues through to the next octet. The bit value "1" indicates that this octet is the last octet of the group. If one octet (Nb) is present, the preceding octets (N and Na) shall also be present.

    	In the format descriptions appearing in sub-clause 10.5.1 to 10.5.4, bit 8 is marked "0/1 ext" if another octet follows. Bit 8 is marked "1 ext" if this is the last octet in the extension domain.

    	Additional octets may be defined in later versions of the protocols ("1 ext" changed to "0/1 ext") and equipments shall be prepared to receive such additional octets; the contents of these octets shall be ignored. However the length indicated in clauses 9 and 10 only takes into account this version of the protocols.

  d)	In addition to the extension mechanism defined above, an octet (N) may be extended through the next octet(s) (N+1, N+2 etc.) by indications in bits 7-1 (of octet N).

  e)	The mechanisms in c) and d) may be combined.

  f)	Optional octets are marked with asterisks (*).

10.5.2.1a	BA Range

The purpose of the BA Range information element is to provide the mobile station with ARFCN range information which can be used in the cell selection procedure.

The BA Range information element is coded as shown in figure 10.5.21a.1 and table 10.5.2.1a.1.

The BA Range is a type 4 information element with a minimum length of 6 octets. No upper length limit is specified except for that given by the maximum number of octets in a L3 message (see 3GPP TS 44.006).

10.5.2.1b	Cell Channel Description

The purpose of the Cell Channel Description information element is to provide the reference frequency list to be used to decode the mobile allocation information element.

The Cell Channel Description is a type 3 information element with 17 octets length.

There are several formats for the Cell Channel Description information element, distinguished by the "format indicator" subfield. Some formats are frequency bit maps, the others use a special encoding scheme.

  NOTE:	No more than 64 RF channels should be encoded in the Cell Allocation since this is the maximum number of RF channels which can be referenced in the Mobile Allocation IE.

The RANGE LOWER is coded as the binary representation of the ARFCN used as the lower limit of a range of frequencies to be used by the mobile station in cell selection and reselection (see 3GPP TS 45.008 and 3GPP TS 23.022).

The RANGE HIGHER is coded as the binary representation of the ARFCN used as the higher limit of a range of frequencies to be used by the mobile station in cell selection and reselection (see 3GPP TS 45.008 and 3GPP TS 23.022).

BA FREQ is coded as the binary representation of the ARFCN indicating a single frequency to be used by the mobile station in cell selection and reselection (see 3GPP TS 45.008 and 3GPP TS 23.022).


10.5.2.1d	UTRAN Freq List

The  UTRAN Freq List information element provides the mobile station with a list of UTRAN frequencies used by the network. These frequencies may be used in the cell selection procedure, see 3GPP TS 25.304.

FDD_ARFCN and TDD_ARFCN are defined as the UARFCN in 3GPP TS 25.101 and 3GPP TS 25.102. If both an UTRAN Freq List information element and an UTRAN Frequency List Description struct (3GPP TS 44.060) are received, the mobile station shall use the one most recently received.

The UTRAN Freq List is a type 4 information element with a minimum length of 3 octets. No upper length limit is specified except for that given by the maximum number of octets in a L3 message (see 3GPP TS 44.006).

|The value 0 indicates that the increment value is 15 but the concerned channel is not used and the|
|next field, i.e. Increment skip ARFCN n+1 (if present) must be added to the increment to determine|
|the next absolute RF channel number in the sequence of channels used in the frequency hopping.    |



10.5.2.13	Frequency List

The purpose of the Frequency List information element is to provide the list of the absolute radio frequency channel numbers used in a frequency hopping sequence.

The Frequency List information element is a type 4 information element.

There are several formats for the Frequency List information element, distinguished by the "format indicator" subfield. Some formats are frequency bit maps, the others use a special encoding scheme.

10.5.2.19	L2 Pseudo Length

The L2 Pseudo Length information element indicates the number of octets following it in the message which are to be interpreted in the scope of the phase 1 protocol, i.e. the total number of octets (excluding the Rest Octets when present) for which T, V, TV, LV, or TLV formatting is used (reference table 11.1/3GPP TS 24.007).

The L2 Pseudo Length information element is the first part of e.g. SYSTEM INFORMATION messages which are mentioned as exceptions in sub-clause 10.1. It occupies the first octet of such messages.

For any of the SYSTEM INFORMATION messages sent on the BCCH, a mobile station should ignore the contents of the L2 Pseudo Length value contained in the L2 Pseudo Length information element. For some specific messages, further requirements are specified in clause 9.

The L2 Pseudo Length Information element is an element with 2 octets length:

|The coding of the L2 pseudo length value field is the binary representation of the L2 pseudo      |
|length of the message in which the L2 pseudo length information element occurs.                   |


  NOTE:	Bits 1 and 2 are not spare.


10.5.2.20	Measurement Results

The purpose of the Measurement Results information element is to provide the results of the measurements made by the mobile station on the serving cell and the neighbour cells.

The Measurement Results information element is coded as shown in figure 10.5.2.20.1 and tables 10.5.2.20.0 and 10.5.2.20.1. The field mapping convention defined for RLC/MAC control blocks shall be used (see 3GPP TS 44.060).

The Measurement Results is a type 3 information element with 17 octets length.

|Report on GSM cells:                                                                                                                |
|BCCH-FREQ-NCELL i, BCCH carrier of the i'th neighbour cell.                                                                         |
|The BCCH-FREQ-NCELL i field is coded as the binary representation of the position, starting with 0, of the i'th neighbour cells BCCH|
|carrier in the BCCH channel list. The BCCH channel list is composed of one or two BCCH channel sub lists, each sub list is derived  |
|from the set of frequencies defined by reference neighbour cell description information element or elements. In the latter case the |
|set is the union of the two sets defined by the two neighbour cell description information elements.                                |
|In each BCCH channel sub list the absolute RF channel numbers are placed in increasing order of ARFCN, except that ARFCN 0, if      |
|included in the set, is put in the last position in the sub list. The BCCH channel list consists either of only the sub list derived|
|from the neighbour cell description information element(s) in System Information 2/5 (and possible 2bis/5bis) or of that sub list   |
|immediately followed by the sub list derived from the neighbour cell description information element in System Information 2ter/5ter|
|for the case System Information 2ter/5ter is also received. If the set of ARFCNs defined by the reference neighbour cell description|
|information element or elements includes frequencies that the mobile station does not support then these ARFCNs shall be included in|
|the list.                                                                                                                           |
|The notation 2/5 etc. means that the rules above apply to the neighbour cell description information elements received in System    |
|Information 2, 2bis and 2ter and to those received in System Information 5, 5bis and 5ter separately.                               |
|Range: 0 to 31/30.                                                                                                                  |

|If no more than 31 (GSM) ARFCN frequencies are included in the BA (list), the index BCCH-FREQ-NCELL 31 indicates report(s) on       |

|In this case, the corresponding 'BSIC-NCELL' field in figure 10.5.2.20.1 carries the index of the i'th 3G neighbour cell in the     |

|(31 - NUM_E-UTRAN_FREQUENCIES) to 30 (inclusive) indicate report(s) on E-UTRAN cells. The index BCCH-FREQ-NCELL 30 indicates a      |
|report of an E-UTRAN neighbour cell on the first frequency defined in the E-UTRAN Neighbour Cell list, the value 29 indicates a     |
|report of an E-UTRAN neighbour cell on the second frequency in the E-UTRAN Neighbour Cell list and so on.                           |
|NUM_E-UTRAN_FREQUENCIES is defined as the number of separate E-UTRAN frequencies in the E-UTRAN Neighbour Cell list.                |
|If the BCCH-FREQ-NCELL index indicates an E-UTRAN frequency, the corresponding 'BSIC-NCELL' field in figure 10.5.2.20.1 contains the|

10.5.2.25	P3 Rest Octets

The P3 Rest Octets information element contains information on the channel needed by the network and information about the status of information on an existing NCH, priority levels applied for mobile station identities and spare bits. The purpose of the spare bits is to allow the upward compatible introduction of new information on the PCH in later phases.

The P3 Rest Octets information element is a type 5 information element with 3 octets length.

10.5.2.25b	Dedicated mode or TBF

The Dedicated mode or TBF information element is used by the network to indicate to the mobile station whether the rest of the message shall be decoded as an IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT message allocating a channel in dedicated mode or whether the rest of the message shall be decoded as the allocation of a Temporary Block Flow or to indicate that no Temporary Block Flow is allocated for the case where an IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT message is sent in response to an EGPRS MULTILATERATION REQUEST message indicating ‘Access Burst method’ or ‘Extended Access Burst method’  (see sub-clause 3.5.2.1.2 and sub-clause 3.11).

This information element also indicates:

  -	whether the IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT message identifies a mobile station in the IA Rest Octets information elements for the assignment of a downlink TBF; and

  -	whether the IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT message is the first message of two IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT messages in a two-message assignment of an uplink or downlink TBF.

The Dedicated mode or TBF information element is coded as shown in figure 10.5.2.25b.1, table 10.5.2.25b.1 and Table 10.5.2.25b.2.

The Dedicated mode or TBF is a type 1 information element.

|This field contains the timeslot number of the timeslot where the uplink PACCH for the MS is located. It is encoded as the binary representation  |
|of the timeslot number as defined in 3GPP TS 45.002. The mobile station shall send all uplink control messages on the PACCH/U on the uplink       |
|control timeslot. If the uplink control message relates to a TBF which does not have a valid TFI on the downlink timeslot corresponding to the    |
|uplink control timeslot, it shall indicate (one of) the downlink timeslot(s) associated with that downlink TBF in the TIMESLOT_NUMBER field. The  |

|This field contains the PFI parameter identifying a Packet Flow Context. The PFI parameter is encoded as the contents of the PFI information      |
|element as defined in 3GPP TS 24.008. If EMST is used (see 3GPP TS 44.060), this field contains the PFI parameter identifying the Packet Flow     |

|This is an unformatted 8 bit field. Typically the contents of this field are coded the same as the|
|CHANNEL REQUEST message shown in Figure 9.1.8.1 and Table 9.1.8.1, sub-clause 9.1.8. When included|
|in an EC IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT TYPE 1 message (see sub-claue 9.1.59) this field is coded as the 8  |
|least significant bits of the corresponding EC PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST message sent on the RACH    |
|(see sub-claue 9.1.65) and is never used to indicate the presence of Extended RA information. The |
|8 least significant bits of an EC PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST message are identified using the same    |
|method for identifying the 5 least significant of an EGPRS PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST message         |
|described in sub-clause 10.5.2.16 for the case where the Extended RA field is included in the IA  |
|Rest Octets information element (i.e. when the Request Reference IE is included in the EC         |
|IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT TYPE 1 message the RA field shall include all fields of the EC PACKET CHANNEL|
|REQUEST message except for the ‘EC-NumberOfBlocks’ field).                                        |

|sub-clause 3.5.2.1.2, sub-clause 3.11 and 3GPP TS 44.060 [76]) this field includes the 8 least    |
|significant bits of the corresponding EGPRS MULTILATERATION REQUEST message sent on the RACH (see |
|3GPP TS 44.060). In this case the Dedicated mode or TBF IE indicates that a Temporary Block Flow  |
|(TBF) is assigned by the IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT message (see sub-clause 10.5.2.25b).                |
|When included in an IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT message sent in response to an EGPRS MULTILATERATION     |
|REQUEST message indicating the ‘Access Burst’ method or ‘Extended Access Burst’ method this field |
|is ignored. In this case the Dedicated mode or TBF IE indicates that no TBF or dedicated mode     |

10.5.2.30a	Random Reference/ Establishment Cause

The purpose of the Random Reference/ Establishment Cause information element within Priority Uplink Request is to provide the reason for the request and a random reference to correlate a VGCS UPLINK GRANT with the PRIORITY UPLINK REQUEST message sent by a mobile station. It is based on the UPLINK ACCESS message (subclause 9.1.45).

The Random Reference/ Establishment Cause is coded as shown in figure 10.5.2.30a.1 and table 10.5.2.30a.1

The Random Reference/Establishment Cause is a type 3 information element with 1 octet length.

Establishment Cause (octet 1)
This information field indicates the reason for requesting the uplink. This field has a variable length (from 3 bits to 8 bits)

Randon Reference (octet 1)
This is an unformatted field with variable length (from 5 down to 0 bits) indicated bv ‘xxxxx’ in the table below.

10.5.2.33b	SI 2quater Rest Octets

The SI 2quater Rest Octets information element contains neighbour cell lists for UTRAN and/or E-UTRAN cells and/or CSG cells. For cell reselection to UTRAN, it is used with the SI 2ter Rest Octets information to build the 3G Cell Reselection list, see sub-clause 3.4.1.2.1.7. For cell reselection to E-UTRAN, it is used directly to build the E-UTRAN Neighbour Cell list.

The SI 2quater Rest Octets information element is a type 5 information element with 20 octet length.

10.5.2.35	SI 4 Rest Octets

The SI 4 Rest Octets information element includes parameters which are used by the mobile station for cell selection and reselection purposes. It may also include the POWER OFFSET parameter used by DCS 1800 Class 3 MS.

Its content is described in table 10.5.2.35.1.

  NOTE:	In the future evolution of this standard the values 64h and 72h shall not be used as values of the first octet when this information element is used in the SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 4 message. This will prevent mobile stations misinterpreting this information as the CBCH IEIs .

|CELL_RESELECT_OFFSET is coded as the binary representation of the "CELL_RESELECT_OFFSET" in 3GPP TS 45.008. It is a value used by the mobile      |
|station to apply a positive or negative offset to the value of C2 as defined in 3GPP TS 23.022 and 3GPP TS 45.008.                                |

|The PENALTY_TIME is coded as the binary representation of the "PENALTY_TIME" in 3GPP TS 45.008. It defines the length of time for which           |
|TEMPORARY_OFFSET is active. The usage of PENALTY_TIME is described in 3GPP TS 23.022 and 3GPP TS 45.008.                                          |

The starting time and the times mentioned above are with reference to the frame numbering in the concerned cell. They are given in units of frames (around 4.615 ms).

The Starting Time IE can encode only an interval of time of 42 432 frames, that is to say around 195.8 seconds. To remove any ambiguity, the specification for a reception at time T is that the encoded interval is (T-10808, T+31623). In rigorous terms, if we note ST the starting time:

	if 0 <= (ST-T) mod 42432 <= 31623, the indicated time is the next time when FN mod 42432 is equal to ST;

	if 32024 <= (ST-T) mod 42432 <= 42431, the indicated time has already elapsed.

The reception time T is not specified here precisely. To allow room for various MS implementations, the limit between the two behaviours above may be anywhere within the interval defined by:

	31624 <= (ST-T) mod 42432 <= 32023.


10.5.2.39	Synchronization Indication

Static and dynamic conditions:

  1)	Information from the last received neighbour cell description in SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 5/5bis/5ter is necessary for the mobile station to interpret <neighbour information>. If <BA ind> is different from the last received BA IND value indicated in SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 5/5bis/5ter, <neighbour information> cannot be interpreted by the mobile station.

  2)	If the correspondence between neighbour cell frequencies and sets of pairs (BSIC, cell information) cannot be established following the rules below, or if more than one set of such pairs corresponds to one neighbour cell frequency, the mobile station shall diagnose an imperative message part error.

Attributes, field contents:

  1)	<cell info> defines a BSIC given by <bsic : bit(6)>. It also defines cell information. If <cell parameters> is contained in <cell info>, this cell information is the cell information given by <cell parameters>; if <cell parameters> is not contained in <cell info>, this cell information is empty.

  2)	<differential cell info> defines a BSIC given by <bsic : bit(6)> or by <BCC : bit(3)>, see below. It also defines cell information. If <diff cell pars> is contained in <differential cell info>, this cell information is the cell information given by <diff cell pars>; if <diff cell pars> is not contained in <differential cell info>, this cell information is empty.

  3)	<cell parameters> either indicates a barred cell (by presence of <cell barred>)or specifies cell information given by <further cell info>.

  4)	Each occurrence of <diff cell pars> either indicates a barred cell (by presence of <cell barred>)or specifies cell information given by <further diff cell info>.

  5)	<further cell info> specifies cell information given by its components:

    -	<la different>;

    -	<ms txpwr max cch : bit(5)>;

    -	<rxlev access min : bit(6)>;

    -	<cell reselect offset : bit(6)>;

    -	<temporary offset : bit(3)>;

    -	<penalty time : bit(5)>;

    as defined below.

  6)	For each occurrence of <further diff cell info>, a cell information is defined. This information is given by <la different> and remaining cell information established as follows:

    	The remaining cell information defined for the first occurrence of <further diff cell info> consists of the cell information given by its actual components plus the cell information specified by <further cell info> corresponding to its missing components.

    	The remaining cell information defined for a later occurrence of <further diff cell info> consists of the cell information given by its actual components plus the remaining cell information corresponding to its missing components which is defined for the previous occurrence of <further diff cell info>.

    	Here, the

    "actual components" of an occurrence of <further diff cell info> denotes those parameters among:

    -	<ms txpwr max cch : bit(5)>;

    -	<rxlev access min : bit(6)>;

    -	<cell reselect offset : bit(6)>;

    -	<temporary offset : bit(3)>;

    -	<penalty time : bit(5)>;

    which are present in that occurrence.

    "missing components" of an occurrence of <differential cell info> denote those parameters among:

    -	<ms txpwr max cch : bit(5)>;

    -	<rxlev access min : bit(6)>;

    -	<cell reselect offset : bit(6)>;

    -	<temporary offset : bit(3)>;

    -	<penalty time : bit(5)>;

    which are not present in that occurrence.

  7)	Each occurrence of <bsic : bit(6)> specifies a BSIC by encoding its binary representation. <BCC : bit(3)> specifies a BCC by encoding its binary representation; it specifies the BSIC given by that BCC and the NCC of the BSIC specified by the previous occurrence of <BCC : bit(3)> or <bsic : bit(6)>. All occurrences of <bsic: bit(6)> and <BCC : bit(3)> establish a list of BSIC.

  8)	<first frequency : bit(5)> is the 5 bit binary coding of an integer n with 0 <= n <= 31. It specifies a first frequency number n+1.

  9)	<SI10 rest octets> defines a correspondence between neighbour cell frequencies and sets of pairs (BSIC, cell information) defining the parameters for cell re-selection of any corresponding neighbour cell with BCCH on that frequency and having that BSIC:

    -	Let a(1),..., a(n) be the list of neighbour cell frequencies, in the order determined by the mobile station. Let i be the first frequency number specified by <first frequency : bit(5)> (see above).

    -	The first BSIC and the cell information specified by <cell info> build a pair belonging to the set corresponding to a(i).

    -	If an m-th occurrence of <info field> is present (where m >=2), having established the correspondence of the (m-1)-th BSIC to a neighbour frequency a(k), the m-th BSIC and following <differential cell info>:

       -	belong to a(k), if <next frequency> is not present in the m-th occurrence of <info field>;

       -	belong to a((smod(k+t)), if <next frequency> is present exactly t times in the m-th occurrence of <info field>.

    -	Here, for an integer j, smod(j) := ((j-1) mod n) + 1.

  10)	If <la different> contains a <cell reselect hysteresis: bit(3)>, this means that the cell is to be considered by the mobile station to belong to a different location area and that for the cell, the cell reselect hysteresis specified in <cell reselect hysteresis : bit(3)> applies.

  11)	If <la different> doesn't contain a <cell reselect hysteresis: bit(3)>, this means that the cell is to be considered by the mobile station to belong to the same location area.

  12)	For <cell reselect hysteresis : bit(3)>: see sub-clause 10.5.2.4.

  13)	For <ms txpwr max cch : bit(5)>: see sub-clause 10.5.2.4.

  14)	For <rxlev access min : bit(6)> see sub-clause 10.5.2.4.

  15)	For <cell reselect offset : bit(6)>: see sub-clause 10.5.2.35.

  16)	For <temporary offset : bit(3)>: see sub-clause 10.5.2.35.

  17)	For <penalty time : bit(5)>: see sub-clause 10.5.2.35.

10.5.2.73	Data Identity

The Data Identity Element contains Application Indicator, Data Identifier and Distribution Parameter. The Application Indicator is used to identify whether the Application data IE, which is sent together with the Data Identity IE, is an application-specific data or is a confirmation. The Data Identifier is to provide a sequence number of the sending of Application Data. The value of the Data identifier is dependent on the value of the Application Indicator:

  -	If the Application Indicator indicates sending application data to the network, the data identifier contains a number from the range between 0 and 15 which is generated by the mobile station.

  -	If the Application Indicator indicates sending confirmation of the reception of the application data, the Data Identifier shall contain the data identifier which was received in the Data Identity IE sent by the previous sender.

10.5.8.1	LLC PDU Container

The purpose of the LLC PDU Container information element is to carry an LLC PDU with upper layer information between the network and the mobile station. Within the scope of 3GPP TS 44.018 the content of the LLC PDU field is an array of octets. The usage of the contents of this transportation mechanism is defined in 3GPP TS 44.064.

The LLC PDU Container information element is coded as shown in figure 10.5.8.1.1.

The LLC PDU Container is a type 4 information element with a minimum length of 3 octets. No upper length limit is specified except for that given by the maximum number of octets in a L3 message (see 3GPP TS 44.006).

11	List of system parameters

The description of timers in the following table should be considered a brief summary. The precise details are found in clauses 3 to 6, which should be considered the definitive descriptions.


11.1	Timers and counters for radio resource management


11.1.1	Timers on the mobile station side

  T3110:	This timer is used to delay the channel deactivation after the receipt of a (full) CHANNEL RELEASE. Its purpose is to let some time for disconnection of the main signalling link.

             	Its value is set to such that the DISC frame is sent twice in case of no answer from the network. (It should be chosen to obtain a good probability of normal termination (i.e. no time out of T3109) of the channel release procedure.)

  T3112	The timer is used by a VGCS mobile when receiving segmented RP-Data message on the SACCH. The timer is started when receiving the first segment of a segmented RP-Data message for a group call that the MS is a member of, for which no previous segment has been received.

             	It is stopped in the following situations:

             -	The MS receives the complete RP-Data message

             -	The MS discards the message as a result of timer T3114 expiring for some other message

             -	The MS deletes the segment(s) (with SMS reference number n) because it has received a segment with a SMS reference number which is more than 4 higher (modulo 16) than that of the message corresponding to this timer

             -	The MS changes its channel

             -	The voice group call is cleared

             	The value of the timer is 20 seconds.

At expiry of timer T3146, if the radio access part of the MTA procedure is ongoing then it is terminated for the current cell and the mobile station MS tunes to the next cell in the list of applicable cells and continues the radio access part of the MTA procedure therein.

             	For the case where a CHANNEL REQUEST or EGPRS PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST has been sent the minimum value of this timer is equal to the time taken by T+2S slots of the mobile station's RACH. S and T are defined in sub-clause 3.3.1.2. The maximum value of this timer is 5 seconds. For the case where an EC PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST message has been sent the value of this timer is equal to the total number of downlink 51-multiframes it reads in an attempt to find a matching response (see sub-clause 3.5.2.1.2a).

             	-	Notifications for another group call are received on the PCH

             The value of the timer is 5 seconds.

  T3220	The timer is used by an MBMS capable mobile station when receiving pre-notification of an MBMS session. The timer is started when receiving a PAGING REQUEST message containing an MBMS pre-notification that the mobile station shall receive.

             	It is stopped at the receipt of a PAGING REQUEST message containing a notification of the same session as when starting this timer, or if any other RR procedure on CCCH not related to MBMS is triggered or a notification is received for a higher priority session while the timer is running.

             At expiry, the mobile station returns to DRX mode unless it is engaged in any other MBMS session and then stays in broadcast/multicast receive mode.

             	The value of the timer is 46 s.

  T3222:	An instance of the timer may be used by an MBMS capable mobile station in dedicated mode during the notification of MBMS. An instance of this timer may be started at the receipt of an MBMS ANNOUNCEMENT message when in dedicated mode.

             	The instance of this timer is stopped when the mobile enters packet idle mode.

             	At expiry of an instance of this timer, the mobile station discards the MBMS related information stored upon receipt of the corresponding MBMS ANNOUNCEMENT message.

             	The value of the timer is defined in sub-clause 3.4.27.2.3.

  T3224:	The timer start at on receipt of a VGCS_UPLINK_GRANT message aimed to another mobile station.

             It is stopped when the mobile station received an UPLINK BUSY message.

             The value of the timer is 1 s.

  T3230:	The timer is used to control the validity period of individual priorities. It is started on receipt of the individual priorities for cell reselection via dedicated signalling or on inter-RAT reselection to GERAN if the corresponding timer in the source RAT (i.e., T320 in E-UTRA, and T322 in UTRA) was running when reselection occurred.

             	When one of the conditions specified in subclause 3.2.3.3 is met, the MS shall stop T3230 and delete the corresponding individual priorities.

             At expiry the mobile station shall delete the corresponding individual priorities.

  T3232:	The timer is used to control the length of the non-DRX mode period in which the mobile station is acquiring an ETWS Primary Notification message. It is started on receipt of a first PAGING REQUEST TYPE 1 message containing a valid segment of an ETWS Primary Notification message.

             It is stopped in the following situations:

                	The mobile station receives the complete ETWS Primary Notification message

                	Upon initiating cell reselection or connection establishment procedures

  T3234:	The timer is used to prevent a mobile station accessing the network when the low priority indicator is set to "MS is configured to NAS signalling low priority" (see 3GPP TS 24.008) from requesting CS resources (see sub-clause 3.3.1.1.3.2a). When a mobile station starts an implicit reject timer it selects a value randomly drawn from a uniform probability distribution within the set {10.0, 10.1, 10.2, …200.0} seconds (inclusive).

             It is started when the Implicit Reject procedure is initiated following mobile station reception of an implicit reject indication for the CS domain prior to sending any CHANNEL REQUEST messages on the RACH or when T3126 expires (see sub-clause 3.3.1.1.3.2a).

             It is stopped in the following cases:

             -	The mobile station responds to a PAGING REQUEST message

             -	The mobile station performs cell re-selection.

             At expiry, the mobile station may once again access the network when the low priority indicator is set to "MS is configured to NAS signalling low priority" and request CS resources.

  T3236:	The timer is used to prevent a mobile station accessing the network when the low priority indicator is set to "MS is configured to NAS signalling low priority" (see 3GPP TS 24.008) from requesting PS resources (see sub-clause 3.3.1.1.3.2a and sub-clause 3.5.2a.2). When a mobile station starts an implicit reject timer it selects a value randomly drawn from a uniform probability distribution within the set {10.0, 10.1, 10.2, …200.0} seconds (inclusive).

             It is started when T3146 expires (see sub-clause 3.3.1.1.3.2a or 3.5.2a.2).

             It is stopped in the following cases:

             -	The mobile station responds to a PAGING REQUEST or an EC PAGING REQUEST message

             -	The mobile station performs cell re-selection.

             At expiry, the mobile station may once again access the network when the low priority indicator is set to "MS is configured to NAS signalling low priority" and request PS resources.


11.1.2	Timers on the network side

  T3101:	This timer is started when a channel is allocated with an IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT message. It is stopped when the MS has correctly seized the channels.

             	Its value is network dependent.

  NOTE 1:	It could be higher than the maximum time for a L2 establishment attempt.

  T3103:	This timer is started by the sending of a HANDOVER message and is normally stopped when the MS has correctly seized the new channel. Its purpose is to keep the old channels sufficiently long for the MS to be able to return to the old channels, and to release the channels if the MS is lost.

             	Its value is network dependent.

  NOTE 2:	It could be higher than the maximum transmission time of the HANDOVER COMMAND, plus the value of T3124, plus the maximum duration of an attempt to establish a data link in multiframe mode.)

  T3105:	This timer is used for the repetition of the PHYSICAL INFORMATION message during the hand-over procedure.

             	Its value is network dependent.

  NOTE 3:	This timer may be set to such a low value that the message is in fact continuously transmitted.

  T3107:	This timer is started by the sending of an ASSIGNMENT COMMAND or a DTM ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message and is normally stopped when the MS has correctly seized the new RR channels.

             	Its purpose is to release the new channels (and, in the case of Enhanced DTM CS establishment, the old PS resources) if the MS is lost and, except when used for Enhanced DTM CS Establishment, to keep the old channel sufficiently long for the MS to be able to return to the old channels.

             	Its value is network dependent.

  NOTE 4:	It could be higher than the maximum transmission time of the ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message plus twice the maximum duration of an attempt to establish a data link multiframe mode.

  T3109:	This timer is started when a lower layer failure is detected by the network, when it is not engaged in a RF procedure. It is also used in the channel release procedure.

             	Its purpose is to release the channels in case of loss of communication.

             	Its value is network dependent.

  NOTE 5:	Its value should be large enough to ensure that the MS detects a radio link failure.

  T3111:	This timer is used to delay the channel deactivation after disconnection of the main signalling link. Its purpose is to let some time for possible repetition of the disconnection.

             	Its value is equal to the value of T3110.

  T3113:	This timer is started when the network has sent a PAGING REQUEST message and is stopped when the network has received the PAGING RESPONSE message.

             	Its value is network dependent.

  NOTE 6:	The value could allow for repetitions of the Channel Request message and the requirements associated with T3101.

  T3115:	This timer is used for the repetition of the VGCS UPLINK GRANT message during the uplink access procedure or priority uplink request procedure.

             	Its value is network dependent.

  NOTE 7:	This timer may be set to such a low value that the message is in fact continuously transmitted.

  T3121:	This timer is started by the sending of an INTER SYSTEM TO UTRAN HANDOVER COMMAND message or of an INTER SYSTEM TO E-UTRAN HANDOVER COMMAND and is normally stopped when the MS has correctly seized the UTRAN channel(s) or E-UTRAN channel(s). Its purpose is to keep the old channels sufficiently long for the MS to be able to return to the old channels, and to release the channels if the MS is lost.

             	Its value is network dependent.

  T3123:	This timer is started by the sending of an INTER SYSTEM TO CDMA2000 HANDOVER COMMAND message and is normally stopped when the MS has correctly seized the CDMA2000 channel(s). Its purpose is to keep the old channels sufficiently long for the MS to be able to return to the old channels, and to release the channels if the MS is lost.

             	Its value is network dependent.

  T3141:	This timer is started when a temporary block flow is allocated with an IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT or an IMMEDIATE PACKET ASSIGNMENT or an EC IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT TYPE 1 message during a packet access procedure. It is stopped when the mobile station has correctly seized the temporary block flow.

             	Its value is network dependent.

  T3151:	This timer is used by the network to supervise the periodic transmission of the UPLINK BUSY message on the FACCH of the voice group call channel (see sub-clause 3.3.1.2.2a.2.2).

             	Its value is network dependent.

  T3153:	This timer is used by the network to supervise the periodic transmission of the VGCS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION message on the SACCH of the voice group call channel (see subclause 3.4.15.3a).

             	Its value is network dependent.

  T3155:	In a network supporting validation of Priority Uplink Requests, the timer T3155 supervises the broadcast of a new token after a valid Priority Uplink Request has been received.

             If a Priority Uplink Request is received, and the token matches the token in the BSS then the request is accepted, the token is invalidated and T3155 is started. On T3155 expiry a new token, and the priority of the accepted request, shall be sent in the UPLINK BUSY message on the FACCH of the voice group call channels. The T3155 timer should be set to a value that allows other service subscribers who sent a Priority Uplink Request at the same time as the one accepted by the network, to be back on the voice group call channel, in order to receive the new token.

             	The default value for T3155 is 500ms.

  T3157:	In a network supporting validation of Priority Uplink Requests, the timer T3157 supervises an additional validity period for an unused (old) token. When T3151 (supervising the periodic UPLINK BUSY) expires a new token is sent in the UPLINK BUSY message on the FACCH of the voice group call channels and timer T3157 is started. If a Priority Uplink Request is received before T3157 expires and the token matches either token in the BSS (old or new), the request is considered to be valid, both tokens in the BSS are invalidated and T3157 is stopped. If T3157 expires (i.e. no valid Priority Uplink Request has been received within T3157 seconds) the old token is invalidated.

             The value of timer T3157 is operator specific. The value chosen should allow for the reception of requests from service subscribers, who have left the group call channel before receipt of the UPLINK BUSY message with the new token.

             Its default value is 1s.


11.1.3	Other parameters

  Ny1:	The maximum number of repetitions for the PHYSICAL INFORMATION message during a handover (see sub-clause 3.4.4.2.2). The value is network dependent.

  Ny2:	The maximum number of repetitions for the VGCS UPLINK GRANT message during an uplink access procedure or priority uplink request procedure (see sub-clause 3.3.1.2.2). The value is network dependent.

             	indicates that the channel is released because of a normal event or that an assignment or handover is successfully, and normally, completed.

  Cause value = 1	Abnormal release, unspecified;

             	indicates that the channel is released because of an abnormal event without specifying further reasons.

  Cause value = 2	Abnormal release, channel unacceptable;

             	indicates that the channel type or channel characteristics are not acceptable.

  Cause value = 3	Abnormal release, timer expired;

             	indicates that the release is caused by a timer expiry.

Algorithm to encode frequency list information elements

This annex is informative.


J.1	Introduction

Some information elements encode frequency lists with a special method. The main specification specifies the meaning of the fields and hence the way to decode them, but the corresponding encoding algorithm is difficult to infer from the decoding algorithm. This annex is intended as an aid for implementers of the encoding algorithm.

It could be shown that any set of frequency with less or the same number of frequencies as the number of words can be encoded with a careful choice of F1, F2, and so on, i.e. that a set of Wi can be found so that the decoding algorithm given in the main sub-clause will give back the frequency set. The right order is not the order of the frequency values.


J.2	General principle

The encoding algorithm is based on a recursive dichotomy of both the range (i.e. the set of values that are possible) and the subset (the values to encode).

The dichotomy is best understood if the range is seen as a circle. For instance, for the 1023 range.

[pic]

Figure J.1: Circular arrangement of 0..1023

The dichotomy consists in finding a value in the subset such that the diameter determined by this value splits the subset in two equal or nearly equal subsets. In the following case, we see that value 290 is acceptable (the two subsets have 3 elements), when value 250 is not acceptable (the two subsets have 4 and 2 elements):

[pic]

Figure J.2: Example of dichotomy

The pivot value is part of the information field, then the two subsets are renumbered and the same algorithm is applied again on each of them. Because the range is halved at each step, the number of bits needed to encode a pivot value is 1 bit less than the number of bits needed to encode the parent pivot value.

The convention is that if the number of values is even, the left subset (that is to say the values that can be expressed as the pivot value minus some integer between 1 and half the range) will have 1 element more than the right subset.

At each step the subset is numbered from 0 to the range minus 1. The coding in the information field of the pivot value is its value as renumbered, plus 1. Value 0 is reserved to indicate no element.

The order of appearance in the information field of the successive pivot values is particular. If we present the values as organized as a tree, with the left child being the pivot of the left subset and the right child the pivot of the right subset, the order of appearance is given by the following tree:

[pic]



This order has been chosen so that:

  a)	whatever the number N of elements in the set, the meaningful nodes are the first N and the value for all nodes from N+1 on are null (if sent);

  b)	the tree and all subtrees are balanced.

Important properties of these trees are used in the algorithms (with generation 1 corresponding to the root):

  -	Generation g contains 2g-1 nodes, and their indices are 2g-1 to 2g-1;

  -	For generation g, nodes 2g-1 to 2g-1+2g-2-1 are left children, the others are right children;

  -	If node k belongs to generation g, its left child is node k + 2g-1, and its right child is k + 2g;

  -	Reciprocally, if k is a left child from generation g, its parent node is node k - 2g-2, and if k is a right child of generation g, its parent is node k - 2g-1.


J.3	Performances

The number of bits needed to encode a given set of values depends on the number of values and on the range they can span.

For the application on the BCCH and the SACCH (CA and BA information ) 16 octets are available, and the number of frequencies that can be encoded in one information element is the following.

|Range                                    |Number of frequencies                    |
|513 to 1024                              |2 to 16 (17 if frequency 0 is in)        |
|257 to 512                               |2 to 18                                  |
|129 to 256                               |2 to 22                                  |
|113 to 128                               |2 to 29                                  |
|up to 112                                |any                                      |


With two messages (for the BA) the number of frequencies that can be encoded is the following.

|Range                                    |Number of frequencies                    |
|513 to 1024                              |2 to 36 (NOTE 1)                         |
|257 to 512                               |2 to 40 (NOTE 2)                         |
|225 to 256                               |2 to 51 (NOTE 3)                         |
|up to 224                                |any                                      |


  NOTE 1:	A 1024 range can be split cyclically in to two 512 ranges each with less than 18 frequencies; each subset is coded in one message with 512 range format.

  NOTE 2:	A 512 range can be split in to two consecutive 256 ranges. If both sub-ranges contain 22 frequencies or less, it is possible to code each of these in a messages using the 256 range format. Otherwise one of the two ranges contains 23 frequencies or more: 22 of them can be coded in one message using the 256 range format and the remaining frequencies (numbering less than or equal to 18) can be coded in the other message using the 512 range format.

  NOTE 3:	The principles described in notes 1 and 2, above apply in this case.

The frequency short list information element allows the following.

|Range                                    |Number of frequencies                    |
|513 to 1024                              |2 to 7 (8 if frequency 0 is in)          |
|257 to 512                               |2 to 8                                   |
|129 to 256                               |2 to 9                                   |
|57 to 128                                |2 to 12                                  |
|up to 56                                 |any                                      |

J.4	Encoding algorithm

The choice is done recursively as given by the following programs, written in ADA:

Let us define the recursive procedure:

	procedure ENCODE_SUBTREE(in INDEX : INTEGER;
				in SET : SET_OF_VALUE;
				in RANGE : INTEGER);

This procedure is given a set of integer values and an index. It chooses one of those values and computes the corresponding W(INDEX) (considered as a global variable), it splits the set less the value in two equal or nearly equal subsets, and calls itself recursively for each of those subsets, with suitable INDEX.

Assumption: all values in SET lie (inclusively) between 0 and RANGE-1, and they are all distinct.

As written, the program does not assume special values for the range. With a range such as 2k-1, some expressions can be simplified.

Declarative part:
 INDEX_IN_SET : INTEGER;
 begin

First the program tests the leaf conditions :

 if SET'SIZE=0 then
 W(INDEX) := 0;
 return;
 elsif SET'SIZE=1 then
 W(INDEX) := 1 + SET(1);
 return;
 end if;

The following program finds a value in the set such that exactly (SET'SIZE-1)/2 values from the set are between this value plus 1 and this value plus half the range :

 declare
 N : INTEGER;
 J : INTEGER;
 begin
 for I in 1..SET'SIZE loop
 N:=0;
 for J in 1..SET'SIZE loop
 if (SET(J)-SET(I)) mod RANGE <= (RANGE-1)/2 then
 N := N+1;
 end if;
 end loop;

The test compares N-1 because the possible pivot value is counted.

 if N-1 = (SET'SIZE-1)/2 then
 INDEX_IN_SET := I;
 exit;
 end if;
 end loop;
 end;

INDEX_IN_SET is then the index in the list of the pivot value.

The following sets W(INDEX)

 W(INDEX) := SET(INDEX_IN_SET) + 1;

Then the program does the same thing for the two halves of the range delimited by W(INDEX) and W(INDEX)+RANGE/2. First the left subset:

 declare
 SUBSET : SET_OF_VALUE(1..SET'SIZE/2);
 SUBSET_INDEX : INTEGER;
 ORIGIN_VALUE : INTEGER;
 begin
 ORIGIN_VALUE := (SET(INDEX_IN_SET] + (RANGE-1)/2
 + 1) mod RANGE;
 SUBSET_INDEX:=1;
 for I in 1..SET'SIZE loop
 if (SET(I)-ORIGIN_VALUE) mod RANGE) < RANGE/2 then
 SUBSET(SUBSET_INDEX) :=
 (SET(I) - ORIGIN_VALUE) mod RANGE;
 SUBSET_INDEX := SUBSET_INDEX + 1;
 end if;
 end loop;

 ENCODE_SUBTREE(
 INDEX := INDEX +
 GREATEST_POWER_OF_2_LESSER_OR_EQUAL_TO(INDEX),
 SET := SUBSET,
 RANGE := RANGE/2);
 end;

Then the right subset:

 declare
 SUBSET : SET_OF_VALUE(1..(SET'SIZE-1)/2);
 SUBSET_INDEX : INTEGER;
 ORIGIN_VALUE : INTEGER;
 begin
 ORIGIN_VALUE := (SET(INDEX_IN_SET] + 1) mod RANGE;
 SUBSET_INDEX:=1;
 for I in 1..SET'SIZE loop
 if (SET(I)-ORIGIN_VALUE) mod RANGE) < RANGE/2 then
 SUBSET(SUBSET_INDEX) :=
 (SET(I) - ORIGIN_VALUE) mod RANGE;
 SUBSET_INDEX := SUBSET_INDEX + 1;
 end if;
 end loop;
 ENCODE_SUBTREE(
 INDEX := INDEX +
 2*GREATEST_POWER_OF_2_LESSER_OR_EQUAL_TO(INDEX),
 SET := SUBSET,
 RANGE := (RANGE-1)/2);
 end;

 end ENCODE_SUBTREE;

The initial call of the procedure depends on the format. Given some set to encode, the first problem is to verify that it can be encoded, and by so doing to choose the format.

First the encoding process must find the minimum range of the set, that is to say the minimum value R such that there exists one frequency F0 in the set such that all frequencies in the set can be written (F0 + N) mod 1024, with some N, 0 ( N ( R-1. The choice of the format depends on R and the number of frequencies : the 512 range format can be chosen only if R ( 512, the 256 range format can be chosen only if R ( 256, the 128 range format can be chosen only if R ( 128.

If the chosen format is "1024 range", then the program must first check if frequency 0 is in the set. If so the F0 subfield is set to 1, and frequency 0 is removed from the set. Otherwise, the F0 subfield is set to 0. Then ENCODE_SUBTREE is called with INDEX := 1, SET set to the set of values equal to the ARFCN of all frequencies minus 1, and RANGE := 1023.

If the chosen format is "512 range", "256 range" or "128 range", F0 is chosen as ORIG-ARFCN and ENCODE_SUBTREE is called with INDEX := 1, SET set to the set of values equal to the ARFCN of all frequencies except F0, minus F0+1, and RANGE set respectively to 511, 255 or 127.


J.5	Decoding

The decoding algorithm, as given below, is the inverse transform of the program given in the previous sub-clause, for the specific case where the original range is a power of 2 minus 1. It is given a set of integer values W(i), and an original range R, and it builds a set of values from 0..R-1.

The program is here written so that the fact that it is the inverse of the encoding program needs no more proof.

procedure DECODE(in W : array <> of INTEGER;
 out SET : SET_OF_VALUE;
 in ORIGINAL_RANGE : INTEGER);

 -- local variables
 INDEX : 1..W'SIZE;	RANGE : INTEGER;
 N : INTEGER;

 begin
 for K in 1..W'SIZE loop

The next loop follows the tree from child to parent, from the node of index K to the root (index 1). For each iteration the node of index INDEX is tackled. The corresponding range is RANGE, and N is the value of the element in the range defined by the node.

The data are set to their initial values :

 INDEX := K;
 RANGE := ORIGINAL_RANGE / GREATEST_POWER_OF_2_LESSER_OR_EQUAL_TO(INDEX);
 N := W(INDEX) - 1;

 while INDEX>1 loop

Due to the assumption that the original range is a power of two minus one, the range for the parent node can be easily computed, and does not depend upon whether the current node is a left or right child :

	RANGE := 2*RANGE + 1;

Let us note J := 2g-1, g being the generation of node INDEX. We have J = GREATEST_POWER_OF_2_LESSER_OR_EQUAL_TO(INDEX).

The numbering used in the tree is such that the nodes of index J to J + J/2 - 1 are left children, and the nodes of index J/2 to J+J-1 are right children. Hence an easy test to distinguish left and right children:

 if 2*INDEX <
 3*GREATEST_POWER_OF_2_LESSER_OR_EQUAL_TO(INDEX)
 then -- left child

The next computation gives the index of the parent node of the node of index INDEX, for a left child :

 INDEX := INDEX -
 GREATEST_POWER_OF_2_LESSER_OR_EQUAL_TO(INDEX)/2;

The next formula is the inverse of the renumbering appearing in the encoding for a left child. It gives the value of the parent node in the range defined by the grand-parent node:

 N := (N + W(INDEX) - 1 + (RANGE-1)/2 + 1)
 mod RANGE;
 else -- right child

The next computation gives the index of the parent node of the node of index INDEX, for a right child :

 INDEX := INDEX - GREATEST_POWER_OF_2_LESSER_OR_EQUAL_TO(INDEX);

The next formula is the inverse of the renumbering appearing in the encoding for a right child:

	N := (N + W(INDEX) - 1 + 1) mod RANGE;
	end if;
	end loop;
	F(K) := N;
	end loop;
	end;

A careful study will show that the programs given in the main part of the Technical Specification are equivalent to the one presented here. The main difference is the use of different remnant variables to remove most of the calls to the function giving the greatest power of 2 less than or equal to some integer.

The decoding must be terminated by the correction specific to the format.


J.6	A detailed example

Let us take the following subset of 16 elements of the set [0..1023] : [13, 71, 122, 191, 251, 321, 402, 476, 521, 575, 635, 701, 765, 831, 906, 981]

Range 1024 format will be used. Frequency 0 is not in the set, thus field F0 is set to 0. The set is renumbered, so as to give a subset of 0..1022 : [12, 70, 121, 190, 250, 320, 401, 475, 520, 574, 634, 700, 764, 830, 905, 980].

For the first node (corresponding to W(1)), the value 121 satisfies the requirements. The opposite value is 121 + 511 = 632. There are 8 values between 633 and 120 (namely the left-hand subset 634, 700, 764, 830, 905, 980, 12 and 70), and 7 values between 122 and 632 (namely the right-hand subset 190, 250, 320, 401, 475, 520 and 574).

The encoded value W(1) is 121 + 1, i.e. 122.

The second node (corresponding to W(2)) is the left-hand child of the first node. The corresponding subtree has to encode for the left-hand subset, renumbered beginning at 633. This gives the following 8 element subset of 0..510, ordered as resulting from the example of algorithm: [402, 460, 1, 67, 131, 197, 272, 347]. Out of these values, 1 splits the set in 4 and 3, and the encoded value W(2) is 2.

Similarly, the third node (W(3)) is the right-hand child of the first node and then the corresponding subtree encodes for the right-hand subset, renumbered starting at 122. This gives the following set of 0..510: [68, 128, 198, 279, 353, 398, 452]. Out of these values, 68 splits the set into 3 and 3, and the encoded value W(3) is 69.

The same method is applied for all nodes, giving the following encoded values per node:

|Node         |Value         |
|1            |122           |
|2            |2             |
|3            |69            |
|4            |204           |
|5            |75            |
|6            |66            |
|7            |60            |
|8            |70            |
|9            |83            |
|10           |3             |
|11           |24            |
|12           |67            |
|13           |54            |
|14           |64            |
|15           |70            |
|16           |9             |


The encoding then consists in formatting, in that order:

  -	122 on 10 bits, then 2 and 69 on 9 bits each, then 204, 75, 66 and 60 on 8 bits each, then 70, 83, 3, 24, 67, 54, 64 and 70 on 7 bits each, and finally 9 on 6 bits.

Conversely the decoding can be done easily. For instance for node 2, the original value is:

  -	(122 - 512 + 2) smod 1023 = 635.

For node 14, we have as original value:

  -	(122 - 512 + (2 + (66 + 64)smod 255)smod 511)smod 1023 = 765.
