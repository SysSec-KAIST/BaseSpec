         Foreword

This Technical Specification (TS) has been produced by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP).

The present document defines the coding of information necessary for support of supplementary service operation on the mobile radio interface layer 3 within the 3GPP system.1

The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work within the TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the TSG modify the contents of the present document, it will be re-released by the TSG with an identifying change of release date and an increase in version number as follows:

  Version x.y.z

  where:

    x	the first digit:

       1	presented to TSG for information;

       2	presented to TSG for approval;

       3	or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.

    y	the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.

    z	the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been incorporated in the document.



         1	Scope

The present document contains the coding of information necessary for support of supplementary service operation on the mobile radio interface layer 3.

Clause 2 gives the functional definitions and contents of messages for call independent supplementary service operations. Messages necessary for support of call related supplementary service operations are defined in TS 24.008.

Clause 3 gives the general format and coding for messages used for call independent supplementary service and the format and coding of information elements used for both call related and call independent supplementary service operations.

Clause 4 gives the specification of the call related and call independent supplementary service operations.

2	Message functional definitions and contents


2.1	General

This clause defines the structure of the messages of the layer 3 protocol defined in TS 24.080. These messages are standard L3 messages as defined in TS 24.007.

Each definition includes:

  a)	a brief description of the message;

  b)	a table listing the information elements in the order of their appearance in the message. In a sequence of consecutive IEs with half octet length, the first IE occupies bits 1 to 4 of octet N, the second bits 5 to 8 of octet N, the third bits 1 to 4 of octet N+1 etc..

    	For each IE the table indicates:

    1)	the information element identifier, in hexadecimal notation, if the IE has format T, TV or TLV. If the IEI has half octet length, it is specified by a notation representing the IEI as a hexadecimal digit followed by a "-" (example: B-);

    2)	the name of the IE (which gives an idea of the semantics of the element), which is used in this and other specifications as a reference to the IE within the message;

    3)	the name of the type of the IE (which indicates the coding of the value part of the IE), and a reference to a description of the value part of the IE;

    4)	the presence requirement indication (M, C or O) for the IE, as defined in TS 24.007;

    5)	the format of the IE (T, V, TV, LV, TLV) as defined in TS 24.007;

    6)	the length of the IE (or permissible range of lengths), in octets, in the message, where "?" means that the maximum length of the IE is only constrained by the link layer protocol, and in the case of the facility IE by possible further considerations specified in TS 24.010. This indication is non-normative.

  c)	Subclauses specifying conditions for IEs with presence requirement C or O in the relevant message. Together with other conditions specified in TS 24.080, TS 24.010 or TS 24.08x and 24.09x-series this defines when the IE shall be included or not, what non-presence of such IEs means, and (for IEs with presence requirement C) the static conditions for presence and/or non-presence of the IEs (see TS 24.007).


2.2	Messages for supplementary services control

Table 2.1 summarizes the messages for call independent supplementary services control (see TS 24.010 for a detailed description of call independent supplementary service messages).

2.5.1	Cause

This information element shall be included when the functional handling of the Cause IE is specified in the service description or TS 29.011. If the functional handling of the Cause IE is not specified, the receiving entity may ignore the IE.


2.5.2	Facility

This information element shall be included as required by the service description and the procedures defined in TS 24.010.


3	General message format and information elements coding

The figures and text in this clause describe message contents. Within each octet, the bit designated "bit 1" is transmitted first, followed by bits 2, 3, 4, etc. Similarly, the octet shown at the top of each figure is sent first.


3.1	Overview

Within the layer 3 protocol defined in TS 24.080, every message is a standard L3 message as defined in TS 24.007. This means that the message consists of the following parts:

  a)	protocol discriminator;

  b)	transaction identifier;

  c)	message type;

  d)	other information elements, as required.

Unless specified otherwise, a particular information element may be present only once in a given message.

When a field extends over more than one octet, the order of bit values progressively decreases as the octet number increases. The least significant bit of the field is represented by the lowest numbered bit of the highest numbered octet of the field.


3.2	Protocol discriminator

The Protocol Discriminator (PD) and its use are defined in TS 24.007. TS 24.080 defines the protocols relating to the PD values:

  1 0 1 1	supplementary services (call independent).


3.3	Transaction identifier

For general rules, format and coding of transaction identifier values, see TS 24.008.


3.4	Message type

The message type IE and its use are defined in TS 24.007. Table 3.1 defines the value part of the message type IE used in the supplementary service protocol.

For messages transmitted via CS domain the following applies:

  -	When the radio connection started with a core network node of earlier than R99, bit 8 shall be set to 0 and bit 7 is reserved for the send sequence number in messages sent from the mobile station. In messages sent from the network, bits 7 and 8 are coded with a "0". See 3GPP TS 24.007 [4].

  -	When the radio connection started with a core network node of R'99 or later, bits 7 and 8 are reserved for the send sequence number in messages sent from the mobile station. In messages sent from the network, bits 7 and 8 are coded with a "0". See 3GPP TS 24.007 [4].

For messages transmitted via PS domain the following applies:

  -	No sequence number shall be used. Bits 7 and 8 shall be coded with a "0". See 3GPP TS 24.007 [4]. If a sequence number is received on the network side it shall be ignored.


3.5	Other information elements

These information elements are coded according to the general coding rules as defined in TS 24.008.

Table 3.2 contains the code-points allocated to the information elements used in messages defined in this specification. All IEs are defined in TS 24.008, but the content of the Facility and SS version indicator IEs are defined within this specification.

3.6	Facility information element

The purpose of the Facility information element is to indicate the invocation and operation of supplementary services, identified by the corresponding operation code within the Facility information element.

The Facility information element is coded as shown in figure 3.1 and tables 3.3 to 3.17.

The Facility is a type 4 information element with no upper length limit except that given by the maximum number of octets in a L3 message, see 3GPP TS 44.006.

|requirements.                                                                  |


Figure 3.1: Facility information element


3.6.1	Component (octet 3 etc.)

This subclause provides the formats and encoding of components in the Facility information element. Formats and encoding methods make use of and is a subset of ITU-T Rec. Q.773 (Transaction Capabilities formats and Encoding) and T/S 43/BB. The used part of ITU-T Rec. Q.773 respectively T/S 43/BB is almost the same as the Component Portion of TC messages. The only difference is that returnResultNotLast is not used.

This subclause is further based on:

  -	ITU-T Rec. X.680 (Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1): Specification of Basic Notation);

  -	ITU-T Rec. X.690 (Specification of Basic Encoding Rules (BER), Canonical Encoding Rules (CER) and Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER));

and is consistent with these ITU-T Recommendations.

The parameters in tables 3.3 to 3.6 may be one of the following:

  -	a Sequence of Parameters;

  -	a Set of Parameters;

  -	a specific Parameter with its own tag (i.e. not part of a Sequence or Set);

  -	nothing at all (i.e. absent).

  NOTE:	Concerning the general rules for encoding (structure of encoding, identifier octets, length octets, etc.) see ITU-T Rec. X.690. For these general rules the same exceptions apply as stated in TS 29.002. This holds also for tables 3.3 to 3.6.

3.6.3	Component ID tag

The term Component ID refers to the Invoke ID or the Linked ID. The Component ID tag is coded as shown in table 3.8.

Table 3.8: Coding of Component ID tag

|Component ID tag                                                                      |8  7  6  5  4  3  2  1                              |
|Invoke ID                                                                             |0  0  0  0  0  0  1  0                              |
|Linked ID (note)                                                                      |1  0  0  0  0  0  0  0                              |
|NOTE: This tag differs from the Invoke ID tag, which is coded as a Universal INTEGER, in order to distinguish it from the following tag   |
|(Operation Code) which is also coded as a Universal INTEGER.                                                                              |


The length of a Component ID is 1 octet.

An Invoke Component has one or two Component IDs: an Invoke ID, and if it is desired to associate the Invoke with a previous Invoke, then the Linked ID is provided in addition to the Invoke ID.

Return Result and Return Error Components have one Component ID, called an Invoke ID which is the reflection of the Invoke ID of the Invoke Component to which they are responding.

The Reject Component uses as its Invoke ID, the Invoke ID in the Component being rejected. If this ID is unavailable (e.g. due to mutilation of the message not detected by lower layers), then the Invoke ID tag is replaced with a universal NULL tag as shown in table 3.9. Universal NULL has always length = 0.

Any kind of component, except a reject component, may be rejected.

Table 3.9: Coding of NULL tag

|                                                                                                |8  7  6  5  4  3  2  1                       |
|NULL tag                                                                                        |0  0  0  0  0  1  0  1                       |


If an Invoke containing both Invoke and Linked IDs is being rejected, only the Invoke ID is used in the Reject Component.


3.6.4	Operation Code

Each Operation is assigned an Operation Code to identify it. An Operation Code follows an Operation Code tag and Operation Code length. The Operation Code tag is coded as shown in table 3.10.

Table 3.10: Coding of Operation Code tag

|                                                                                                |8  7  6  5  4  3  2  1                       |
|Operation Code tag                                                                              |0  0  0  0  0  0  1  0                       |


The Operation Codes for the different Operations are defined in subclause 4.5.


3.6.5	Sequence and Set tags

When there is more than one parameter in a Component (applicable to all Component types), they follow the Sequence or Set tag, which are coded universal, constructor as shown in table 3.11.

Table 3.11: Coding of Sequence and set tags

|Sequence and set tags                                                                           |8  7  6  5  4  3  2  1                       |

|Set tag                                                                                         |0  0  1  1  0  0  0  1                       |



3.6.6	Error Code

Each Error is assigned a value (Error Code) to identify it.

An Error Code follows an Error Code tag and Error Code length. The Error Code tag is coded as shown in table 3.12.

Table 3.12: Coding of Error Code tag

|                                                                                                |8  7  6  5  4  3  2  1                       |

4	Supplementary services operation specifications


4.1	General

This clause specifies the abstract syntax for the Supplementary Service protocol using the Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1), defined in ITU-T Rec. X.680 and X.681.

The mapping of OPERATION and ERROR to components is defined in clause 3 of this specification.

The encoding rules which are applicable to the defined abstract syntax are the Basic Encoding Rules for Abstract Syntax Notation One, defined in ITU-T Rec. X.690 with the same exceptions as stated in TS 29.002. For each Supplementary Service parameter which has to be transferred by a Supplementary Service message, there is a PDU field (an ASN.1 NamedType) whose ASN.1 identifier has the same name as the corresponding parameter, except for the differences required by the ASN.1 notation (blanks between words are removed, the first letter of the first word is lower-case and the first letter of the following words are capitalized (e.g. "bearer service" is mapped to "bearerService"). In addition some words may be abbreviated as follows:

  -	ms	mobile subscriber;

  -	ss	supplementary services;

  -	cug	closed user group.

The ASN.1 data type which follows the words "ARGUMENT", "PARAMETER" or "RESULT" (for information objects of class "OPERATION" and "ERROR") is always optional from a syntactic point of view. However, except specific mention, it has to be considered as mandatory from a semantic point of view. When in an invoke component, a mandatory element is missing in any component or inner data structure, a reject component is returned with the problem code "Mistyped Parameter". When an optional element is missing in an invoke component or in an inner data structure while it is required by the context, an error component is returned; the associated type of error is "DataMissing".

In case an element is defined as mandatory in the protocol description (TS 24.080 including imports from TS 29.002), but is not present according to the service description (stage 1 to stage 3), the ASN.1 protocol description takes precedence over the diagrams in the TS 24.08x and 24.09x-series of technical specifications.

When possible operations and errors are imported from TS 29.002 thereby making the MSC transparent to most of the messages sent to or from the MS.

Timer values for operations which require timers are shown as ASN.1 comments.

 The extension marker "…" shall be used in the same way as described in TS 29.002 and shall be supported on the radio interface by the MS and the network for all operations defined in this specification including those imported from TS 29.002.


4.2	Operation types

Table 4.1 summarizes the operations defined for supplementary services in this specification and shows which of these operations are call related and call independent. The terms "call related" and "call independent" are defined in 3GPP TS 24.010 [6]. Refer to 3GPP TS 24.171 [15] for operations for E-UTRAN LCS..

4.2.2.2	eraseSS (MS --> network)

This operation is invoked by an MS to erase data related to a supplementary service in the network. When no BasicService parameter is provided, the erasure applies to all provisioned and applicable basic services.


4.2.2.3	activateSS (MS --> network)

This operation is invoked by an MS to request the network for a supplementary service activation. When no BasicService parameter is provided, the activation applies to all provisioned and applicable basic services.


4.2.2.4	deactivateSS (MS --> network)

This operation is invoked by an MS to request the network for a supplementary service deactivation. When no BasicService parameter is provided, the deactivation applies to all provisioned and applicable basic services.


4.2.2.5	interrogateSS (MS --> network)

This operation is invoked by an MS to request the network for a supplementary service interrogation. When no BasicService parameter is provided, the interrogation applies to all provisioned and applicable basic services.


4.2.2.6	notifySS (network --> MS)

This operation is invoked by the network to forward a supplementary service notification towards a mobile subscriber.


4.2.2.7	registerPassword (MS --> network)

This operation is invoked by an MS to register a new password related to the management by the subscriber himself of subscription data in the HLR. The operation "Register password" will be successful if the subscriber can provide the old password, the new password and the new password again as results of 3 subsequent operations "Get password".


4.2.2.8	getPassword (network --> MS)

This operation is invoked by the network to request a password from the mobile subscriber. It may be used to allow the registration of a new password or the management of subscription data by the subscriber himself (e.g. modification of call barring activation status).


4.2.2.9	processUnstructuredSS-Data (MS --> network)

This operation is invoked by an MS to relay unstructured information in order to allow end to end SS operation between the MS and the network following specific rules (e.g. embedding of keypad commands). The operation is used in order to provide backward compatibility (see TS 24.090).

This operation is invoked by an MS to start an unstructured supplementary service data application in the network.


4.2.2.11	unstructuredSS-Request (network --> MS)

This operation is invoked by the network to request unstructured information from the MS in order to perform an unstructured supplementary service data application.


4.2.2.12	unstructuredSS-Notify (network --> MS)

This operation is invoked by the network to give an unstructured supplementary service notification to the mobile user.


4.2.2.13	forwardCheckSSIndication (network --> MS)

This operation is invoked by the network to indicate to the mobile subscriber that the status of supplementary services may not be correct in the network. The procedures for initiating ForwardCheckSSIndication are specified in TS 29.002.


4.2.2.14	forwardChargeAdvice (network --> MS)

This operation is invoked by the network to forward Advice of Charge information to the mobile subscriber.


4.2.2.15	buildMPTY (MS --> network)

4.2.2.16	holdMPTY (MS --> network)

This operation is invoked by an MS to put the MS-connection to a multi party call (invoked by that MS) on hold.


4.2.2.17	retrieveMPTY (MS --> network)

This operation is invoked by an MS to request retrieval of a multi party call held by that MS.


4.2.2.18	splitMPTY (MS --> network)

This operation is invoked by an MS to request a private communication with one of the remote parties in a multi party call invoked by that MS.


4.2.2.19	forwardCUG-Info (MS --> network)

This operation is used by an MS to explicitly invoke a CUG call.


4.2.2.20	explicitCT (MS --> Network)

This operation is invoked by an MS to request the network to connect the two calls of the subscriber.


4.2.2.21	accessRegisterCCEntry (MS --> Network)

This operation is invoked by an MS to activate a CCBS request in the network.


4.2.2.22	callDeflection (MS --> Network)

This operation is invoked by an MS to request the network to deflect the incoming call to a specified destination.


4.2.2.23	userUserService (MS --> Network, Network --> MS)

This operation is invoked by an MS to request the network to allow an MS to send/receive information to/from another subscriber in association with a call.


4.2.2.24	lcs-LocationNotification (network --> MS)

This operation is invoked by the network to request a verification from the mobile subscriber for the attempted location request or to notify the subscriber about authorized location request.

Refer to 3GPP TS 24.171 [15] for lcs-LocationNotification operations for E-UTRAN LCS.


4.2.2.25	lcs-MOLR (MS --> Network)

This operation is invoked by an MS to request the network to start location procedure, which is used to provide the MS location estimate, location assistance data or deciphering keys for broadcast assistance data.

Refer to 3GPP TS 24.171 [15] for lcs-MOLR operations for E-UTRAN LCS.


4.2.2.26	lcs-AreaEventRequest (network --> MS)

This operation is invoked by the network to request a  mobile to start the deferred MT-LR Area Event procedure.


4.2.2.27	lcs-AreaEventReport (MS --> network)

This operation is invoked by an MS to respond that the requested Area Event has occurred.


4.2.2.28	lcs-AreaEventCancellation (network --> MS)

This operation is invoked by the network to request a  mobile to cancel the deferred MT-LR Area Event procedure.


4.2.2.29	lcs-PeriodicLocationRequest (network --> MS)

This operation is invoked by the network to request a mobile to start periodic reporting procedure.


4.2.2.30	lcs-LocationUpdate (network --> MS)

This operation is invoked by the network to notify the mobile about the delivery of location estimates to an external LCS Client, or to deliver a location estimate to the mobile in a periodic location procedure.


4.2.2.31	lcs-PeriodicLocationCancellation (network --> MS)

This operation is invoked by the network to request a mobile to cancel the periodic reporting procedure.


4.2.2.32	lcs-PeriodicTriggeredInvoke (network --> MS)

This operation is invoked by the network to request a mobile to start a periodic and triggered reporting procedure.

For the definition of the allowed operations for the individual supplementary services, see TS 24.08x and 24.09x-series of technical specifications.


4.3.2.5	ss-ErrorStatus

This error is returned by the network when it is requested to perform an operation which is not compatible with the current status of the relevant supplementary service. The current status may be given as additional information by use of the SS-parameter.


4.3.2.6	ss-NotAvailable

This error is returned by the network when it is requested to perform an operation on a supplementary service which is not available in the current location area.


4.3.2.7	ss-SubscriptionViolation

This error is returned by the network when it is requested to perform an operation on a supplementary service, transgressing the subscription restrictions. The nature of the restriction or the transgressed options may be sent as parameters.


4.3.2.8	ss-Incompatibility

This error is returned by the network when it is requested for a supplementary service operation incompatible with the status of an other supplementary service or with the teleservice or bearer service for which the operation is requested. This error shall only be used if the operation is not compatible for even a subset of the teleservice group or bearer service group specified in the request. The identity and status of the conflicting service may also be indicated. The additional information may contain the SS-code parameter, the Basic Service Group parameter and the SS-status parameter.


4.3.2.9	systemFailure

This error is returned by the network, when it cannot perform an operation because of a failure in the network.


4.3.2.10	dataMissing

This error is returned by the network when an optional parameter is missing in an invoke component or an inner data structure, while it is required by the context of the request.


4.3.2.11	unexpectedDataValue

This error is returned by the network when it receives a parameter with an unexpected value, without type violation.


4.3.2.12	passwordRegistrationFailure

This error is returned when a password registration procedure fails because of abnormal subscriber inputs. A more specific diagnostic may be passed as error parameter and indicates situations such as:

  -	invalid password format;

  -	new passwords mismatch.


4.3.2.13	negativePasswordCheck

This error is returned to indicate the negative result of a password check because the subscriber has not provided the required password or has provided a password which does not match the valid one.


4.3.2.14	facilityNotSupported

This error is returned by the network receiving a request about a facility which is not supported in the PLMN.


4.3.2.15	resourcesNotAvailable

This error is returned by the network to the MS if temporarily there are no resources to support e.g. a multi party call available in the network.


4.3.2.16	maxNumberOfMPTY-ParticipantsExceeded

This error is returned by the network to the MS if the request must be rejected because the number of subscribers to join a multi party call would exceed the maximum value.


4.3.2.17	callBarred

This error is returned by the network to the MS when call independent subscriber control procedures are barred by the operator. The parameter "operator barring" shall be included.


4.3.2.18	numberOfPW-AttemptsViolation

This error is returned by the network to the MS when the maximum number of wrong password attempts is exceeded.


4.3.2.19	absentSubscriber

This error is returned when the subscriber has activated the detach service or the system detects the absence condition. This error is not used on the radio interface but only between network entities.


4.3.2.20	illegalSubscriber

This error is returned when illegality of the access has been established by use of authentication procedure. This error is not used on the radio interface but only between network entities.


4.3.2.21	illegalEquipment

This error is returned when the IMEI check procedure has shown that the IMEI is blacklisted or not white—listed. This error is not used on the radio interface but only between network entities.


4.3.2.22	ussd-Busy

This error is returned by the MS to the network when the MS is not able to process the unstructured supplementary service data operation due to an on-going MMI input of the user or an already existing call independent supplementary service transaction.


4.3.2.23	unknownAlphabet

This error is returned by the MS or the network when the alphabet/language used for the unstructured supplementary service data operation is not known by the network or the MS.


4.3.2.24	invalidDeflectedToNumber

This error is returned if the requested deflected-to number is invalid.


4.3.2.25	specialServiceCode

This error is returned if diversion to a special service code was requested.


4.3.2.26	deflectionToServedSubscriber

This error is returned if a diversion to the served subscriber's number was requested.


4.3.2.27	rejectedByNetwork

This error is returned by the network when the network rejects User-to-User Signalling service request.


4.3.2.28	rejectedByUser

This error is returned by the remote party when the remote party rejects User-to-User Signalling service request.


4.3.2.29	positionMethodFailure

This error is returned by the network when the network is unable to obtain any of the location information requested or none of the information obtained satisfies the requested LCS QoS or if requested LCS assistance data could not be transferred or requested deciphering keys for broadcast assistance data could not be returned.


4.3.2.30	resourceLimitation


This error is returned when a requested operation cannot be performed due to insufficient resources.


4.4	Data types and identifiers


4.4.1	General

The data types used in the SS protocol specifications are described in the ASN.1 module provided in subclause 4.4.2, while subclause 4.4.3 provides an overview of the identifiers used in SS ASN.1 specifications.

Named values have been defined in the following module for the upper boundaries of the value ranges associated to several sub-type specifications.


4.4.2	ASN.1 data types

This subclause provides an ASN.1 module defining the abstract data types in operations and errors specification. Only data types which are specific for this specification are defined. All other data types are imported from MAP together with the import of operations and errors.
